What is Orphanet ?

   Orphanet is a unique resource, gathering and improving knowledge on
   rare diseases so as to improve the diagnosis, care and treatment of
   patients with rare diseases. Orphanet aims to provide high-quality
   information on rare diseases, and ensure equal access to knowledge for
   all stakeholders. Orphanet also maintains the Orphanet rare disease
   nomenclature (ORPHAnumber), essential in improving the visibility of
   rare diseases in health and research information systems.

   Orphanet was established in France by the INSERM (French National
   Institute for Health and Medical Research) in 1997.This initiative
   became a European endeavour from 2000, supported by grants from the
   European Commission: Orphanet has gradually grown to a Consortium of 40
   countries, within Europe and across the globe.
