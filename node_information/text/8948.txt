   ABSTRACT

   People in many parts of the world commonly share their beds not only
   with human partners but also with dogs and cats. Self-report and
   actigraphy data have shown that sleeping with an adult human partner
   has both positive and negative impacts on human sleep, but there has
   been little exploration of the impacts that pets have on human sleep
   quality. We collected survey data online from 962 adult women living in
   the United States to investigate relationships between pet ownership
   and human sleep. Fifty-five percent of participants shared their bed
   with at least one dog and 31% with at least one cat. In addition, 57%
   of participants shared their bed with a human partner. Our findings did
   not show a strong relationship between pet ownership status or
   bedsharing conditions and sleep quality as assessed by the Pittsburgh
   Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), although according to this measure, a high
   percentage of study participants did experience sleep quality deficits.
   It is possible that pet ownership contributed to the high global PSQI
   scores we observed, especially since all but 7% of participants resided
   with dogs and/or cats. Other measures included in this study indicate
   that dogs and cats, and where they sleep, may indeed affect sleep
   habits and perceptions of sleep quality. Dog owners had earlier
   bedtimes and wake times than individuals who had cats but no dogs.
   Compared with human bed partners, dogs who slept in the owner’s bed
   were perceived to disturb sleep less and were associated with stronger
   feelings of comfort and security. Conversely, cats who slept in their
   owner’s bed were reported to be equally as disruptive as human
   partners, and were associated with weaker feelings of comfort and
   security than both human and dog bed partners. Follow-up research is
   necessary to determine if pet owners’ perceptions of pets’ impacts on
   their sleep align with objective measures of sleep quality.
   Keywords: cats, companion animals, dogs, human–animal
   interaction, pets, sleep habits, sleep quality

   ABSTRACT

   The present study examined the beliefs of individuals with normative
   identities regarding sex, gender and sexual orientation. Data were
   collected from 691 heterosexual cisgender women and men using an online
   survey. Participants indicated their agreement regarding their beliefs
   about the nature of sex, gender and sexual orientation along four
   dimensions: fixed, binary (i.e. essentialist beliefs), fluid and
   continuous (i.e. social constructionist beliefs). Data analyses for the
   present study centred on four 2 (Participant Gender Identity: Woman vs.
   Man) × 3 (Identity Construct: Sex vs. Gender vs. Sexual Orientation)
   mixed ANOVAs. Findings suggested that sex, gender and sexual
   orientation are understood to be distinct and that essentialist and
   constructionist beliefs follow reverse patterns. Heterosexual cisgender
   adults rated sex as the most fixed and binary, followed by gender, and
   then sexual orientation. Conversely, participants rated sexual
   orientation as the most fluid and continuous followed by gender, and
   sex. Men consistently rated all three constructs as more fixed and
   binary and less fluid and continuous than did women. Discussion focuses
   on the utility of investigating normative beliefs about sex, gender and
   sexual orientation as parallel constructs.
   KEYWORDS: Essentialism, sex, gender, sexual orientation, social
   constructionism

   Abstract

   In the UK, incinerators are still seen as a satisfactory answer to the
   problem of getting rid of the increasing quantities of waste, including
   increasing amounts of synthetics. This report examines the scientific
   evidence from all sources concerning the health implications of waste
   incineration, and its costs, explicit and hidden.

   The report reviews what is known about the range of pollutants released
   by incinerators and their health effects. The major air pollutants are
   fine airborne particulates (2.5 µm diameter and smaller), toxic metals,
   and organic chemicals. The precise content of the emissions varies with
   the material incinerated: emitted chemicals include persistent organic
   pollutants, hormone disrupters, and carcinogens, but not all the
   organic components have been identified. In addition, the ash produced
   includes large quantities of highly toxic fine fly ash (air pollution
   control residues), which pose important long‐term health risks.

   Dangers from chemicals have been overlooked in the past: chemicals such
   as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)
   were regarded as safe on introduction, but were banned many years later
   because of widespread ill‐effects. Incineration is a source of emission
   of heavy metals and these have a range of harmful health effects. In
   the last 10 years, the health dangers of another major incinerator
   emission, fine particulates, have become widely recognized. These are
   associated with an increased incidence of lung cancer, but also with a
   linear increase in mortality (with no safe level), particularly from
   cardiovascular causes. Fine particulates are inspired deep into the
   lungs and carry other toxins, adsorbed to them, into the blood stream.

   Increased adult lung cancer and all cancers have been found in the
   vicinity of incinerators: the peak seems to occur at least 14 years
   after incinerator start‐up. There have been no direct studies of the
   incidence of cardiac illnesses around incinerators, but as incinerators
   are a major source of fine particulates, and ischaemic heart disease is
   a relatively common cause of death, substantial excess cardiac
   mortality and morbidity would be predicted. The foetus and infant are
   particularly susceptible to damage from toxins and carcinogens, and
   there are indications that some effects may be passed to the next
   generation. Increased birth defects and an increased incidence of
   childhood cancers have been demonstrated around incinerators.

   Health costs should always be considered in determining strategies for
   waste disposal. Other methods are available that are safer and cheaper
   in the long term and far cheaper if the high health costs of
   incineration are taken into consideration. We recommend that these more
   modern methods should be used, and that a more stringent and
   independent monitoring system should be introduced. In our view,
   incinerators, with their high risks and high health costs, are a poor
   choice of technology for waste disposal: more modern and safer
   technologies should be used in the future. Tackling the problems of
   both the amount and the nature of waste generated is also of critical
   importance.

   Abstract

   A critical analysis of the present situation on the global water
   resources assessment is made. Basic data and methodological approaches
   used by the author for the assessment and prediction of water
   resources, water use and water availability on the global scale are
   briefly described. On the basis of data generalization of the world
   hydrological network new data are given on the dynamics of renewable
   water resources of the continents, physiographic and economic regions,
   selected countries as well as on the river water inflow to the world
   ocean. The results of the assessments for the 20^th century and for the
   future before 2010–2025 on the water supply for municipal, industrial
   and agricultural needs as well as an additional evaporation from
   reservoirs are presented. Loads on water resources and water
   availability depending on socio-economic and phisiographic factors are
   analyzed; regions of water scarcity and water resources deficit are
   discovered. Possible ways of water supply improvement and elimination
   of water resources deficit in different regions and countries are
   discussed
   Keywords: Assessment, natural-economic regions, global renewable water
   resources, water availability, water consumption, water use, water

   Abstract

   Agriculture is the largest contributor to biodiversity loss with
   expanding impacts due to changing consumption patterns and growing
   populations. Agriculture destroys biodiversity by converting natural
   habitats to intensely managed systems and by releasing pollutants,
   including greenhouses gases. Food value chains further amplify impacts
   including through energy use, transport and waste. Reducing the food
   system’s toll on biodiversity is a critical challenge. The ‘sparing or
   sharing’ debate contrasts two response pathways: intensifying
   agriculture to release other land for protection versus
   biodiversity-friendly farming over larger areas. Most conservation
   policies focus on intensification and set-aside but recent research
   challenges these assumptions. The Global Land Outlook of the UN
   Convention to Combat Desertification highlights how modern farming is
   undermining the sustainability of large land areas. Intensification has
   not solved the biodiversity crisis and has often made it worse.
   Effective responses must involve both producers and consumers, and
   require a mixture of conservation, sustainable management and
   restoration. Agricultural land serves many purposes beyond food
   production and mechanisms are needed to pay farmers for wider
   stewardship of land resources. A multifunctional landscape approach
   balances different needs at a landscape scale while incorporating
   site-level specificity on land use, demand, and condition. At the same
   time, consumers play a critical role in reducing unsustainable food
   waste. Many of the techniques and strategies for biodiversity-friendly
   farming systems exist; the challenge is to bring them to scale.
   Keywords: Agriculture, biodiversity, landscape
   approach, farming, sustainable management
