   Like An Indie Rock XCOM

   In my couple of hours with turn-based survival game Overland, I’ve
   lived multiple short, doomed lives in the post-apocalypse. These lives
   unfolded in in gas stations and on street corners, and they were filled
   with the pursuit of gas cans and pieces of garbage, like potted plants
   and lighters. Overland’s art is minimalist, but the game feels stuffed
   with mournful personality.

   Overland is a game by Finji, out today for PC, Switch, and Apple Arcade
   (Correction 2:03pm—Overland is also available for Xbox and PS4.). It
   takes place in a ravaged America beset by spiky monsters. They’re
   attracted to sound, and they call up reinforcements from underground
   when they’re injured or killed. At the start of the game, you’re
   assigned a random survivor and a car that’s running low on gas. Each
   level is a diorama-esque grid that you move across, gathering supplies,
   fighting or avoiding monsters, and saving other survivors to add to
   your road trip across America.

   In between turns, you choose a new location to go to from a sparse map.
   There might be survivors at one stop, who you can add to your party, or
   gas, or supplies like weapons or first aid kits. It costs different
   amounts of gas to get to these locations. Gas is hard to come by and
   was my most sought-after resource. I stayed too long in places in
   pursuit of it, or made risky treks across levels to drop items in favor
   of gas cans, go back to my car to fill it up, and then return for my
   other loot. Once, when I didn’t have enough gas to get to a new
   location, I found myself dumped into a dark level full of monsters. I
   did not survive long.

   The need for gas places a unique emphasis on your car. It’s the way you
   get from place to place, but it has more uses and presence than that.
   It can run over monsters, or be moved along the road to get closer to
   supplies or give your characters less far to walk. It also takes damage
   easily. In one playthrough, a large monster battered my car too many
   times, and I had to hurry to get my survivors out of the vehicle as
   flames flickered from the hood. Between the enemy and scenery
   placement, I couldn’t get them all far enough away from the car. My car
   exploded, killing two of them and forcing the remaining two to try,
   unsuccessfully, to escape the level on foot. I haven’t yet discovered
   how far you can get on foot, though some levels have cars you can
   requisition. The car’s necessity and fragility makes it feel like
   another one of your companions rather than just a means to an end.

   Overland is tough, but it’s also slow. Enemies aren’t as aggressive as
   they are in similar turn-based games like XCOM. You have time to avoid
   attacks, and enemies can often be killed in one strike. Also, the
   reinforcement monsters they call up take time to surface. Looting is
   also time-consuming, requiring you to move to a container, search it,
   and then fiddle with your inventory if need be. The car must be
   entered, then turned on, then driven. Levels are broken up by brief
   cutscenes set to moody indie music where characters briefly talk and
   then you choose your next location. The game doesn’t need these
   scenes—it’d be more expedient just to take you back to your map—but the
   methodical pace of them adds to the mood. This slowness makes the game
   feel post-apocalyptic more than the monsters and lack of resources
   does. Crawling from place to place feels effortful and sad, a contrast
   to the bustle of daily life that no longer exists for the characters.
   It makes the new world you find yourself in feel difficult, but also
   empty. There’s nothing to do anymore but survive, so you might as well
   take your time.

   This emptiness is emphasized by your companions, who lack faces or much
   personality. They’re described in small blurbs with descriptors like
   “kind of into this” or “doesn’t understand what the big deal is.” I
   felt attached to them the way you’d feel about a stranger waiting in a
   long post office line with you; I didn’t care about them in a specific
   sense, but I cared that they were there. Sometimes they’ll have
   backpacks, which let them carry more items, vital given your deeply
   limited inventory space. Other times they’ll have a positive or
   negative trait, like being able to throw things farther or making more
   noise when scavenging. Characters can be revived, but they’ll be
   injured, which results in limited actions per turn. Characters who were
   revived in their lives and described in a run’s final roundup as
   “ghosts,” lending a supernatural air to things.

   In one playthrough, my companions were two dogs. In a final standoff,
   my human character fell, followed by one of the dogs. Though the last
   dog stood no chance, he bravely killed several monsters before
   succumbing to the horde that surrounded him. It was, like many survival
   games, a small, doomed story that nevertheless felt grand in the
   moment, a whole life lived a world that just carried on through a new
   run.

   The shoebox levels add to this sense of drama played out against a
   bigger, uncaring world. They’re chunks of landscape floating in space,
   similar to the visual layout of Into the Breach. This design makes
   areas feel isolated while also suggesting a whole world just beyond
   their borders. Levels can sometimes be hard to parse, especially if
   they’re dark, though you can zoom in and move the camera a bit. I
   surprised myself by taking advantage of the game’s photo mode (I tend
   to hate photo modes) to zoom in and capture dramatic tableaux, as well
   as to explore a level a little more fully. Sometimes you can push and
   pull objects that you come across, or dump gasoline and then set things
   on fire, but by and large you can’t alter the layout you’ve been given.
   Objects like dumpsters and traffic barriers are familiar to everyday
   life, but their placement and limited interactivity in this game makes
   them feel imposing.

   I’ve only played a couple of hours of Overland, but I’m excited to
   explore the game more. Judging from the menu, there are seven areas to
   pass through; you can start from new ones if you unlock them by
   clearing the road of debris at the end of each section. I’m currently
   making my way through the Woodlands, the second level, which has an
   autumnal color palate and bigger monsters than the starting East Coast
   area. I don’t know what else awaits me on the road, though my map has
   hinted at traders who might want the potted plants and books I’ve clung
   to. I’m curious to see what they’ll give me in exchange.

Gothic Platformer Offers Brutal Combat With A Side Of Religious Trauma

   With A Side Of Religious Trauma
   Screenshot: The Game Kitchen

   Blasphemous, the indie platformer that Spanish studio The Game Kitchen
   crowd-funded two years ago, is now available on every major gaming
   platform. While I wasn’t one of the Kickstarter backers, I have been
   looking forward to this release for some time, both as a fan of
   difficult Souls-like games and someone who has long had a complicated
   relationship with religion. Blasphemous delivers on both, providing a
   substantial challenge and bringing out some unexpectedly powerful
   feelings in me about my own religious upbringing.

   I was raised as a Seventh-day Adventist, which most people don’t know
   much about other than possibly having heard of the Waco siege.
   Essentially, Seventh-day Adventism is Christianity with a couple of key
   differences, the most prominent of which is observing the sabbath on
   Saturday rather than Sunday. My family joined the church when I was in
   fifth grade, and I was moved from a traditional Christian school to one
   run by the Adventist church around that time.

   Like some Christian sects, Seventh-day Adventists have an almost
   paranoid obsession with the end times, or the period of time near the
   end of the world when the Antichrist will usher in the second coming of
   Jesus Christ. Where Adventists differ from most other sects, however,
   is that they believe there will be no Rapture, which is the phenomenon
   whereby the Christian god calls believers to heaven and leaves the rest
   of the world to deal with cataclysmic disasters and plagues. Adventists
   also believe that the Pope will reveal himself to be the Antichrist. As
   such, Catholicism is regarded by Adventists not as the Christian
   theology that it is but a wolf in sheep’s clothing, biding its time to
   seize control of the world.

   To get back to the first point in this explanation: no, the folks in
   Waco didn’t belong to the larger Seventh-day Adventist church, but
   rather, an offshoot. Still, it’s easy for me to see how a more extreme
   and cult-like version of Adventism could have emerged after I spent my
   formative years being indoctrinated into its core beliefs.

   Blasphemous is set in Cvstodia, an imagined empire of ritualistic
   adherence to fanatical religious tenets that draws very clear
   inspiration from the Catholic church. (Correction: 9/10/2019, 8:00 pm
   ET:.This story originally referred to the world as Orthodoxia, which
   was changed before release). The player character, known as the
   Penitent One, wears a large, pointed helmet reminiscent of the hoods
   worn by Catholic inquisitors in Spain and Portugal. Basic enemies
   consist of self-flagellating believers and bell-wielding nuns, and the
   architecture resembles the sharp steeples of places of worship from old
   Europe. Everywhere the player turns, statues honor unnamed saints, with
   frozen faces looking to the skies in supplication and stone arms
   reaching for heavenly salvation.

   But something is very wrong in Cvstodia. Religion has twisted and
   distorted the world, leaving behind a wasteland, albeit one that’s more
   Bloodborne than Mad Max. It’s clear that this apocalypse has had a
   devastating effect on the populace, many of whom now huddle for shelter
   in the ruins of temples that offer more tangible protection than
   religious teachings ever could. Every item the player collects in
   Blasphemous—from ability-enhancing rosary beads to bones of notable
   dead—is a testament to this lost era of history, detailing an
   excruciating past that saw the world collapse under the weight of its
   dogmatic hubris. Cvstodia is some of my worst childhood nightmares come
   to life, and my mind was flooded with these memories as soon as I
   stepped into the well-worn boots of the Penitent One.

   As a kid, I had a morbid fascination with the Catholic church. I would
   spend weekends anxiously poring through the histories of the
   inquisitions it inflicted on non-believers, starting in Europe and then
   carrying over to the Western hemisphere, with some of the most
   disgusting atrocities perpetrated against the native populations of
   North and South America. Having been told that the Catholic church
   would hand out similar punishment to Adventists once they took power
   behind the Antichrist, I became an emotional wreck over this as a
   child. Adventists do not believe in the rapture, and thus there would
   be no escape for me. How would I deal with being tortured on the rack?
   Would I feel anything before my head was guillotined from my neck?
   These aren’t the kinds of questions a pre-teen should have to deal
   with, but these images kept rattling around in my young mind.

   In my few hours with Blasphemous, the same sick feeling of fearful
   fascination has risen in my stomach, kept a bay only by the “must win”
   mentality with which I’ve been self-indoctrinated over decades of
   playing video games. Fortunately, the game-y aspects of Blasphemous are
   very good, providing a rewarding counterpoint to the unnerving memories
   that the setting happens to bring out in me. Traversing the crumbling
   landscape gives way to satisfying dodge- and parry-based combat and
   imaginative shortcuts that impart the same feeling of accomplishment as
   similar moments in games like Dark Souls. I’m constantly teetering
   somewhere between wanting to see the next area’s horrifying enemies and
   atmosphere and worried I’ll be struck down before finding the next
   health-restoring save point. The lore, which is told mostly through
   item descriptions, can be too on-the-nose and dark for the sake of
   being dark at times, but the way it folds together real religious
   iconography and the fantastic elements of Cvstodia has largely been
   just as clever as the combat.

   Advertisement

   It’s hard for me to evaluate Blasphemous as a whole, and not just
   because I haven’t beaten it yet. Do I truly enjoy this experience, or
   does it just ping the same compulsive receptors in my mind that made me
   obsessively stare at a computer screen and scare myself with possible
   futures of torture and execution in my youth? Cvstodia’s devastated
   landscape resembles my current relationship with more extreme Christian
   religions, its few, fearful adherents still giving thanks through
   prayer yet eyeing the skies in fear of the next bloody horror to come
   screeching down upon them. Blasphemous has reminded me that I am still
   dealing with the sticky residue of indoctrination all these years
   later, but there’s something about it that feels familiar and perhaps
   even comforting in some strange way.

Borderlands 3 Players Are Disappointed In Zane's Late-Game Weakness

   Joshua Rivera
   Today 1:00pm
   Filed to:Borderlands 3

   Some Borderlands 3 players believe that one member of the game’s roster
   of four playable characters is a bit of a lemon. It turns out that
   Zane, the Operative, is kind of a lousy performer when it comes to
   surviving Borderlands 3’s toughest post-game challenges. These problems
   don’t become clear until you reach the endgame, and by then, it’s
   already too late.

   Nearly two weeks after Borderlands 3 was released, many players are
   deep into the endgame, and some of them have been a bit frustrated by
   Zane’s high-level play. While he’s far from unuseable, his shortcomings
   have already become a bit of a meme, with players posting at length
   about how he seems to stack up poorly compared to the other three Vault
   Hunters. Granted, the game is two weeks old, and not everything is
   going to be perfectly balanced to everyone’s satisfaction. Still, Zane
   is an interesting case.

   A lot of what players say makes Zane a subpar choice in the endgame
   are, unfortunately, the same things that make him so interesting in an
   initial playthrough. He’s the only character who can equip two action
   skills at once, and each of the three skills he can choose from seem
   pretty useful, at least in the first go-round. There’s a barrier he can
   deploy for cover (that can be upgraded to become a dome and buff
   allies), a drone, and a Digi-Clone decoy that fires at enemies and can
   also switch places with Zane at the press of a button.

   This assortment of skills makes Zane a good choice for a
   tactically-minded player. The problem is that Borderlands 3 isn’t much
   of tactically-minded game, and the other three characters have an
   assortment of skills more inclined to dealing a lot of damage in very
   little time. This means Zane is both an oddball better suited for an
   entirely different game and, long-term, a liability with no real
   power-play to deal heavy damage to a boss or save their teammates from
   a mob of enemies.

   Intrepid Borderlands 3 players are finding ways to make Zane work
   despite his skillset. YouTuber RyanCentral has a great build that
   emphasizes speed and kills, one that Forbes’ Paul Tassi has also
   replicated with success. There are also build guides on
   RockPaperShotgun that take advantage of the character’s versatility.
   Zane isn’t a lost cause.

   The problem is that other characters have builds that are so good it
   feels like cheating, which is the platonic ideal of a Borderlands
   character. Right now, one of the most popular builds in the game
   centers on FL4K, the robot beastmaster, and exploiting their skill
   trees’ various ways to multiply the amount of critical damage dealt.
   Seeing it in action is truly insane.

   Borderlands 3 does not make it that easy to change characters. You’re
   pretty much locked into your choice for the additional modes following
   the main campaign, which are new game plus (dubbed True Vault Hunter
   Mode) or Mayhem mode, the latter of which offers three tiers of
   increased difficulty for running bosses and sidequests post-game. You
   could start up another character in True Vault Hunter Mode and level
   them faster with the increased rewards doled out, but you’re still
   starting from level 1. Also, starting a True Vault Hunter run with
   whatever character you beat the campaign with lets you skip the slow
   tutorial mission while letting you keep your skills, gear, and current
   level. So why can’t I just roll a new level 30 character for my second
   playthrough? (This is the same thing previous Borderlands games did;
   it’s just too bad that the latest installment hasn’t improved on this.)

   As someone who chose Zane as my main, I’m feeling a little burned. I’m
   pretty interested in the the game’s wealth of endgame content and
   extensive post-release plans. Tonal issues aside, it’s nice to play a
   loot shooter that feels like it’s completely busted in your favor.
   Playing as Zane doesn’t seem like it’s going to give me that
   experience, though. I’m not leveled high enough to have anything close
   to a good endgame build for him yet, but I’m already starting to feel
   the pinch. Zane just isn’t good at surviving, or dealing enough
   high-impact damage to make boss fights feel like less of a grueling
   experience. I want to feel like a superhero, but mostly I feel like a
   chump.

   Here’s hoping Borderlands 3 gets something akin to Diablo 3’s Adventure
   Mode, where you can just roll a character and run whatever challenges
   you want. In the meantime, I guess I’ll try my hand at playing as
   Amara, all the way back at level 1.
