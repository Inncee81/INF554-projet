    Global Climate Change Concerns for Africa’s Lake Victoria
       Global climate change could cause Africa’s Lake Victoria, the
       world’s largest tropical lake and source of the Nile River, to dry
       up in the next 500 years, according to new findings from a team of
       researchers led by the University of Houston. Even more imminent,
       the White Nile — one of the two main tributaries of the Nile —
       could lose its source waters in just a decade.
     * Discovery: New Biomarker for Cancer Stem Cells
    Discovery: New Biomarker for Cancer Stem Cells
       A University of Houston College of Pharmacy associate professor has
       discovered a new biomarker in cancer stem cells that govern cancer
       survival and spread, and it’s raising hope that drug discovery to
       kill cancer stem cells could follow suit.
     * New Catalyst Efficiently Produces Hydrogen from Seawater
    New Catalyst Efficiently Produces Hydrogen from Seawater
       Seawater is one of the most abundant resources on earth, offering
       promise both as a source of hydrogen – desirable as a source of
       clean energy – and of drinking water in arid climates. Now
       researchers from the University of Houston have reported a
       significant breakthrough in splitting seawater to produce hydrogen.

       Houston Starship Autonomous Food Delivery Robots Deployed at
       University of Houston
       A fleet of 30 Starship autonomous delivery robots has been deployed
       at the University of Houston, home to over 53,000 students, faculty
       and staff. In partnership with Chartwells Higher Education, UH is
       the first institution of higher education in the state of Texas to
       offer robotic food deliveries on campus.
     * Debunking Common Misperceptions of Asian Community Health
    Debunking Common Misperceptions of Asian Community Health
       Asian Americans have higher or faster-growing rates of cancer of
       various kinds than any other ethnic group, yet often don’t receive
       the necessary medical treatment. Common misperceptions about Asian
       health issues contribute to a lack of health awareness and a
       reluctance to seek care, according to research published in Public
       Relations Review.
     * Hospital Disinfectants Struggling to Kill Superbug Bacteria
       Hospital Disinfectants Struggling to Kill Superbug Bacteria
       The deadly superbug, Clostridioides difficile (C. diff), is putting
       up a winning fight against hospital-grade disinfectants meant to
       kill it, reports UH pharmacy professor Kevin Garey in a study that
       helps explain why C. diff is so hard to eradicate. The survival of
       C. diff in hospitals and nursing homes is especially hazardous –
       within one month of diagnosis, one in 11 people over age 65 died of
       a health care-associated C. diff infection.
     * Childhood Chores Not Related to Self-Control Development
    Childhood Chores Not Related to Self-Control Development
       A University of Houston psychologist is reporting that although
       assigning household chores is considered an essential component of
       child-rearing, it turns out they might not help improve children’s
       self-control. Assistant professor of psychology, Rodica Damian,
       also found that self-control predicted better work outcomes in
       young adulthood.
     * Exploring a Promising Therapeutic Approach for Ischemic Stroke
    Exploring a Promising Therapeutic Approach for Ischemic Stroke
       The blood brain barrier that protects the brain also blocks
       necessary medicine from entering to repair it after an injury like
       a stroke. In a new approach, a University of Houston associate
       pharmacy professor is targeting endothelial cells that make up the
       blood-brain barrier to repair them and carry much-needed medicine
       to neurons that are injured or dying after an ischemic stroke.

       System” honors the magnitude and diversity of the nearly 700-piece
       collection and highlights 40 of the most notable works. The book
       also features 30 essays by accomplished artists, scholars and
       curators.

    Blockchain Offers Promise for Securing Global Supply Chain
       Blockchain technology has the potential to transform the global
       supply chain and improve both the speed and security of handling
       the flow of goods at international borders. But researchers say big
       questions remain about how the transformation will unfold.

    New AI Deep Learning Model Allows Earlier, More Accurate Ozone
       Warnings
       Researchers from the University of Houston have developed an
       artificial intelligence-based ozone forecasting system, which would
       allow local areas to predict ozone levels 24 hours in advance.

       End UH Obesity and Diabetes Program Reports Success in Houston’s
       East End
       Obesity generates medical costs of $190 billion a year, and Texas
       has the 11th highest rate of obesity in the United States. In
       Houston’s East End, the University of Houston’s Project TOUCH is
       working to combat obesity and introduce healthy lifestyle choices.
       After a year the project has meaningful numbers to report and
       interesting people to meet.
