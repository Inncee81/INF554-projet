   The PHIDIAS kick-off meeting took place at the CINES premises in
   Montpellier (France) on 24th and 25th September 2019.

   This meeting had several goals, among them:
     * sharing and setting-up the management structure and procedure of
       the project,
     * drafting an action plan for the first year of the project,
     * discussing scientific and technical challenges of the project and,
     * meeting each others in person.

   40 people have participated to the Kick-Off Meeting. They were from
   Finland, Italy, Netherland, Belgium and France. The 13  members
   organizations had the opportunity to present and explain their role in
   PHIDIAS for the next 3 years.



   Each of the 7 workpackages were presented by the WP leader: WP1:
   Management & Overall Coordination; WP2: Computer and storage workflow
   management; WP3: Technical coordination and Development of the Common
   System that can handle the full « Earth System » perimeter; WP4: Data
   area test case 1 – Intelligent screening of large amount of satellite
   data for detection and identification of anomalous atmospheric
   composition events; WP5: Data area test case 2 – Big data earth
   observations: processing on-demand services for environmental
   monitoring: WP6: Data area test case 3 – Ocean; WP7: Dissemination,
   Impact and Sustainability path.



   On the second day, the participants brainstormed in 2 separate groups
   in order to initiate the scientific and technical reflections and to
   start the working tracks: Group 1: inputs / outputs needs? – Group 2:
   HPC / HPDA / storage needs? During the afternoon, the workpackages
   collected and listed the next actions to be implemented in the weeks /
   months / and year to come.

Kick-off meeting PHIDIAS


   The PHIDIAS kick-off meeting took place at the CINES premises in
   Montpellier (France) on 24th and 25th September 2019.

   This meeting had several goals, among them:
     * sharing and setting-up the management structure and procedure of
       the project,
     * drafting an action plan for the first year of the project,
     * discussing scientific and technical challenges of the project and,
     * meeting each others in person.

   40 people have participated to the Kick-Off Meeting. They were from
   Finland, Italy, Netherland, Belgium and France. The 13  members
   organizations had the opportunity to present and explain their role in
   PHIDIAS for the next 3 years.



   Each of the 7 workpackages were presented by the WP leader: WP1:
   Management & Overall Coordination; WP2: Computer and storage workflow
   management; WP3: Technical coordination and Development of the Common
   System that can handle the full « Earth System » perimeter; WP4: Data
   area test case 1 – Intelligent screening of large amount of satellite
   data for detection and identification of anomalous atmospheric
   composition events; WP5: Data area test case 2 – Big data earth
   observations: processing on-demand services for environmental
   monitoring: WP6: Data area test case 3 – Ocean; WP7: Dissemination,
   Impact and Sustainability path.



   On the second day, the participants brainstormed in 2 separate groups
   in order to initiate the scientific and technical reflections and to
   start the working tracks: Group 1: inputs / outputs needs? – Group 2:
   HPC / HPDA / storage needs? During the afternoon, the workpackages
   collected and listed the next actions to be implemented in the weeks /
   months / and year to come.

   You can follow the steps and actions of PHIDIAS via the website
   dedicated to the project: https://www.phidias-hpc.eu/
