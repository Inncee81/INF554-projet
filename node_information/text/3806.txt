US-EU trade fight could drag on after 'big victory' at the WTO, says ex-Trump
official

     * The World Trade Organization ruled in favor of the U.S. imposing
       tariffs on the European Union.
     * "At the end of the day, what they'd like to do is use these tariffs
       for leverage to get a negotiated outcome," said Clete Willems,
       former National Economic Council deputy director.
     * But the U.S. and the EU have not achieved much in their past trade
       negotiations, so those tariffs could stay in place for many months,
       said Willems.

   Squawk Box Asia

   The World Trade Organization has just authorized the U.S. to go ahead
   with its tariffs worth billions of dollars on the European Union —
   that's "a big deal" that would hopefully bring both sides to the
   negotiating table, said a former high-ranking trade official under
   President Donald Trump.

   But Washington and Brussels have not achieved much in their past trade
   negotiations, so the U.S. tariffs on $7.5 billion of European goods
   could stay in place for many months, said Clete Willems, who was deputy
   director of the National Economic Council, told CNBC's "Squawk Box
   Asia" on Thursday.

   "It's a big deal: $7.5 billion is the largest retaliation number that
   the WTO has ever authorized. So, it's a big victory for the United
   States," said Willems, who's now a partner at law firm Akin Gump after
   leaving his White House position in April.
   ... you are going to see these tariffs in place for some period of
   months.
   Clete Willems
   former deputy director at the National Economic Council

   "At the end of the day, what they'd like to do is use these tariffs for
   leverage to get a negotiated outcome," he said. "But I do think that
   the two sides haven't worked together particularly well when it comes
   to trade negotiations lately and it may take some time for them to work
   through these issues ... so you are going to see these tariffs in place
   for some period of months."

   The WTO outcome on Wednesday came after years of wrangling over
   subsidies that aircraft maker Airbus received from several European
   governments. The U.S. first lodged the complaints in 2004.

   In response to the WTO ruling, the EU suggested it would retaliate
   against U.S. tariffs.

   Closing Bell

   The U.S. and the EU have been at odds over trade issues, especially
   since Trump took office in 2017. Both sides have been trying to
   negotiate a trade deal but have not appeared to make much progress.

   A potential escalation in trade friction between the two sides comes at
   a time when the U.S. is facing off against China in a tariff fight that
   has dampened business sentiment and threatened economic growth
   globally.

   Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank, wrote
   in a Thursday note that it's hard not to see the timing and context of
   the WTO ruling as "tragic." He said the decision could steer global
   trade "even more off-course."

   "But the blow is not just to trade as corporate margins erode,
   household discretionary income is diminished, shipping suffers air
   pockets and financial repression is prolonged," he said.

Climate protesters spray 1,800 liters of 'fake blood' over UK Treasury
building

     * Extinction rebellion activists have targeted the U.K. Treasury
       building in London.
     * Protesters say the U.K. is hypocritical to fund fossil fuel
       discoveries while claiming it is tackling climate change.

   LONDON - Climate change activist group Extinction Rebellion has used a
   fire engine to spray fake blood over the steps and entrance to the U.K.
   Treasury building in Westminster, London.

   The group live-streamed the event on Facebook, which showed police
   officers now guarding the entrance. The organization also posted an
   image on Twitter which shows the fire engine covered in part with a
   banner that read "Stop funding climate death."

   The group's website said 1,800 liters of fake blood had been sprayed.
   It added that the 'blood' is made from water colored with food dye that
   can be washed off the building.

   It added that the protest is being held to "highlight the inconsistency
   between the U.K. Government's insistence that the U.K. is a world
   leader in tackling climate breakdown, while pouring vast sums of money
   into fossil exploration and carbon-intensive projects"

   Speaking on U.K. radio on Thursday, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said he
   had sympathy over the right to protests and that the world did face a
   climate emergency.

   Khan warned, however, that police resources to contain public disorder
   was strained and that anyone who wanted to protest "must do it lawfully
   and peacefully."

   On October 7, the Extinction Rebellion group is calling on people to
   participate in a fresh set of protests across 60 cities around the
   world. It says in London the group plans to block 12 areas around
   Westminster.

Scottish whisky to be 'hit hard' by US tariffs after EU Airbus ruling

   Published Thu, Oct 3 20197:37 AM EDTUpdated Thu, Oct 3 20198:09 AM EDT
   David Reid@davyreid73
   Key Points
     * The U.S. plans to impose a 25% tariff on Scottish whisky imports as
       well as other  EU goods including aircraft and agricultural
       products.
     * The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative decision follows a WTO
       ruling related to subsidies that helped to develop Airbus planes.
     * The WTO said U.S. plane makers, essentially Boeing, had been
       unfairly impacted by the subsidies from some EU governments.

   The Scottish Whisky Association has said the planned U.S. tariffs on
   the spirit drink is disproportionate and will "undoubtedly damage"
   sales.

   The U.S. has announced it will bring in a tariff of 25% on imports of
   single malt Scotch whisky and liqueurs from the U.K. The move follows a
   World Trade Organization (WTO) ruling that says the U.S. is entitled to
   recoup almost $7.5 billion dollars a year via tariffs on EU imports.

   The WTO decision was related to the accusation that several EU
   governments granted illegal subsidies to the plane maker Airbus as it
   looked to develop and sell planes. The WTO said the move had negatively
   impacted sales of U.S. made planes in the large and very large aircraft
   market.

   "The tariff will undoubtedly damage the Scotch Whisky sector. The U.S.
   is our largest and most valuable single market, and over £1 billion of
   Scotch Whisky was exported there last year," said Scottish Whisky
   Association chief executive Karen Betts, in a statement Thursday.

   Several items from different European countries are being targeted but
   Betts said Scottish Whisky had come out of the decision particularly
   badly and would amount to $460 million worth of tariffs annually.

   "Despite the fact that this dispute is about aircraft subsidies, our
   sector has been hit hard, with Single Malt Scotch Whisky representing
   over half of the total value of U.K. products on the U.S. Government
   tariff list."

   Blended whisky is exempt from tariffs, meaning that Diageo's popular
   Johnnie Walker brand is unaffected by U.S tariffs. Shares in Diageo,
   which also owns Smirnoff and Guinness, rose by nearly 1.5% in Thursday
   morning trade.

   The USTR released a list Wednesday of products it plans to target from
   Oct. 18 onwards. The duties include:
     * 10% tariffs on aircraft from France, Germany, Spain or the United
       Kingdom
     * 25% duties on single-malt Irish and Scotch whiskies, various
       garments and blankets from the U.K.
     * 25% tariffs on coffee and certain tools and machinery from Germany
     * 25% duties on various cheeses, olive oil and frozen meat from
       Germany, Spain and the U.K.
     * 25% tariffs on certain pork products, butter and yogurt from
       multiple countries

   In 2018, the U.S. imported about $488 billion in products from the EU
   while the U.S. sent about $319 billion in goods to EU countries.

   In its response to Wednesday's decision, the U.K. government Department
   of Trade and Industry said: "resorting to tariffs is not in the
   interests of the U.K., EU or U.S."

   The U.K. government also claimed that the U.K. "and other Airbus
   nations" had taken steps to bring support for the plane maker into
   compliance.

   It added that it had seen no effort by the United States to bring its
   support for Boeing into WTO compliance.

   The WTO is expected to offer its ruling on the EU's subsidy case
   against Boeing in 2020.

   CNBC's Jacob Pramuk and Kayla Tausche contributed to this report.

   President Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday that he said
   would improve private Medicare plans for seniors, slamming Democrats
   for what he described as putting health care "under threat" with
   "Medicare for All" proposals.

   Trump, speaking for an hour at a campaign-style rally at a retirement
   community in Florida, offered few details on his executive order and
   spent most of his speech attacking the health policies of 2020
   Democratic presidential contenders. He said as long as he's president,
   "no one will lay a hand on your Medicare benefits."

   "Medicare is under threat like never before," Trump told the crowd. "I
   will never allow these politicians to steal your health care and give
   it away to illegal aliens."
   VIDEO2:4302:43

   Closing Bell

   Shortly after Trump's speech, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex
   Azar said the president has "directed HHS to take a number of specific,
   significant steps that will meaningfully improve the financing of
   Medicare, advance the care American seniors receive from their doctors,
   and improve the health they enjoy."

   Azar said those steps including lowering costs in Medicare Advantage,
   allowing those beneficiaries to create savings accounts and
   accelerating access to the latest medical technologies after being
   approved by regulators.

   Earlier Thursday, senior administration officials said Trump was
   expected to issue an executive order making changes to the Medicare
   program to "protect" Americans from Democratic health-care proposals
   they said would "destroy" coverage for seniors.

   The executive order is intended to bolster Medicare Advantage, which is
   private Medicare insurance for seniors, the officials said on a call
   with reporters. The plan would also offer more affordable plan options,
   encourage wider use of telehealth services, promote wellness benefits
   and bring payments in Medicare fee-for-service program in line with
   payments for Medicare Advantage, officials said.

   Watch:

   Gerard Anderson, professor of health policy and management at Johns
   Hopkins University, said the administration's changes were incremental
   and it could have proposed more benefits like, "r offering dental and
   vision benefits which would bring Medicare up to private sector
   benefits."
   VIDEO8:2308:23
   Here's where the Democratic candidates stand on health care
   Elections

   Trump has made lowering health-care costs one of the key issues of his
   administration as health care remains a top issue for voters in the
   2020 elections.

   The executive order takes direct aim at 2020 Democratic candidates who
   advocate for changes to the U.S. health-care system through some
   version of Medicare for All.

   Arguably the most drastic proposal is from Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.,
   who is calling for eliminating private health insurance and replacing
   it with a universal Medicare plan. Proponents say it would help reduce
   administrative inefficiencies and costs in the U.S. health-care system.
   Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has backed Sanders' proposal.

   During the speech in Flordia, Trump described "Medicare for All" as a
   massive "government health-care takeover" that would "obliterate"
   coverage for seniors.

   "They want to raid Medicare to fund a thing like socialism," he said.
   "Today we're creating a health-care system that protects vulnerable
   patients."

   Spokespersons for Sanders' and Warren's campaigns did not respond to
   requests for comment.

US-EU trade fight could drag on after 'big victory' at the WTO, says ex-Trump

     * "At the end of the day, what they'd like to do is use these tariffs

   US tariffs on the EU will have 'significant economic impact'
   Squawk Box Asia

   The World Trade Organization has just authorized the U.S. to go ahead
   with its tariffs worth billions of dollars on the European Union —
   that's "a big deal" that would hopefully bring both sides to the
   negotiating table, said a former high-ranking trade official under
   President Donald Trump.

   But Washington and Brussels have not achieved much in their past trade
   negotiations, so the U.S. tariffs on $7.5 billion of European goods
   could stay in place for many months, said Clete Willems, who was deputy
   director of the National Economic Council, told CNBC's "Squawk Box
   Asia" on Thursday.

   "It's a big deal: $7.5 billion is the largest retaliation number that
   the WTO has ever authorized. So, it's a big victory for the United
   States," said Willems, who's now a partner at law firm Akin Gump after
   leaving his White House position in April.
   ... you are going to see these tariffs in place for some period of
   months.
   Clete Willems
   former deputy director at the National Economic Council

   "At the end of the day, what they'd like to do is use these tariffs for
   leverage to get a negotiated outcome," he said. "But I do think that
   the two sides haven't worked together particularly well when it comes
   to trade negotiations lately and it may take some time for them to work
   through these issues ... so you are going to see these tariffs in place
   for some period of months."

   The WTO outcome on Wednesday came after years of wrangling over
   subsidies that aircraft maker Airbus received from several European
   governments. The U.S. first lodged the complaints in 2004.

   In response to the WTO ruling, the EU suggested it would retaliate
   against U.S. tariffs.

   Closing Bell

   The U.S. and the EU have been at odds over trade issues, especially
   since Trump took office in 2017. Both sides have been trying to
   negotiate a trade deal but have not appeared to make much progress.

   A potential escalation in trade friction between the two sides comes at
   a time when the U.S. is facing off against China in a tariff fight that
   has dampened business sentiment and threatened economic growth
   globally.

   Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank, wrote
   in a Thursday note that it's hard not to see the timing and context of
   the WTO ruling as "tragic." He said the decision could steer global
   trade "even more off-course."

   "But the blow is not just to trade as corporate margins erode,
   household discretionary income is diminished, shipping suffers air
   pockets and financial repression is prolonged," he said.

Climate protesters spray 1,800 liters of 'fake blood' over UK Treasury
building

   Key Points
     * Extinction rebellion activists have targeted the U.K. Treasury
       building in London.
     * Protesters say the U.K. is hypocritical to fund fossil fuel
       discoveries while claiming it is tackling climate change.

   LONDON - Climate change activist group Extinction Rebellion has used a
   fire engine to spray fake blood over the steps and entrance to the U.K.
   Treasury building in Westminster, London.

   The group live-streamed the event on Facebook, which showed police
   officers now guarding the entrance. The organization also posted an
   image on Twitter which shows the fire engine covered in part with a
   banner that read "Stop funding climate death."

   The group's website said 1,800 liters of fake blood had been sprayed.
   It added that the 'blood' is made from water colored with food dye that
   can be washed off the building.

   It added that the protest is being held to "highlight the inconsistency
   between the U.K. Government's insistence that the U.K. is a world
   leader in tackling climate breakdown, while pouring vast sums of money
   into fossil exploration and carbon-intensive projects"

   Speaking on U.K. radio on Thursday, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said he
   had sympathy over the right to protests and that the world did face a
   climate emergency.

   Khan warned, however, that police resources to contain public disorder
   was strained and that anyone who wanted to protest "must do it lawfully
   and peacefully."

   On October 7, the Extinction Rebellion group is calling on people to
   participate in a fresh set of protests across 60 cities around the
   world. It says in London the group plans to block 12 areas around
   Westminster.

Scottish whisky to be 'hit hard' by US tariffs after EU Airbus ruling

   Published Thu, Oct 3 20197:37 AM EDTUpdated Thu, Oct 3 20198:09 AM EDT
   David Reid@davyreid73
   Key Points
     * The U.S. plans to impose a 25% tariff on Scottish whisky imports as
       well as other  EU goods including aircraft and agricultural
       products.
     * The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative decision follows a WTO
       ruling related to subsidies that helped to develop Airbus planes.
     * The WTO said U.S. plane makers, essentially Boeing, had been
       unfairly impacted by the subsidies from some EU governments.

   The Scottish Whisky Association has said the planned U.S. tariffs on
   the spirit drink is disproportionate and will "undoubtedly damage"
   sales.

   The U.S. has announced it will bring in a tariff of 25% on imports of
   single malt Scotch whisky and liqueurs from the U.K. The move follows a
   World Trade Organization (WTO) ruling that says the U.S. is entitled to
   recoup almost $7.5 billion dollars a year via tariffs on EU imports.

   The WTO decision was related to the accusation that several EU
   governments granted illegal subsidies to the plane maker Airbus as it
   looked to develop and sell planes. The WTO said the move had negatively
   impacted sales of U.S. made planes in the large and very large aircraft
   market.

   "The tariff will undoubtedly damage the Scotch Whisky sector. The U.S.
   is our largest and most valuable single market, and over £1 billion of
   Scotch Whisky was exported there last year," said Scottish Whisky
   Association chief executive Karen Betts, in a statement Thursday.

   Several items from different European countries are being targeted but
   Betts said Scottish Whisky had come out of the decision particularly
   badly and would amount to $460 million worth of tariffs annually.

   "Despite the fact that this dispute is about aircraft subsidies, our
   sector has been hit hard, with Single Malt Scotch Whisky representing
   over half of the total value of U.K. products on the U.S. Government
   tariff list."

   Blended whisky is exempt from tariffs, meaning that Diageo's popular
   Johnnie Walker brand is unaffected by U.S tariffs. Shares in Diageo,
   which also owns Smirnoff and Guinness, rose by nearly 1.5% in Thursday
   morning trade.

   The USTR released a list Wednesday of products it plans to target from
   Oct. 18 onwards. The duties include:
     * 10% tariffs on aircraft from France, Germany, Spain or the United
       Kingdom
     * 25% duties on single-malt Irish and Scotch whiskies, various
       garments and blankets from the U.K.
     * 25% tariffs on coffee and certain tools and machinery from Germany
     * 25% duties on various cheeses, olive oil and frozen meat from
       Germany, Spain and the U.K.
     * 25% tariffs on certain pork products, butter and yogurt from
       multiple countries

   In 2018, the U.S. imported about $488 billion in products from the EU
   while the U.S. sent about $319 billion in goods to EU countries.

   In its response to Wednesday's decision, the U.K. government Department
   of Trade and Industry said: "resorting to tariffs is not in the
   interests of the U.K., EU or U.S."

   The U.K. government also claimed that the U.K. "and other Airbus
   nations" had taken steps to bring support for the plane maker into
   compliance.

   It added that it had seen no effort by the United States to bring its
   support for Boeing into WTO compliance.

   The WTO is expected to offer its ruling on the EU's subsidy case
   against Boeing in 2020.

   CNBC's Jacob Pramuk and Kayla Tausche contributed to this report.

   President Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday that he said
   would improve private Medicare plans for seniors, slamming Democrats
   for what he described as putting health care "under threat" with
   "Medicare for All" proposals.

   Trump, speaking for an hour at a campaign-style rally at a retirement
   community in Florida, offered few details on his executive order and
   spent most of his speech attacking the health policies of 2020
   Democratic presidential contenders. He said as long as he's president,
   "no one will lay a hand on your Medicare benefits."

   "Medicare is under threat like never before," Trump told the crowd. "I
   will never allow these politicians to steal your health care and give
   it away to illegal aliens."

   Trump wouldn't be surprised if Big Pharma had role in impeachment probe
   Closing Bell

   Shortly after Trump's speech, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex
   Azar said the president has "directed HHS to take a number of specific,
   significant steps that will meaningfully improve the financing of
   Medicare, advance the care American seniors receive from their doctors,
   and improve the health they enjoy."

   Azar said those steps including lowering costs in Medicare Advantage,
   allowing those beneficiaries to create savings accounts and
   accelerating access to the latest medical technologies after being
   approved by regulators.

   Earlier Thursday, senior administration officials said Trump was
   expected to issue an executive order making changes to the Medicare
   program to "protect" Americans from Democratic health-care proposals
   they said would "destroy" coverage for seniors.

   The executive order is intended to bolster Medicare Advantage, which is
   private Medicare insurance for seniors, the officials said on a call
   with reporters. The plan would also offer more affordable plan options,
   encourage wider use of telehealth services, promote wellness benefits
   and bring payments in Medicare fee-for-service program in line with
   payments for Medicare Advantage, officials said.

   Watch:

   Gerard Anderson, professor of health policy and management at Johns
   Hopkins University, said the administration's changes were incremental
   and it could have proposed more benefits like, "r offering dental and
   vision benefits which would bring Medicare up to private sector
   benefits."
   VIDEO8:2308:23
   Here's where the Democratic candidates stand on health care
   Elections

   Trump has made lowering health-care costs one of the key issues of his
   administration as health care remains a top issue for voters in the
   2020 elections.

   The executive order takes direct aim at 2020 Democratic candidates who
   advocate for changes to the U.S. health-care system through some
   version of Medicare for All.

   Arguably the most drastic proposal is from Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.,
   who is calling for eliminating private health insurance and replacing
   it with a universal Medicare plan. Proponents say it would help reduce
   administrative inefficiencies and costs in the U.S. health-care system.
   Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has backed Sanders' proposal.

   During the speech in Flordia, Trump described "Medicare for All" as a
   massive "government health-care takeover" that would "obliterate"
   coverage for seniors.

   "They want to raid Medicare to fund a thing like socialism," he said.
   "Today we're creating a health-care system that protects vulnerable
   patients."

   Spokespersons for Sanders' and Warren's campaigns did not respond to
   requests for comment.
