   5.0 out of 5 starsBest under eye cream!
   March 5, 2017
   Verified Purchase
   Amazing product! What a difference 12 days made. I'm an absolute fan I
   will reorder again! It got to a point that under my eyes makeup no
   longer looked good. Now after 12 days and using the eye cream twice a
   day the results are fantastic! Both pictures are with makeup, but now
   my makeup glides smooth. I use Aragon oil underneath and wait 5 minutes
   before concealer.

     ✅PACKS OF 7 SILICONE SPONGE - purple, red, green, light blue, pink,
   yellow and orange

     ✅HIGH QUALITY FDA APPROVED - Silicone sponge with thick and soft
   bristle. No need to worry about leaving scratches to tableware anymore.
   It is easy to reach the corner of the cups and glasses. It’s simply the
   best sponge to clean dishes, pans, glasses, fruits and vegetables.
   NOTE: DESIGNED FOR LIGHT WASH

     ✅EASY TO CLEAN, EASY TO WASH - Antibacterial Dish Washing Sponges can
   be easily rinsed with water and wash machine. Or put them in the dish
   washer and hang them with the hook to dry them out. And yes! They are
   dish washer safe! And yes! They can be boiled due to high heat
   resistance!

     ✅MADE OF FOOD-GRADE, BPA FREE, ANTIBACTERIAL SILICONE - They do not
   absorb water nor are they porous which discourages any bacterial growth
   or unpleasant odor. They are antibacterial and totally free from
   chemical material. It’s time to say goodbye to traditional dish
   scrubber and replace them with silicone sponge. Bye-bye old dish
   scrubber

     ✅MULTIPLE FUNCTION – they are often used as hot pot holder, silicone
   coaster since they are heat resistant silicone (-60℃ to 230℃ / -76℉ to
   500℉). Not only that, they can also be used in the shower! Yup, even
   better.

How to use

   They do not absorb the soap nor water. So put some soap into a
   container and fill it out with hot water. And then wash the dishes from
   there with the silicone dishwashing scrubber

   Since they don’t have much scrubbing power (100% made of silicone),
   They are good for light wash. Ideally do the dishwashing soon after the
   usage or soak the dishes for a bit and then wash

   5.0 out of 5 starsExcellent bacteria free way to scrub
   February 5, 2019
   Verified Purchase
   Excellent and just as described. These will not absorb any water and
   therefore they don’t act like a sponge. These you can use safely scrub
   grime off counters, dishes, tables but again no crumbs will stick to
   them and water won’t absorb. By far, the best part about this product
   is that you are not having a breeding ground in your kitchen for
   bacteria using a sponge. Once you use these you will not go back.!

   March 27, 2019
   Verified Purchase
   I absolutely love these to use instead of a sponge I hate the way a
   sponge looks like 2 days after you use it also they smell. So I was
   always sticking it in the microwave or tossing them. Gets pricey. Well
   these are awesome. They come in different colors so I can use them for
   different places bathroom, also used on laundry stains after I pretreat
   try it works great. If I was going to change one thing maybe one with a
   little stiffer for when your kids or husband cooks and burns a bit.

   4.0 out of 5 starsYou decide - trade off clean/sanitary for sponge
   capability
   July 3, 2019
   Verified Purchase
   I really wanted to love these, and I’m halfway there. I at least
   recommend that you try them, but I couldn’t give them 5 stars.
   The do solve the primary problem with regular sponges: they do not get
   mildewy and you can put them in the dishwasher and they get completely
   100% clean and dry. Love it for that.
   However, they fall short of traditional sponges in a couple areas. They
   don’t suds very well, so I ended up using way more soap than I usually
   do. And they don’t scrape. Despite being “pointy”, silicone is a smooth
   surface at the microscopic level, and the silicone is flexible. So they
   have literally no scraping capability whatsoever. Even less than a
   “regular” sponge. These can serve as an accompaniment to some other
   scraper or Scotch pad, but as the sole dish-cleaning instrument, they
   will fall short.

   5.0 out of 5 starsMissing a Great Marketing Opportunity
   July 13, 2019
   Verified Purchase
   I fabricated my own kitchen counter tops from solid oak boards and put
   polyurethane on the surfaces. My guests and are very cautious not to
   abuse the counter tops. My roommate brought one of these kitchen
   sponges home that she bought from a local retailer. We've never used
   them as kitchen sponges but rather coasters. I liked hers so much I
   bought this set of sponges.
   There are 4-6 cups/tumblers/cans on the countertops at any given time.
   These sponges work great as coasters and add a little color to the
   kitchen. However, if you have a glass that sweats these aren't the best
   coaster since they will not absorb water and will have to be drained
   occasionally which can be messy.

   4.0 out of 5 starsGreat Alternative Sponge
   August 18, 2019
   Verified Purchase
   Pros: Clean it in the dishwasher, reaches hard to reach spots because
   it’s flexible, can get sticky food like eggs and cheese off without
   getting food globs stuck which ruin a normal sponge.
   Cons: A little slippery, doesn’t hold soap well, can’t be used to
   absorb anything, sometimes ineffective for getting tougher / dried food
   off dishes
   Overall - I really love tris sponge as an additional tool in my
   kitchen. Rarely will I use it on all my dishes but it has made me use a
   traditional sponge less often. The reason I really love this sponge
   though is because my son has multiple allergies and I can use this as a
   dedicated sponge for his dishes or I can use it when I have to tackle
   something that has a high allergen for him and limit the likelihood of
   contaminating things like his drink cup or water bottle. The only
   disappointment is I’ve heard people say they use them to wipe
   countertops or tables but I can’t see how that would work since they
   don’t absorb liquid and would leave puddles around your counters.

   4.0 out of 5 starsThey are easy to wash out, nothing sticks to them!
   May 10, 2019
   Verified Purchase
   Theses are handy, sturdy and efficient cleaning scrubs for dishes, pots
   & pans and even utensils. What I really dig about them is that nothing
   sticks to them after use, just add a drop or two of soap & wash out w/
   running water and they're ready for next use. The only issue I had was
   where to store it till next time, so I just let it drain on my dish
   rack tray and it's handy to reach when I need it. I'd recommend this
   product. In fact, the package came with quite a few so am tucking some
   away for stocking stuffers.

   I like the idea that they're cleanable. Sponges aren't very cleanable.
   So I toss them often. The alternative silicone has appeal in that
   department. But, these new, soft sponges don't get things clean as
   well. I'll keep trying. But, I find myself reaching for my regular
   sponge with its scrubbing side.

   These are good for scraping dishes before the dishwasher. I love that
   you can run them through the dishwasher to clean them. Easy to handle,
   as they are a small size that fits well in the hand. They are gentler
   than other cleaning tools on the pans. I am very happy with this
   purchase.

   5.0 out of 5 starsBest under eye cream!
   March 5, 2017
   Verified Purchase
   Amazing product! What a difference 12 days made. I'm an absolute fan I
   will reorder again! It got to a point that under my eyes makeup no
   longer looked good. Now after 12 days and using the eye cream twice a
   day the results are fantastic! Both pictures are with makeup, but now
   my makeup glides smooth. I use Aragon oil underneath and wait 5 minutes
   before concealer.

How to use

   They do not absorb the soap nor water. So put some soap into a
   container and fill it out with hot water. And then wash the dishes from
   there with the silicone dishwashing scrubber

   Since they don’t have much scrubbing power (100% made of silicone),
   They are good for light wash. Ideally do the dishwashing soon after the
   usage or soak the dishes for a bit and then wash

   5.0 out of 5 starsExcellent bacteria free way to scrub
   February 5, 2019
   Verified Purchase
   Excellent and just as described. These will not absorb any water and
   therefore they don’t act like a sponge. These you can use safely scrub
   grime off counters, dishes, tables but again no crumbs will stick to
   them and water won’t absorb. By far, the best part about this product
   is that you are not having a breeding ground in your kitchen for
   bacteria using a sponge. Once you use these you will not go back.!

   5.0 out of 5 starsLove these
   March 27, 2019
   Verified Purchase
   I absolutely love these to use instead of a sponge I hate the way a
   sponge looks like 2 days after you use it also they smell. So I was
   always sticking it in the microwave or tossing them. Gets pricey. Well
   these are awesome. They come in different colors so I can use them for
   different places bathroom, also used on laundry stains after I pretreat
   try it works great. If I was going to change one thing maybe one with a
   little stiffer for when your kids or husband cooks and burns a bit.

   4.0 out of 5 starsYou decide - trade off clean/sanitary for sponge
   capability
   July 3, 2019
   Verified Purchase
   I really wanted to love these, and I’m halfway there. I at least
   recommend that you try them, but I couldn’t give them 5 stars.
   The do solve the primary problem with regular sponges: they do not get
   mildewy and you can put them in the dishwasher and they get completely
   100% clean and dry. Love it for that.
   However, they fall short of traditional sponges in a couple areas. They
   don’t suds very well, so I ended up using way more soap than I usually
   do. And they don’t scrape. Despite being “pointy”, silicone is a smooth
   surface at the microscopic level, and the silicone is flexible. So they
   have literally no scraping capability whatsoever. Even less than a
   “regular” sponge. These can serve as an accompaniment to some other
   scraper or Scotch pad, but as the sole dish-cleaning instrument, they
   will fall short.

   5.0 out of 5 starsMissing a Great Marketing Opportunity
   July 13, 2019
   Verified Purchase
   I fabricated my own kitchen counter tops from solid oak boards and put
   polyurethane on the surfaces. My guests and are very cautious not to
   abuse the counter tops. My roommate brought one of these kitchen
   sponges home that she bought from a local retailer. We've never used
   them as kitchen sponges but rather coasters. I liked hers so much I
   bought this set of sponges.
   There are 4-6 cups/tumblers/cans on the countertops at any given time.
   These sponges work great as coasters and add a little color to the
   kitchen. However, if you have a glass that sweats these aren't the best
   coaster since they will not absorb water and will have to be drained
   occasionally which can be messy.

   Pros: Clean it in the dishwasher, reaches hard to reach spots because
   it’s flexible, can get sticky food like eggs and cheese off without
   getting food globs stuck which ruin a normal sponge.
   Cons: A little slippery, doesn’t hold soap well, can’t be used to
   absorb anything, sometimes ineffective for getting tougher / dried food
   off dishes
   Overall - I really love tris sponge as an additional tool in my
   kitchen. Rarely will I use it on all my dishes but it has made me use a
   traditional sponge less often. The reason I really love this sponge
   though is because my son has multiple allergies and I can use this as a
   dedicated sponge for his dishes or I can use it when I have to tackle
   something that has a high allergen for him and limit the likelihood of
   contaminating things like his drink cup or water bottle. The only
   disappointment is I’ve heard people say they use them to wipe
   countertops or tables but I can’t see how that would work since they
   don’t absorb liquid and would leave puddles around your counters.

   Theses are handy, sturdy and efficient cleaning scrubs for dishes, pots
   & pans and even utensils. What I really dig about them is that nothing
   sticks to them after use, just add a drop or two of soap & wash out w/
   running water and they're ready for next use. The only issue I had was
   where to store it till next time, so I just let it drain on my dish
   rack tray and it's handy to reach when I need it. I'd recommend this
   product. In fact, the package came with quite a few so am tucking some
   away for stocking stuffers.

   I like the idea that they're cleanable. Sponges aren't very cleanable.
   So I toss them often. The alternative silicone has appeal in that
   department. But, these new, soft sponges don't get things clean as
   well. I'll keep trying. But, I find myself reaching for my regular
   sponge with its scrubbing side.

   These are good for scraping dishes before the dishwasher. I love that
   you can run them through the dishwasher to clean them. Easy to handle,
   as they are a small size that fits well in the hand. They are gentler
   than other cleaning tools on the pans. I am very happy with this
   purchase.
