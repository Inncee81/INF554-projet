WAIT… WHAT?

Trump’s ‘Missing DNC Server’ Is Neither Missing Nor a Server

   The president can spout conspiracy theories all he wants. But the DNC
   turned over all its key data to the FBI after it got hacked. And that
   info wasn’t stored on a single server.

   Donald Trump turns to right-wing conspiracy theories when he’s
   cornered, and he was cornered on Monday. Standing feet away from
   Vladimir Putin at a press conference following their Helsinki
   tete-a-tete, a reporter challenged Trump to condemn Putin for Russia’s
   election interference, “in front of the world.” Instead, the world
   watched as the president of the United States took Putin’s side against
   his own Justice Department and his own intelligence agencies, and
   launched into a rambling discourse about Hillary Clinton’s emails and a
   supposedly missing DNC server that hides the truth about Putin’s
   innocence.

   “You have groups that are wondering why the FBI never took the server.
   Why didn’t they take the server? Where is the server, I want to know,
   and what is the server saying?”

   The server is saying shut up.

   The “server” Trump is obsessed with is actually 140 servers, most of
   them cloud-based, which the DNC was forced to decommission in June 2016
   while trying to rid its network of the Russian GRU officers working to
   help Trump win the election, according to the figures in the DNC’s
   civil lawsuit against Russia and the Trump campaign. Another 180
   desktop and laptop computers were also swapped out as the DNC raced to
   get the organization back on its feet and free of Putin’s surveillance.

   But despite Trump’s repeated feverish claims to the contrary, no
   machines are actually missing.
   “Despite Trump’s repeated feverish claims to the contrary, no machines
   are actually missing.”

   It’s true that the FBI doesn’t have the DNC’s computer hardware. Agents
   didn’t sweep into DNC headquarters, load up all the equipment and leave
   Democrats standing stunned beside empty desks and dangling cables.
   There’s a reason for that, and it has nothing to do with a deep state
   conspiracy to frame Putin.

   Trump and his allies are capitalizing on a basic misapprehension of how
   computer intrusion investigations work. Investigating a virtual crime
   isn’t a like investigating a murder. The Russians didn’t leave DNA
   evidence on the server racks and fingerprints on the keyboards. All the
   evidence of their comings and goings was on the computer hard drives,
   and in memory, and in the ephemeral network transmissions to and from
   the GRU’s command-and-control servers.

   When cyber investigators respond to an incident, they capture that
   evidence in a process called “imaging.” They make an exact
   byte-for-byte copy of the hard drives. They do the same for the
   machine’s memory, capturing evidence that would otherwise be lost at
   the next reboot, and they monitor and store the traffic passing through
   the victim’s network. This has been standard procedure in computer
   intrusion investigations for decades. The images, not the computer’s
   hardware, provide the evidence.

   Both the DNC and the security firm Crowdstrike, hired to respond to the
   breach, have said repeatedly over the years that they gave the FBI a
   copy of all the DNC images back in 2016. The DNC reiterated that Monday
   in a statement to the Daily Beast.

   “The FBI was given images of servers, forensic copies, as well as a
   host of other forensic information we collected from our systems,” said
   Adrienne Watson, the DNC’s deputy communications director. “We were in
   close contact and worked cooperatively with the FBI and were always
   responsive to their requests. Any suggestion that they were denied
   access to what they wanted for their investigation is completely
   incorrect.”

   The FBI declined comment for this story, but in testimony before the
   House Intelligence Committee last year, then-director James Comey said
   that Crowdstrike “ultimately shared with us their forensics.”

   At that same hearing, Comey complained that the DNC didn’t give the FBI
   direct access to the DNC’s servers. It’s unclear why Comey wanted the
   FBI operating on the DNC’s live network, but if the DNC demurred it
   wouldn’t be an unusual call, particularly five months before election
   day.

   “The FBI is looking to investigate and prosecute crimes, and we’re
   looking to return a system to operation as quickly as possible with
   minimal impact,” said Rendition Infosec’s Jake Williams, one of several
   incident response professionals interviewed for this story. “I can tell
   you honestly that had I been part of that incident response, I would
   not have advocated calling in the FBI. Every minute the FBI spends
   keeping the actors in play, that’s a minute I don’t get back in
   prepping for the election. I would absolutely have shared images with
   them.”

   Kenn White, a security expert and former DHS adviser, agreed that the
   FBI wouldn’t have expected direct access to DNC’s computers, “The FBI
   had one of the best cyber security firms in the world giving them
   forensics, and going in depth and reverse engineering to the byte level
   these implants and turning it over.”

   In some versions of the servergate conspiracy theory now espoused by
   Trump, nothing less than physical possession of the hardware will
   suffice, because Crowdstrike, a respected security firm helmed by a
   former senior FBI agent, might be part of the deep state’s efforts to
   frame Putin. White scoffs at that notion, noting that National
   Republican Congressional Committee is one of Crowdstrike’s customers.

   “I’ve done incident response for defense contractors and healthcare
   groups, this is all standard practice,” said White. “It’s completely
   defensible in terms of best practices and what was going on.”
   “We were in close contact and worked cooperatively with the FBI. Any
   suggestion that they were denied access to what they wanted for their
   investigation is completely incorrect.”
   — DNC's Adrienne Watson

   It’s also consistent with the Department of Justice’s electronic
   evidence manual, which recommends capturing images when practical even
   when the FBI is executing a search warrant against a uncooperative
   suspect. When the computers belong to a cooperating victim, seizing the
   machines is pretty much out of the question, said James Harris, a
   former FBI cybercrime agent who worked on a 2009 breach at Google
   that’s been linked to the Chinese government.

   “In most cases you don’t even ask, you just assume you’re going to make
   forensic copies,” said Harris, now vice president of engineering at PFP
   Cyber. “For example when the Google breach happened back in 2009,
   agents were sent out with express instructions that you image what they
   allow you to image, because they’re the victim, you don’t have a search
   warrant, and you don’t want to disrupt their business.”

   There’s a final bit of evidence that the FBI got what it wanted from
   the DNC, and it was filed in the U.S. District Court in Washington,
   D.C. last Friday: 29-pages of inside details showing exactly how and
   when the GRU’s hackers moved through the DNC’s network on their mission
   to help Trump.

   If the president really wants to know what the DNC server is saying,
   it’s all in the indictment against Putin’s hackers. He just has to
   listen.

CLOAK AND DAGGER

The Epic Honey Trap: A Classic Case Shows Just How Far Moscow Will Go

   The French ambassador looked like an easy target, but 100 operatives
   were called on to get him laid, and get him recruited.

   “Eh bien, Dejean, on couche.”

   With that contemptuous locution, which one might translate very roughly
   as, “Well, De Jean, one gets laid,” with perhaps the added thought that
   having made one’s bed, one must lie in it, Charles De Gaulle dismissed
   his old friend Maurice Dejean from diplomatic service to the Fifth
   Republic.

   It was 1964, six years after the KGB had staged one of its long-running
   and most elaborate honey traps in Moscow against a Western diplomat.
   The operation involved over 100 officers and agents of the KGB
   including, incognito, the head of the Second Chief Directorate, the
   branch responsible for domestic surveillance and the monitoring or
   recruitment of foreigners inside the Soviet Union.

   Researching a book entitled 101 Places to Get F*cked Up Before You Die:
   The Ultimate Travel Guide to Partying Around the World may seem like
   the most fun job ever. But editor David S. Miller stresses there’s more
   to it than one might think. He describes the compilation of wild,
   first-person adventure stories pulled from the community of travel
   writers that comprise the Matador Network as a “Trojan Horse:” the
   sensationally-dubbed cover opens to reveal real cultural experiences.

   The book’s crazy title gave Miller pause when he was first approached
   about the project, but he soon realized there was a lot missing in the
   current travel literature. Most features flaunt the best beaches and
   sunsets, but they lack details on how visitors can have authentic
   cultural experiences. “People are just trying to sell the destination,”
   he says. But he wanted this book to provide readers with “culture and
   stories you wouldn’t find in every travel book.”

   “The whole ethos behind the book is: it doesn’t really matter where you
   go…even in Antarctica or the middle of the Bolivian salt flats…if
   you’re the kind of person who isn’t much of risk-taker, this is a time
   to get out and mix it up,” says Miller.

PROTEST VOTE

The Rhino Who Won an Election by a Landslide

   With two of the most unpopular candidates ever, many voters are
   weighing a protest vote or staying home. Citizens of São Paulo once
   took a different approach—and elected an animal.

   As the day approaches to choose between America’s two historically
   unpopular major party nominees, some Americans still seek an
   alternative.

   Perhaps America’s unhappy undecideds should learn from history and
   write-in a Rhino: no, not a Republican in Name Only, a real rhinoceros
   like Cacareco. She charged ahead of a crowded field in the Sao Paolo
   City Council elections in 1959, earning “one of the highest totals for
   a local candidate in Brazil’s recent history,” The New York Times
   reported.

   A serious impulse triggered this Brazilian charade. On October 8, 1959
   in Sao Paolo, sewers were overflowing, prices were soaring, supplies of
   meat, beans, and voter patience were dwindling. Dismayed by the 540
   candidates running for 45 council seats, some students decided, “Better
   elect a rhinoceros than an ass.”

U.S. Intel: ‘High Confidence’ Russia is Behind DNC Hack

   Updated 04.13.17 3:32PM ET / Published 07.26.16 9:28PM ET

   U.S. intelligence agencies have “high confidence” that the Russian
   government perpetrated a leak of Democratic National Committee
   documents, The New York Times reports. This new consensus, apparently
   reached through an investigation by the FBI and other intelligence
   agencies, supports a theory that Russian agents leaked DNC information
   in an attempt to sway American voters against the party. However, these
   agencies have also clarifed that they are not sure whether the DNC
   documents were obtained in a direct effort to influence election
   results, or whether they were obtained during one of the routine hacks
   Russia and many other governments commit.

   An independent security research firm also concluded a Russian
   government hacker was behind the DNC leak, The Daily Beast reported
   Monday. The Virginia-based ThreatConnect firm found that a group of
   Russian hackers, rather than just one individual, had hacked the DNC
   servers.
