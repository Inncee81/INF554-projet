Our Verdict

   F1 2019 retains immaculate handling and visuals while adding cinematic
   spectacle and junior series racing.

NEED TO KNOW

   What is it? The latest licensed F1 racer, now with added cutscenes.

   It seems so obvious now in retrospect. The best way for an annualised,
   licensed motorsport game to stay fresh every summer, clearly, is to
   chuck in an entirely different racing series as well. With the
   inclusion of the 2018 F2 championship, F1 2019 feels, for the first
   time in the series, like a wider world of motorsport. It offers that
   irresistible rags-to-riches journey in career mode, and a handling
   model all of its own to master.

   It makes a lot of sense. Codemasters has had the handling down for
   years now. It's twitchy and frightening, and gives you just the right
   amount of rumble in your hands as you wrestle your car implausibly fast
   over an impeccably rendered apex. It feels in this game, as it has for
   many prior instalments, like a carefully struck balance between
   detailed physics modelling and 'sim-cade' accessibility.

   But the developers needed to add something more than a few handling
   tweaks, and that's a story-driven career mode. Elsewhere in sports
   gaming, this kind of ascendancy through the junior ranks up to the big
   league is becoming de rigeur. And for the twelve other people who play
   the underrated MotoGP series as religiously as this one (see you at the
   next bridge game, folks) it's deliciously ironic to see Codemasters
   borrow an idea from Milestone for a change—Moto2 and Moto3 categories
   have formed the entry point for MotoGP's own career mode for many years
   now.

   F1 2019's career mode is a bit of a surprise, though. Rather than a
   full season of F2 racing, it's a scripted sequence of condensed race
   highlights akin to Codemasters' beloved TOCA: Race Driver, and it
   serves as a prelude to your F1 career. Fictionalised drivers Lukas
   Weber and Devon Butler mix with familiar names like Russell, Norris and
   Ghiotto, and the former are very much cut from the 'broadly drawn
   racing stereotype' cloth. Cocksure English villain with waggly
   eyebrows: step forward, Devon. Bavarian stickler for rules and
   procedure: take a bow, Mr Weber.

   That's not necessarily to the detriment of this potted F2 season
   matinee. What is, however, is the fact it's over so quickly. Barely
   half an hour passes before you're spat out of the other side of F2 and
   picking an F1 team. Granted, not everyone wants to get stuck into a
   full race calendar—and indeed it’s possible to do so in a separate F2
   season mode which has no bearing on your career, but it would have been
   nice to have the option of working a bit harder for your F1 race seat.
   As it is, choosing your F2 team determines the level of interest you'll
   receive from various F1 teams, so your choice does at least feeling
   meaningful even if the season's fleeting.

   When you graduate to the big cars, the career mode format takes on a
   familiar complexion from last year’s game. It's once again gratifying
   to earn the trust of your team by hitting their performance targets. As
   you move forward you gain access to the RPG-like car upgrade tree and
   spend points to improve your car. My Williams was in dire need of aero
   upgrades in my debut season for example, whereas the Renault-powered
   teams need to find engine performance to bridge the gap to Mercedes.
   That kind of granular detail in its simulation of the sport has long
   separated the F1 series from other licensed racers, and it remains
   impressive in this game.

     Winning the championship means that little bit more in F1 2019, and
     hammy cinematics are a small price to pay for that.

   That’s the format. But there’s a twist in the tale: Lukas Weber and
   Devon Butler graduate to F1 along with you, replacing two real drivers
   and popping up in cutscenes which amp up the sense of rivalry (and, to
   be honest, am-dram theatre). Butler and Weber are free to drive
   wherever the game takes them. They might even become your team-mate at
   some point.

   Yes, it all seems very silly if you sit watching the cutscenes like
   Roger Ebert expecting Oscar-worthy spectacle. But this rivals plotline
   really does work: you feel motivated not just to win a contract with
   the race-winning teams, but now to do so before your contemporaries.
   Winning the championship means that little bit more in F1 2019, and
   hammy cinematics are a small price to pay for that.

   Changes are afoot over in multiplayer too, with a focus on visual
   customisation. Custom car liveries have been introduced, along with
   team-agnostic overalls and gloves. So rather than each multiplayer
   event being a game of F1 cosplay you’re free to express yourself—if you
   can afford the cosmetic items. Most are possible to unlock by spending
   in-game currency accrued elsewhere, but a few appear to be
   microtransaction-only affairs. At the time of writing, we’re unable to
   click through to the Steam Store to see how they’re priced.

   A new leagues system and improved race highlights mode both bolster F1
   2019’s eSports cred, which is good news for pro sim racers and those
   aspiring to be the next Brendon Leigh alike. I’m still not totally sold
   on the virtual stewards and how they dole out penalties, but I’ve yet
   to play a racing sim online that has cracked that particular nut
   agreeably.

   This isn’t a tangible leap forward in the fundamentals of the F1
   series—the handling and visuals remain roughly where they were last
   year, which is to say: excellent. What Codemasters have managed to add
   into the series in an impressively short span though is a wealth of new
   solo content that enriches career mode and offers a totally different
   challenge outside it. Many more hours of online racing will be needed
   before the strength of its infrastructure can be commented on—but at
   release, F1 2019 is generous, stable, and thrilling as ever.

   Correction: A previous version of this review implied that drivers
   wouldn't change teams. In fact, driver transfers are fully supported.

   Breezy fun that also rewards combo-chasing mastery. Barrel through the
   story once for a laugh, then replay the best levels until you are John
   Wick on a skateboard.

   The gamers running at me have swords, because all gamers own swords, I
   guess. They also have Monty Python Dark Souls cosplay armor, but it
   can't save them from the shotgun blasts that reduce them to lumps at my
   feet. I'm out of ammo before I'm out of gamers, the last one charging
   with sword held high. But any object you kick is a one-shot kill in
   this game, and dead gamer lumps are kickable objects.

   There are more impressive gun-fu stunts in My Friend Pedro than
   breaking somebody's neck by kicking their dead friend's torso at them,
   but this moment of improvisation is typical of what happens between
   gif-able highlights. Once or twice per level I'll do something like
   skateboard through a window and then kick that skateboard at someone
   while shooting someone else, or I'll throw a frying pan into the air
   and then ricochet bullets off it to clear a room.

   But the meat and potatoes of My Friend Pedro isn't these set pieces.
   It's jumping in and relying on the combination of a generous slow-mo
   meter, physics objects, and a lot of bullets to see you through.

This shit is bananas

   I should mention the talking banana. His name is Pedro and he's full of
   potassium and advice on how to kill people, whether retired mafiosi or
   Christmas-themed bounty hunters or gamers driven to madness by violent
   videogames. There's a story in My Friend Pedro but a minimal one—it
   feels like the plot of another hyperviolent Devolver game, Ruiner, only
   told on fast-forward. Pedro is there to explain things, but more
   importantly he appears in the corner of the screen when you pull off a
   high-scoring combo and tells you what rank you got at the end of a
   level.

   It's a score-attack game, with bonus points for chaining together kills
   in combos. There are leaderboards, and I have replayed several levels
   just to get a higher rank than James. (Suck it, James.) Chasing high
   scores makes me look ahead at a level and think things like, "I should
   ride the barrel onto that guy then jump off while dual-wielding and
   split my fire so I can shoot that one and the other before I land."

   Split-fire looked neat in the gifs Pedro's designer showed off during
   development, but I was worried it would feel rough in play. I was super
   wrong. It's easy: right-click on one dude and hold to lock him in, and
   then for every left-click shot, no matter where it's aimed, the
   right-click guy gets a bullet as well. Levels that drop you down shafts
   with enemies on both sides, or have doors full of goons opening around
   you, are built for this. I never stopped enjoying it.

   IFRAME: https://gfycat.com/ifr/bravecarefreedouglasfirbarkbeetle

   These are also fine moments for dodging by pressing W, which sends you
   into a bulletproof pirouette. Shooting while dodging sends bullets
   flying in whichever direction your guns happen to be pointing during
   that part of the animation, wild sprays flying around as you whirl
   about like a dog in a tumble dryer. Again: enjoyable.

   Later levels reduce the number of physics objects like skateboards,
   basketballs, and knives, as well as goons to fling them at, in favor of
   mines, lasers, spinning platforms, and traps that require more
   perfectionist play. There's not as much freedom to rack up combos and a
   lot more falling to your death. They're less fun to replay, and I wish
   there were notes in the level select screen that said "this level is
   cool and has a skateboard" or "this one has too many lasers". There's
   one in the dream-like midsection with no enemies, a pure platforming
   challenge that doesn't play to My Friend Pedro's strengths.

   So some levels are weaker, but before long there's always a refresher
   level that plays completely differently, a motorbike chase or a
   freefall or a boss fight. To pay My Friend Pedro the highest
   compliment, its boss fights didn't annoy me. They're bombastic,
   inventive, and they're over fast.

   Along with the score, at the end of every level Pedro gives you a gif
   of a highlight to save or share. Postcards from murderland, they slice
   My Friend Pedro into a handful of enjoyable seconds. Its take on
   bullet-time is fun for more than seconds, though. Unlike Superhot or
   Max Payne I never got tired of its bullet-time thanks to short levels,
   high variety, and a storyline that's purest nonsense.

Final Fantasy 14: Shadowbringers review

The next expansion in Square Enix's MMO is easily the best yet.

Our Verdict

   Coupled with a striking new world to explore, Shadowbringers' poignant
   and character-driven story is one of the best in the entire series.

Need to know

   What is it? A bleak and story-heavy expansion to Square Enix's great
   MMO.

   Nearly a month ago I wrote that Final Fantasy 14 was my favorite MMO
   that I hate to recommend. Playing it requires an enormous investment of
   time—at least a few hundred hours—and even though I love it, I worried
   that others might ultimately find that long journey boring and
   unsatisfying. But after beating Shadowbringers, Final Fantasy 14's
   latest expansion, those worries are gone.

   Shadowbringers is the Avengers: Endgame of Final Fantasy 14, an
   emotionally stirring climax that draws on six years of character
   development, storytelling, and worldbuilding to weave an epic,
   dimension-spanning story rooted in the relationships of its chief
   characters.

Paint it black

     It's these long and meandering character arcs that make my
     adventures feel so epic in scale, like if Game of Thrones was a
     high-fantasy anime.

   If you're not familiar with Final Fantasy 14's story, it's difficult to
   describe Shadowbringers' premise without spoiling everything that comes
   before. With three expansions and hundreds of hours of story under its
   belt, the world of Final Fantasy 14 is so complicated and nuanced you
   should be able to get a degree in its history. It's intimidating to
   newcomers—especially because the first part of Final Fantasy 14's
   overarching story is a slow burn—but as a long-time player I love how
   rich and vast the world and its characters have become.

   The gist is that, after the events of Stormblood, the world of Hydaelyn
   is on the precipice of an apocalyptic war orchestrated by the evil
   Ascians, immortal beings who want to see the world plunged into chaos
   as a means to revive their dark god. To help tip the first domino, the
   Ascians are hoping to cause an apocalypse in an alternate dimension
   that'll cascade into Hydaelyn itself. My companions and I have to
   adventure to this alternate dimension, called The First, to save it and
   in turn save Hydaelyn. It's exactly the sort of plot you'd expect from
   Brainiac, Dr. Doom, or Thanos, only wrapped up in an anime-inspired
   high-fantasy aesthetic.

   But unlike Hydaelyn, where I'm constantly fighting the forces of
   darkness, The First has the opposite problem: A century earlier
   darkness was defeated, giving rise to an abundance of primordial light
   that has almost wiped out the entire planet and spawned an army of
   divine monsters called Sin Eaters. To save The First, I have to swap
   sides and become the Warrior of Darkness, a quest that explores the
   powers of light and darkness beyond whether they are merely good or
   evil.

   Shadowbringers' success is, in part, owed to the way Square Enix has
   carefully built the world of Final Fantasy 14 over these past six
   years. Though previous expansions have always been a direct
   continuation of the main story, the scope of Shadowbringers is almost
   dizzying by comparison. Characters, lore, and story beats that have
   been left to simmer for years suddenly boil over in dramatic narrative
   twists and turns that make this 50-hour journey an absolute
   rollercoaster.

   When the hero Arbert first appeared all the way back in Heavensward as
   a minor character, for example, I never could have imagined the pivotal
   role he would grow to have in Shadowbringers. It's these long and
   meandering character arcs that make my adventures feel MMO-sized, like
   if Game of Thrones was a high-fantasy anime.

   Despite being an MMO, Shadowbringers does a remarkable job of emulating
   that golden era of JRPGs through well-written dialogue and evocative
   cutscenes. If you hate fetch quests in MMOs, Shadowbringers
   unfortunately has those in spades but I hardly cared because the
   context of those quests—and the cutscenes that often followed—were so
   enticing.

   Shadowbringers' eclectic cast is one of its best strengths.

     Emet Selch could easily be the best nemesis of any Final Fantasy
     game since FF6's Kekfa.

   The writing and voice acting has been steadily improving since A Realm
   Reborn, but the bleakness of Shadowbringers casts the drama in a much
   more mature, and at times disturbing, new light. One early quest led me
   to a sanitorium full of people who had been infected with the light
   and, in time, would turn into Sin Eaters. Without a cure, the
   caretakers' only option was to delay the inevitable and then euthanize
   them. Elsewhere, the city Eulmore is full of upper-class elite living
   in excess as they wait for the impending apocalypse while, just outside
   the walls, the poor, sick, and starving waste away.

   Shadowbringers addresses these heavy subjects well in the face of Final
   Fantasy's extensive melodrama, but my favorite part of the story is how
   much depth it adds to my cast of longtime companions. Thancred's story
   is especially gut-wrenching and brings a bittersweet end to one of
   FF14's longest character arcs.

   Even better was Shadowbringers' ploy to have the MMO's grand villain,
   Emet Selch, tag along for most of the adventure. Few stories ever
   manage to make me sympathize with a villain while still retaining what
   makes them detestable, but Emet Selch could be the best Final Fantasy
   nemesis since FF6's Kekfa. He's batshit crazy but so charismatic and
   likeable that I wish we didn't have to be enemies.

Black in action

   Though its story is the best reason to play, Shadowbringers adds a lot
   of other neat features. The new Gunbreaker and Dancer are both fun new
   jobs (FF14 parlance for classes) that each have a distinct playstyle
   and the new bunny-like Vi and tiger-esque Hrothgar character races are
   natural additions to the world (though I hate how many bikini-clad Vi
   I'm seeing everywhere now).

   (Image credit: Square Enix)

   These features are less exciting only because they so closely follow
   the same template that Square Enix has laid out since Heavensward.
   Instead of overhauling core game systems with each expansion like World
   of Warcraft, Final Fantasy 14 tends to play it safe. While that makes
   the addition of new jobs, raids, and other features feel somewhat
   predictable, I don't mind since everything is consistently good and
   fun—especially the new dungeons, which are some of my favorite out of
   any expansion so far.

   The story tees up each dungeon and single-boss raid (called Trials) so
   well, turning each one into a climactic finale for each zone-specific
   questline. After spending so long in the barren, gritty deserts of
   Stormblood's areas, the dungeons and zones of Shadowbringers are a
   visual feast. Il Mheg and its accompanying dungeon of Dohn Mheg are my
   two favorites.

   The former is an entire area stripped straight out of The Dark Crystal,
   an enchanting land full of playful fairies and a colony of talking
   dog-birds ruled over by a fairy king who also happens to be a Sin
   Eater. To supplant her, I had to complete the dungeon of Dohn Mheg, a
   vibrant underwater dreamland ruled over by a top-hat wearing frog
   spirit.

   It's unlike anything else in Final Fantasy 14, but instead of clashing
   with the bleak story of Shadowbringers' other areas, it ends up being a
   welcome reprieve capped off with a grueling battle against the fairy
   king herself. Shadowbringers continues FF14's legacy for astounding
   music and flashy spell effects that make each boss fight memorable and
   thrilling.

   If there's one area that Final Fantasy 14 is struggling with, it's in
   job balance and design, though. Shadowbringers reworked nearly every
   job, pruning old abilities while also adding some new ones. Most of the
   damage-dealing jobs are improved by these changes, but as a White Mage
   it's disappointing to see some of my favorite spells taken away and
   replaced with a new healing system that doesn't add any complexity to
   combat. Instead, I'm just waiting for a meter to slowly fill so I can
   cast the associated spell.

   That isn't to say combat in Shadowbringers isn't fun. Shadowbringers'
   new raid bosses are still the best out of any MMO—demanding excellent
   team coordination while delivering an explosive spectacle that makes
   each fight feel tense and exciting.

   Since Final Fantasy 14 relaunched six years ago, Square Enix has also
   kept up a good tempo of major updates every three or four months.
   Assuming Shadowbringers continues that template I'm excited to see
   where it goes next. But its main story is already so good that
   Shadowbringers is worth playing even if you have no intention of
   committing hundreds of more hours grinding raid bosses for loot drops.
   Final Fantasy 14 is quietly one of the best games in the series, but
   Shadowbringers elevates it even further by telling a bleak and
   heartfelt tale that generously rewards the investment made by its most
   hardcore fans.

The Verdict

Final Fantasy 14

   Coupled with a striking new world to explore, Shadowbringers' poignant
   and character-driven story is one of the best in the entire series.

Our Verdict

   A flexible roguelike with more than enough playstyles to keep you
   coming back.

Need to Know

   What is it? A chaotic rogue-like with endless player choice.
   Expect to pay: $20 / £15.50
   Developer: Matt Dabrowski
   Publisher: tinyBuild
   Reviewed on: i7-7700HQ, GTX 1050Ti, 8GB RAM
   Multiplayer: Up to four-player co-op, both online and local
   Link: Official Site

   On my first run, I'm an assassin, backstabbing enemies and slinging
   shuriken. Then I'm a jock, barrelling through walls and swinging a
   baseball bat. Next, I'm a gorilla, flanked by three other primates,
   tearing scientists apart with my bare hands in the middle of downtown.
   Somehow, I avoid the patrolling cops on that last one, probably because
   I’d injected two of my companions with an invisibility serum—plus,
   there was a riot in the streets, turning the level into a mosh pit of
   gang fights, enraged shop owners, and firefighters whacking office
   workers with axes.

   In the brilliant, bananas 2D roguelike Streets of Rogue, you play as
   one of 26 characters, killing targets and stealing macguffins from
   guarded buildings. After you finish all your missions you take the
   elevator to the next procedurally-generated floor, and keep going until
   you die or reach the end. Missions are formulaic and repeat often, and
   the world doesn’t feel all that different between stages despite a few
   new buildings and NPC types, but what makes Streets of Rogue special,
   and unpredictable, is the unique traits of each character, which
   constantly create new, surprising interactions with the world.

Cannibals and vampires

   Streets of Rogue is designed in the style of an immersive sim, in that
   each character has multiple ways to approach any given situation. As
   the hacker, I’m asked to kill a member of the blue gang, the Crepes.
   He’s surrounded by buddies, and as a scrawny nerd I’m no good with my
   fists or a pistol. There are no nearby turrets I can program to target
   him and no computers to blow up in his face, which are two of my usual
   tricks. Instead, I hire him as a bodyguard for the rest of the level,
   walk to the other side of town, and dive into a den of red gang Blahds,
   who gun him down without blinking. Job done.

   After a zombie infestation special event cuts that run short, I choose
   the cannibal, who regenerates health by munching corpses. On the third
   floor, I have to steal a wallet from a chest in the back room of a bar.
   But bartenders don’t like cannibals, and if I try to walk in I’ll be
   bounced out by him and his customers. I could blow a hole in the wall
   with a grenade, but everyone outside will see. Instead, I pour a vial
   of a mystery liquid into the air filtration system, which saps their
   strength. I burst through the door and beat them bloody, gorge on their
   bodies, and help myself to the wallet, ignoring the wailing camera on
   the wall.

   (Image credit: Matt Dabrowski/tinyBuildE)

     It’s a build-your-own roguelike, basically, and you can make it as
     hard or as easy as you like.

   As well as randomised missions, each character has their own optional
   ‘big quest’, and if you complete its task on each of a run’s 15 levels
   you receive a new permanent ability for that class. They’re often the
   highlight of a run. The bartender has to make and serve three drinks to
   different NPCs on each level, and each recipe has its own effect on the
   drinker, enraging them, poisoning them, or making them super fast. The
   firefighter’s big quest is to extinguish fires set by arsonists, who
   only appear if you choose that character.

   These quests, and the unique traits of each character, make picking a
   new class feel like playing a completely different game. With the
   assassin, who can go invisible and chain stab enemies, I’m playing a
   slow-burn stealth game. With the soldier and their machinegun, it’s a
   top-down shooter. Streets of Rogue is not groundbreaking as either, but
   being able to choose between 26 different playstyles makes it hard to
   stop playing. I still have a handful of characters to unlock, including
   a vampire who must kill a hidden werewolf on each level.

   And after 15 hours, I’m still finding new ways to use characters I
   thought I’d mastered. I only just realised, for example, that hackers
   can hack fridges to make them literally ‘run’ (geddit?), flattening
   anyone in their path and then bursting open to reveal the food inside,
   which restores HP. I also just discovered eating burnt bodies restores
   more HP as the cannibal, so I buy a flamethrower whenever I can.

Mutations

   Even if you stick with one character, each run takes on its own
   personality thanks to the items you find in shops, chests and safes, as
   well as the traits you pick up between levels. Finishing a floor lets
   you choose a trait from a list of three, and you can push for a
   specific playstyle by picking traits that match. I pair a trait that
   lets me recruit extra followers with one that gives followers more
   health to start a roving gang that can win almost any fight.

   Streets of Rogue also boasts a huge list of custom rules, called
   mutators, that you can toggle on and off, and you can decide exactly
   which traits and items appear in the unlock pool. It’s a build-your-own
   roguelike, basically, and you can make it as hard or as easy as you
   like. After a series of slower runs I turned on bigger bullets,
   exploding bodies, and faster move speed. It’s utter chaos.

   (Image credit: Matt Dabrowski/tinyBuildE)

     I’m off to see how exactly how much damage a comedian can do if you
     give them a rocket launcher, infinite ammo and an inventory full of
     bacon cheeseburgers.

   There are a few things I find bothersome. Commanding your companions is
   fiddly, but if you don’t micromanage them they’ll run off and get
   themselves killed. It’s too easy to get into buildings by knocking on
   the door, waiting for the person to answer and ducking inside as soon
   as they turn around. As I mentioned, the levels are uninspiring—each
   three-floor stage has a different skin, but the changes never really
   affect the action. And the four-player co-op isn’t much fun with
   strangers because distractions scatter players in different
   directions.

   The inclusion of slavery feels entirely out of place, too. Most levels
   have slavemasters that you can buy slaves from, and you can unlock the
   slavemaster as a playable character. In a game with a caricatured world
   where chicken nuggets are a black market currency, the inclusion of
   slavery is jarring, especially when the slaves make jokes (“Hey,
   remember when you literally owned me? Wow, those were the days…”).

   Those sticking points aside, Streets of Rogue is absolutely worth
   playing, and once you start, it’s hard to stop. It gives you more
   freedom than almost any roguelike, and its varied cast of characters,
   combined with the randomness of traits and mutators, mean no two runs
   play out the same way.

   Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m off to see how exactly how much damage a
   comedian can do if you give them a rocket launcher, infinite ammo and
   an inventory full of bacon cheeseburgers.

Dicey Dungeons forges one RNG to rule them all.

Our Verdict

   Endearing, compulsive, and just weird enough to want to keep exploring.

Need to know

   What is it? A crossbreed of CCG and roguelike dungeon-crawling.
   Expect to pay: $15/£11.39
   Developer: Terry Cavanagh
   Publisher: Terry Cavanagh
   Reviewed on: i5 6500, RTX 2080 TI, 32GB RAM
   Multiplayer? None
   Link: Official site

   Dicey Dungeons rolls you a few dice, presents you with cards which
   harness those dice in damage-dealing or character-buffing fashion, and
   pits you against a series of opponents in an offbeat dungeon-crawling
   RPG setting. It feels vaguely like playing a CCG while wearing x-ray
   specs.

   The roguelikes and card games Dicey Dungeons is referencing with its
   art and design would hide away their RNG elements, but Terry Cavanagh’s
   new game puts the dice under a spotlight. Quite literally: the setup is
   that of a gameshow, so while you’re fighting sneezy hedgehogs and
   sharply dressed hammerhead sharks there’s a studio audience gasping and
   cheering over it all. They ooh and aah when you open chests in its
   simple dungeon maps. There’s even a wheel of fortune. Those disparate
   elements—rolling dice, D&D-inspired questing, and the gameshows of
   yesteryear—shouldn’t gel together, but somehow it all feels like the
   most natural thing in the world while you’re playing.

   (Image credit: Terry Cavanagh)

   Cavanagh’s previous games, VVVVVV and Super Hexagon, were about
   attritional runs against a conceptually simple but supremely demanding
   challenge. This—well, this is not. It’s actually all rather friendly,
   starting you off with a tutorial and building on itself very gradually
   with each encounter. And sure, rolling two dice and dragging them over
   into two weapon card slots to deal damage might not sound captivating
   on paper, but every new element it introduces makes you stop for a
   second and re-evaluate where this is all leading.

   Within the opening hour you’re dealing out shock, fire, and freezing
   damage, locking opponents’ dice, and firing off double-attacks when
   your limit break bar fills up from taking damage. And crucially, you
   feel like some kind of mastermind tactician while you do it.

   That’s the trick in Dicey Dungeons. You’re always being given the
   chance to make a smart decision, whether it’s holding off on doing
   damage to pool some dice into a healing card—these are activated on
   hitting a certain high number, say 16—or using buffs to hit exact
   numbers required by status effect cards. I’m convinced there’s still
   another layer of RNG beneath the hood that makes for the most
   entertaining fights—I mean, the Loud Bird I encountered at level 5
   rolled one double, an even and two dice under 5 every round when I
   fought him—but with the information you have, there are always
   opportunities to pull off something that feels clever.

   (Image credit: Terry Cavanagh)

     At some point you’re certain to pause and wonder how you ended up
     putting such brainpower into the meta of a chirpy cartoon dice game.

   At the end of each dungeon run is a boss and a new unlockable
   character. Bosses offer surprisingly little challenge though, and are
   sometimes outmatched by one or two of the enemies you had to best on
   the way to them. It's unusually lenient from the developer who made
   surviving for ten seconds in Super Hexagon feel like a
   once-in-a-lifetime feat of skill. Nevertheless, with the boss roasted
   and a new character for the taking, it’s back to the dungeons for a
   series of ever-escalating challenges.

   There’s a deceptively massive chunk of game here, and if the likes of
   Hearthstone or Gwent never clicked with you it’s an easy way to slide
   into the world of agonising over deck builds. You only have space for a
   handful of cards, but striking the right balance between attack,
   defense, and modifiers is just as engrossing. At some point you’re
   certain to pause and wonder how you ended up putting such brainpower
   into the meta of a chirpy cartoon dice game.

   (Image credit: Terry Cavanagh)

   Like an over-eager Tinder date, the vibe is very much casual and
   lighthearted at first, but before too long you’re made aware that the
   expectation is absolutely that of a long-term prospect. Unlike a
   stranger you swiped on the internet though, Dicey Dungeons doesn’t keep
   liking your Instagram posts months after you stop playing it.

   And, to jettison that analogy entirely before it’s stretched well
   beyond its limit, it does a surprisingly good job of world-building.
   When you fight a Baby Squid, its attacks involve squirting ink which
   blinds you to some of your dice. Hedgehogs use a lot of spikes. The
   aforementioned Loud Bird uses sound to its advantage. This is all via
   the medium of dice rolls, you understand, but it’s easy to be pulled
   into the surreal ‘90s cartoon-like world just the same.

   Longer term play is limited by the absence of multiplayer, but as a
   slice of solo deck-building Dicey Dungeons is engrossing, not to
   mention buoyed by great art and presentation. I do feel that faint itch
   to just load up Gwent and tend to my decks there instead when I play,
   but Gwent doesn’t look anywhere near as much like Ren & Stimpy as this.

F1 2019 review

With scripted drama and F2 racing, F1 2019 tells a compelling motorsport
story.

Our Verdict

   F1 2019 retains immaculate handling and visuals while adding cinematic
   spectacle and junior series racing.

NEED TO KNOW

   What is it? The latest licensed F1 racer, now with added cutscenes.
   Reviewed on i5 8600k, RTX 2080 ti, 16GB RAM
   Expect to pay $60 / £45
   Developer Codemasters
   Publisher Codemasters
   Multiplayer Up to 20 players
   Link Official site

   It seems so obvious now in retrospect. The best way for an annualised,
   licensed motorsport game to stay fresh every summer, clearly, is to
   chuck in an entirely different racing series as well. With the
   inclusion of the 2018 F2 championship, F1 2019 feels, for the first
   time in the series, like a wider world of motorsport. It offers that
   irresistible rags-to-riches journey in career mode, and a handling
   model all of its own to master.

   It makes a lot of sense. Codemasters has had the handling down for
   years now. It's twitchy and frightening, and gives you just the right
   amount of rumble in your hands as you wrestle your car implausibly fast
   over an impeccably rendered apex. It feels in this game, as it has for
   many prior instalments, like a carefully struck balance between
   detailed physics modelling and 'sim-cade' accessibility.

   But the developers needed to add something more than a few handling
   tweaks, and that's a story-driven career mode. Elsewhere in sports
   gaming, this kind of ascendancy through the junior ranks up to the big
   league is becoming de rigeur. And for the twelve other people who play
   the underrated MotoGP series as religiously as this one (see you at the
   next bridge game, folks) it's deliciously ironic to see Codemasters
   borrow an idea from Milestone for a change—Moto2 and Moto3 categories
   have formed the entry point for MotoGP's own career mode for many years
   now.

   F1 2019's career mode is a bit of a surprise, though. Rather than a
   full season of F2 racing, it's a scripted sequence of condensed race
   highlights akin to Codemasters' beloved TOCA: Race Driver, and it
   serves as a prelude to your F1 career. Fictionalised drivers Lukas
   Weber and Devon Butler mix with familiar names like Russell, Norris and
   Ghiotto, and the former are very much cut from the 'broadly drawn
   racing stereotype' cloth. Cocksure English villain with waggly
   eyebrows: step forward, Devon. Bavarian stickler for rules and
   procedure: take a bow, Mr Weber.

   That's not necessarily to the detriment of this potted F2 season
   matinee. What is, however, is the fact it's over so quickly. Barely
   half an hour passes before you're spat out of the other side of F2 and
   picking an F1 team. Granted, not everyone wants to get stuck into a
   full race calendar—and indeed it’s possible to do so in a separate F2
   season mode which has no bearing on your career, but it would have been
   nice to have the option of working a bit harder for your F1 race seat.
   As it is, choosing your F2 team determines the level of interest you'll
   receive from various F1 teams, so your choice does at least feeling
   meaningful even if the season's fleeting.

   When you graduate to the big cars, the career mode format takes on a
   familiar complexion from last year’s game. It's once again gratifying
   to earn the trust of your team by hitting their performance targets. As
   you move forward you gain access to the RPG-like car upgrade tree and
   spend points to improve your car. My Williams was in dire need of aero
   upgrades in my debut season for example, whereas the Renault-powered
   teams need to find engine performance to bridge the gap to Mercedes.
   That kind of granular detail in its simulation of the sport has long
   separated the F1 series from other licensed racers, and it remains
   impressive in this game.

     Winning the championship means that little bit more in F1 2019, and
     hammy cinematics are a small price to pay for that.

   That’s the format. But there’s a twist in the tale: Lukas Weber and
   Devon Butler graduate to F1 along with you, replacing two real drivers
   and popping up in cutscenes which amp up the sense of rivalry (and, to
   be honest, am-dram theatre). Butler and Weber are free to drive
   wherever the game takes them. They might even become your team-mate at
   some point.

   Yes, it all seems very silly if you sit watching the cutscenes like
   Roger Ebert expecting Oscar-worthy spectacle. But this rivals plotline
   really does work: you feel motivated not just to win a contract with
   the race-winning teams, but now to do so before your contemporaries.
   Winning the championship means that little bit more in F1 2019, and
   hammy cinematics are a small price to pay for that.

   Changes are afoot over in multiplayer too, with a focus on visual
   customisation. Custom car liveries have been introduced, along with
   team-agnostic overalls and gloves. So rather than each multiplayer
   event being a game of F1 cosplay you’re free to express yourself—if you
   can afford the cosmetic items. Most are possible to unlock by spending
   in-game currency accrued elsewhere, but a few appear to be
   microtransaction-only affairs. At the time of writing, we’re unable to
   click through to the Steam Store to see how they’re priced.

   A new leagues system and improved race highlights mode both bolster F1
   2019’s eSports cred, which is good news for pro sim racers and those
   aspiring to be the next Brendon Leigh alike. I’m still not totally sold
   on the virtual stewards and how they dole out penalties, but I’ve yet
   to play a racing sim online that has cracked that particular nut
   agreeably.

   This isn’t a tangible leap forward in the fundamentals of the F1
   series—the handling and visuals remain roughly where they were last
   year, which is to say: excellent. What Codemasters have managed to add
   into the series in an impressively short span though is a wealth of new
   solo content that enriches career mode and offers a totally different
   challenge outside it. Many more hours of online racing will be needed
   before the strength of its infrastructure can be commented on—but at
   release, F1 2019 is generous, stable, and thrilling as ever.

   Correction: A previous version of this review implied that drivers
   wouldn't change teams. In fact, driver transfers are fully supported.

Our Verdict

   Breezy fun that also rewards combo-chasing mastery. Barrel through the
   story once for a laugh, then replay the best levels until you are John
   Wick on a skateboard.

   The gamers running at me have swords, because all gamers own swords, I
   guess. They also have Monty Python Dark Souls cosplay armor, but it
   can't save them from the shotgun blasts that reduce them to lumps at my
   feet. I'm out of ammo before I'm out of gamers, the last one charging
   with sword held high. But any object you kick is a one-shot kill in
   this game, and dead gamer lumps are kickable objects.

   There are more impressive gun-fu stunts in My Friend Pedro than
   breaking somebody's neck by kicking their dead friend's torso at them,
   but this moment of improvisation is typical of what happens between
   gif-able highlights. Once or twice per level I'll do something like
   skateboard through a window and then kick that skateboard at someone
   while shooting someone else, or I'll throw a frying pan into the air
   and then ricochet bullets off it to clear a room.

   But the meat and potatoes of My Friend Pedro isn't these set pieces.
   It's jumping in and relying on the combination of a generous slow-mo
   meter, physics objects, and a lot of bullets to see you through.

This shit is bananas

   I should mention the talking banana. His name is Pedro and he's full of
   potassium and advice on how to kill people, whether retired mafiosi or
   Christmas-themed bounty hunters or gamers driven to madness by violent
   videogames. There's a story in My Friend Pedro but a minimal one—it
   feels like the plot of another hyperviolent Devolver game, Ruiner, only
   told on fast-forward. Pedro is there to explain things, but more
   importantly he appears in the corner of the screen when you pull off a
   high-scoring combo and tells you what rank you got at the end of a
   level.

   It's a score-attack game, with bonus points for chaining together kills
   in combos. There are leaderboards, and I have replayed several levels
   just to get a higher rank than James. (Suck it, James.) Chasing high
   scores makes me look ahead at a level and think things like, "I should
   ride the barrel onto that guy then jump off while dual-wielding and
   split my fire so I can shoot that one and the other before I land."

   Split-fire looked neat in the gifs Pedro's designer showed off during
   development, but I was worried it would feel rough in play. I was super
   wrong. It's easy: right-click on one dude and hold to lock him in, and
   then for every left-click shot, no matter where it's aimed, the
   right-click guy gets a bullet as well. Levels that drop you down shafts
   with enemies on both sides, or have doors full of goons opening around
   you, are built for this. I never stopped enjoying it.

   IFRAME: https://gfycat.com/ifr/bravecarefreedouglasfirbarkbeetle

   These are also fine moments for dodging by pressing W, which sends you
   into a bulletproof pirouette. Shooting while dodging sends bullets
   flying in whichever direction your guns happen to be pointing during
   that part of the animation, wild sprays flying around as you whirl
   about like a dog in a tumble dryer. Again: enjoyable.

   Later levels reduce the number of physics objects like skateboards,
   basketballs, and knives, as well as goons to fling them at, in favor of
   mines, lasers, spinning platforms, and traps that require more
   perfectionist play. There's not as much freedom to rack up combos and a
   lot more falling to your death. They're less fun to replay, and I wish
   there were notes in the level select screen that said "this level is
   cool and has a skateboard" or "this one has too many lasers". There's
   one in the dream-like midsection with no enemies, a pure platforming
   challenge that doesn't play to My Friend Pedro's strengths.

   So some levels are weaker, but before long there's always a refresher
   level that plays completely differently, a motorbike chase or a
   freefall or a boss fight. To pay My Friend Pedro the highest
   compliment, its boss fights didn't annoy me. They're bombastic,
   inventive, and they're over fast.

   Along with the score, at the end of every level Pedro gives you a gif
   of a highlight to save or share. Postcards from murderland, they slice
   My Friend Pedro into a handful of enjoyable seconds. Its take on
   bullet-time is fun for more than seconds, though. Unlike Superhot or
   Max Payne I never got tired of its bullet-time thanks to short levels,
   high variety, and a storyline that's purest nonsense.

Final Fantasy 14: Shadowbringers review

The next expansion in Square Enix's MMO is easily the best yet.

Our Verdict

   Coupled with a striking new world to explore, Shadowbringers' poignant
   and character-driven story is one of the best in the entire series.

Need to know

   What is it? A bleak and story-heavy expansion to Square Enix's great
   MMO.
   Expect to pay: $40 + $15/mo subscription fee
   Developer: Square Enix
   Publisher: Square Enix
   Reviewed on: Windows 10, Core i7-8700, 32GB RAM, GeForce RTX 2070
   Multiplayer: MMO
   Link: https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/shadowbringers/

   Nearly a month ago I wrote that Final Fantasy 14 was my favorite MMO
   that I hate to recommend. Playing it requires an enormous investment of
   time—at least a few hundred hours—and even though I love it, I worried
   that others might ultimately find that long journey boring and
   unsatisfying. But after beating Shadowbringers, Final Fantasy 14's
   latest expansion, those worries are gone.

   Shadowbringers is the Avengers: Endgame of Final Fantasy 14, an
   emotionally stirring climax that draws on six years of character
   development, storytelling, and worldbuilding to weave an epic,
   dimension-spanning story rooted in the relationships of its chief
   characters.

Paint it black

     It's these long and meandering character arcs that make my
     adventures feel so epic in scale, like if Game of Thrones was a
     high-fantasy anime.

   If you're not familiar with Final Fantasy 14's story, it's difficult to
   describe Shadowbringers' premise without spoiling everything that comes
   before. With three expansions and hundreds of hours of story under its
   belt, the world of Final Fantasy 14 is so complicated and nuanced you
   should be able to get a degree in its history. It's intimidating to
   newcomers—especially because the first part of Final Fantasy 14's
   overarching story is a slow burn—but as a long-time player I love how
   rich and vast the world and its characters have become.

   The gist is that, after the events of Stormblood, the world of Hydaelyn
   is on the precipice of an apocalyptic war orchestrated by the evil
   Ascians, immortal beings who want to see the world plunged into chaos
   as a means to revive their dark god. To help tip the first domino, the
   Ascians are hoping to cause an apocalypse in an alternate dimension
   that'll cascade into Hydaelyn itself. My companions and I have to
   adventure to this alternate dimension, called The First, to save it and
   in turn save Hydaelyn. It's exactly the sort of plot you'd expect from
   Brainiac, Dr. Doom, or Thanos, only wrapped up in an anime-inspired
   high-fantasy aesthetic.

   But unlike Hydaelyn, where I'm constantly fighting the forces of
   darkness, The First has the opposite problem: A century earlier
   darkness was defeated, giving rise to an abundance of primordial light
   that has almost wiped out the entire planet and spawned an army of
   divine monsters called Sin Eaters. To save The First, I have to swap
   sides and become the Warrior of Darkness, a quest that explores the
   powers of light and darkness beyond whether they are merely good or
   evil.

   Shadowbringers' success is, in part, owed to the way Square Enix has
   carefully built the world of Final Fantasy 14 over these past six
   years. Though previous expansions have always been a direct
   continuation of the main story, the scope of Shadowbringers is almost
   dizzying by comparison. Characters, lore, and story beats that have
   been left to simmer for years suddenly boil over in dramatic narrative
   twists and turns that make this 50-hour journey an absolute
   rollercoaster.

   When the hero Arbert first appeared all the way back in Heavensward as
   a minor character, for example, I never could have imagined the pivotal
   role he would grow to have in Shadowbringers. It's these long and
   meandering character arcs that make my adventures feel MMO-sized, like
   if Game of Thrones was a high-fantasy anime.

   Despite being an MMO, Shadowbringers does a remarkable job of emulating
   that golden era of JRPGs through well-written dialogue and evocative
   cutscenes. If you hate fetch quests in MMOs, Shadowbringers
   unfortunately has those in spades but I hardly cared because the
   context of those quests—and the cutscenes that often followed—were so
   enticing.

   Shadowbringers' eclectic cast is one of its best strengths.

     Emet Selch could easily be the best nemesis of any Final Fantasy
     game since FF6's Kekfa.

   The writing and voice acting has been steadily improving since A Realm
   Reborn, but the bleakness of Shadowbringers casts the drama in a much
   more mature, and at times disturbing, new light. One early quest led me
   to a sanitorium full of people who had been infected with the light
   and, in time, would turn into Sin Eaters. Without a cure, the
   caretakers' only option was to delay the inevitable and then euthanize
   them. Elsewhere, the city Eulmore is full of upper-class elite living
   in excess as they wait for the impending apocalypse while, just outside
   the walls, the poor, sick, and starving waste away.

   Shadowbringers addresses these heavy subjects well in the face of Final
   Fantasy's extensive melodrama, but my favorite part of the story is how
   much depth it adds to my cast of longtime companions. Thancred's story
   is especially gut-wrenching and brings a bittersweet end to one of
   FF14's longest character arcs.

   Even better was Shadowbringers' ploy to have the MMO's grand villain,
   Emet Selch, tag along for most of the adventure. Few stories ever
   manage to make me sympathize with a villain while still retaining what
   makes them detestable, but Emet Selch could be the best Final Fantasy
   nemesis since FF6's Kekfa. He's batshit crazy but so charismatic and
   likeable that I wish we didn't have to be enemies.

Black in action

   Though its story is the best reason to play, Shadowbringers adds a lot
   of other neat features. The new Gunbreaker and Dancer are both fun new
   jobs (FF14 parlance for classes) that each have a distinct playstyle
   and the new bunny-like Vi and tiger-esque Hrothgar character races are
   natural additions to the world (though I hate how many bikini-clad Vi
   I'm seeing everywhere now).

   (Image credit: Square Enix)

   These features are less exciting only because they so closely follow
   the same template that Square Enix has laid out since Heavensward.
   Instead of overhauling core game systems with each expansion like World
   of Warcraft, Final Fantasy 14 tends to play it safe. While that makes
   the addition of new jobs, raids, and other features feel somewhat
   predictable, I don't mind since everything is consistently good and
   fun—especially the new dungeons, which are some of my favorite out of
   any expansion so far.

   The story tees up each dungeon and single-boss raid (called Trials) so
   well, turning each one into a climactic finale for each zone-specific
   questline. After spending so long in the barren, gritty deserts of
   Stormblood's areas, the dungeons and zones of Shadowbringers are a
   visual feast. Il Mheg and its accompanying dungeon of Dohn Mheg are my
   two favorites.

   The former is an entire area stripped straight out of The Dark Crystal,
   an enchanting land full of playful fairies and a colony of talking
   dog-birds ruled over by a fairy king who also happens to be a Sin
   Eater. To supplant her, I had to complete the dungeon of Dohn Mheg, a
   vibrant underwater dreamland ruled over by a top-hat wearing frog
   spirit.

   It's unlike anything else in Final Fantasy 14, but instead of clashing
   with the bleak story of Shadowbringers' other areas, it ends up being a
   welcome reprieve capped off with a grueling battle against the fairy
   king herself. Shadowbringers continues FF14's legacy for astounding
   music and flashy spell effects that make each boss fight memorable and
   thrilling.

   If there's one area that Final Fantasy 14 is struggling with, it's in
   job balance and design, though. Shadowbringers reworked nearly every
   job, pruning old abilities while also adding some new ones. Most of the
   damage-dealing jobs are improved by these changes, but as a White Mage
   it's disappointing to see some of my favorite spells taken away and
   replaced with a new healing system that doesn't add any complexity to
   combat. Instead, I'm just waiting for a meter to slowly fill so I can
   cast the associated spell.

   That isn't to say combat in Shadowbringers isn't fun. Shadowbringers'
   new raid bosses are still the best out of any MMO—demanding excellent
   team coordination while delivering an explosive spectacle that makes
   each fight feel tense and exciting.

   Since Final Fantasy 14 relaunched six years ago, Square Enix has also
   kept up a good tempo of major updates every three or four months.
   Assuming Shadowbringers continues that template I'm excited to see
   where it goes next. But its main story is already so good that
   Shadowbringers is worth playing even if you have no intention of
   committing hundreds of more hours grinding raid bosses for loot drops.
   Final Fantasy 14 is quietly one of the best games in the series, but
   Shadowbringers elevates it even further by telling a bleak and
   heartfelt tale that generously rewards the investment made by its most
   hardcore fans.

Our Verdict

   A flexible roguelike with more than enough playstyles to keep you
   coming back.

Need to Know

   What is it? A chaotic rogue-like with endless player choice.
   Expect to pay: $20 / £15.50
   Developer: Matt Dabrowski
   Publisher: tinyBuild
   Reviewed on: i7-7700HQ, GTX 1050Ti, 8GB RAM
   Multiplayer: Up to four-player co-op, both online and local
   Link: Official Site

   On my first run, I'm an assassin, backstabbing enemies and slinging
   shuriken. Then I'm a jock, barrelling through walls and swinging a
   baseball bat. Next, I'm a gorilla, flanked by three other primates,
   tearing scientists apart with my bare hands in the middle of downtown.
   Somehow, I avoid the patrolling cops on that last one, probably because
   I’d injected two of my companions with an invisibility serum—plus,
   there was a riot in the streets, turning the level into a mosh pit of
   gang fights, enraged shop owners, and firefighters whacking office
   workers with axes.

   In the brilliant, bananas 2D roguelike Streets of Rogue, you play as
   one of 26 characters, killing targets and stealing macguffins from
   guarded buildings. After you finish all your missions you take the
   elevator to the next procedurally-generated floor, and keep going until
   you die or reach the end. Missions are formulaic and repeat often, and
   the world doesn’t feel all that different between stages despite a few
   new buildings and NPC types, but what makes Streets of Rogue special,
   and unpredictable, is the unique traits of each character, which
   constantly create new, surprising interactions with the world.

Cannibals and vampires

   Streets of Rogue is designed in the style of an immersive sim, in that
   each character has multiple ways to approach any given situation. As
   the hacker, I’m asked to kill a member of the blue gang, the Crepes.
   He’s surrounded by buddies, and as a scrawny nerd I’m no good with my
   fists or a pistol. There are no nearby turrets I can program to target
   him and no computers to blow up in his face, which are two of my usual
   tricks. Instead, I hire him as a bodyguard for the rest of the level,
   walk to the other side of town, and dive into a den of red gang Blahds,
   who gun him down without blinking. Job done.

   After a zombie infestation special event cuts that run short, I choose
   the cannibal, who regenerates health by munching corpses. On the third
   floor, I have to steal a wallet from a chest in the back room of a bar.
   But bartenders don’t like cannibals, and if I try to walk in I’ll be
   bounced out by him and his customers. I could blow a hole in the wall
   with a grenade, but everyone outside will see. Instead, I pour a vial
   of a mystery liquid into the air filtration system, which saps their
   strength. I burst through the door and beat them bloody, gorge on their
   bodies, and help myself to the wallet, ignoring the wailing camera on
   the wall.

     It’s a build-your-own roguelike, basically, and you can make it as
     hard or as easy as you like.

   As well as randomised missions, each character has their own optional
   ‘big quest’, and if you complete its task on each of a run’s 15 levels
   you receive a new permanent ability for that class. They’re often the
   highlight of a run. The bartender has to make and serve three drinks to
   different NPCs on each level, and each recipe has its own effect on the
   drinker, enraging them, poisoning them, or making them super fast. The
   firefighter’s big quest is to extinguish fires set by arsonists, who
   only appear if you choose that character.

   These quests, and the unique traits of each character, make picking a
   new class feel like playing a completely different game. With the
   assassin, who can go invisible and chain stab enemies, I’m playing a
   slow-burn stealth game. With the soldier and their machinegun, it’s a
   top-down shooter. Streets of Rogue is not groundbreaking as either, but
   being able to choose between 26 different playstyles makes it hard to
   stop playing. I still have a handful of characters to unlock, including
   a vampire who must kill a hidden werewolf on each level.

   And after 15 hours, I’m still finding new ways to use characters I
   thought I’d mastered. I only just realised, for example, that hackers
   can hack fridges to make them literally ‘run’ (geddit?), flattening
   anyone in their path and then bursting open to reveal the food inside,
   which restores HP. I also just discovered eating burnt bodies restores
   more HP as the cannibal, so I buy a flamethrower whenever I can.

Mutations

   Even if you stick with one character, each run takes on its own
   personality thanks to the items you find in shops, chests and safes, as
   well as the traits you pick up between levels. Finishing a floor lets
   you choose a trait from a list of three, and you can push for a
   specific playstyle by picking traits that match. I pair a trait that
   lets me recruit extra followers with one that gives followers more
   health to start a roving gang that can win almost any fight.

   Streets of Rogue also boasts a huge list of custom rules, called
   mutators, that you can toggle on and off, and you can decide exactly
   which traits and items appear in the unlock pool. It’s a build-your-own
   roguelike, basically, and you can make it as hard or as easy as you
   like. After a series of slower runs I turned on bigger bullets,
   exploding bodies, and faster move speed. It’s utter chaos.

     I’m off to see how exactly how much damage a comedian can do if you
     give them a rocket launcher, infinite ammo and an inventory full of
     bacon cheeseburgers.

   There are a few things I find bothersome. Commanding your companions is
   fiddly, but if you don’t micromanage them they’ll run off and get
   themselves killed. It’s too easy to get into buildings by knocking on
   the door, waiting for the person to answer and ducking inside as soon
   as they turn around. As I mentioned, the levels are uninspiring—each
   three-floor stage has a different skin, but the changes never really
   affect the action. And the four-player co-op isn’t much fun with
   strangers because distractions scatter players in different
   directions.

   The inclusion of slavery feels entirely out of place, too. Most levels
   have slavemasters that you can buy slaves from, and you can unlock the
   slavemaster as a playable character. In a game with a caricatured world
   where chicken nuggets are a black market currency, the inclusion of
   slavery is jarring, especially when the slaves make jokes (“Hey,
   remember when you literally owned me? Wow, those were the days…”).

   Those sticking points aside, Streets of Rogue is absolutely worth
   playing, and once you start, it’s hard to stop. It gives you more
   freedom than almost any roguelike, and its varied cast of characters,
   combined with the randomness of traits and mutators, mean no two runs
   play out the same way.

   Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m off to see how exactly how much damage a
   comedian can do if you give them a rocket launcher, infinite ammo and
   an inventory full of bacon cheeseburgers.

Dicey Dungeons review

Dicey Dungeons forges one RNG to rule them all.

Our Verdict

   Endearing, compulsive, and just weird enough to want to keep exploring.

Need to know

   What is it? A crossbreed of CCG and roguelike dungeon-crawling.
   Expect to pay: $15/£11.39
   Developer: Terry Cavanagh
   Publisher: Terry Cavanagh
   Reviewed on: i5 6500, RTX 2080 TI, 32GB RAM
   Multiplayer? None
   Link: Official site

   Dicey Dungeons rolls you a few dice, presents you with cards which
   harness those dice in damage-dealing or character-buffing fashion, and
   pits you against a series of opponents in an offbeat dungeon-crawling
   RPG setting. It feels vaguely like playing a CCG while wearing x-ray
   specs.

   The roguelikes and card games Dicey Dungeons is referencing with its
   art and design would hide away their RNG elements, but Terry Cavanagh’s
   new game puts the dice under a spotlight. Quite literally: the setup is
   that of a gameshow, so while you’re fighting sneezy hedgehogs and
   sharply dressed hammerhead sharks there’s a studio audience gasping and
   cheering over it all. They ooh and aah when you open chests in its
   simple dungeon maps. There’s even a wheel of fortune. Those disparate
   elements—rolling dice, D&D-inspired questing, and the gameshows of
   yesteryear—shouldn’t gel together, but somehow it all feels like the
   most natural thing in the world while you’re playing.

   Cavanagh’s previous games, VVVVVV and Super Hexagon, were about
   attritional runs against a conceptually simple but supremely demanding
   challenge. This—well, this is not. It’s actually all rather friendly,
   starting you off with a tutorial and building on itself very gradually
   with each encounter. And sure, rolling two dice and dragging them over
   into two weapon card slots to deal damage might not sound captivating
   on paper, but every new element it introduces makes you stop for a
   second and re-evaluate where this is all leading.

   Within the opening hour you’re dealing out shock, fire, and freezing
   damage, locking opponents’ dice, and firing off double-attacks when
   your limit break bar fills up from taking damage. And crucially, you
   feel like some kind of mastermind tactician while you do it.

   That’s the trick in Dicey Dungeons. You’re always being given the
   chance to make a smart decision, whether it’s holding off on doing
   damage to pool some dice into a healing card—these are activated on
   hitting a certain high number, say 16—or using buffs to hit exact
   numbers required by status effect cards. I’m convinced there’s still
   another layer of RNG beneath the hood that makes for the most
   entertaining fights—I mean, the Loud Bird I encountered at level 5
   rolled one double, an even and two dice under 5 every round when I
   fought him—but with the information you have, there are always
   opportunities to pull off something that feels clever.

     At some point you’re certain to pause and wonder how you ended up
     putting such brainpower into the meta of a chirpy cartoon dice game.

   At the end of each dungeon run is a boss and a new unlockable
   character. Bosses offer surprisingly little challenge though, and are
   sometimes outmatched by one or two of the enemies you had to best on
   the way to them. It's unusually lenient from the developer who made
   surviving for ten seconds in Super Hexagon feel like a
   once-in-a-lifetime feat of skill. Nevertheless, with the boss roasted
   and a new character for the taking, it’s back to the dungeons for a
   series of ever-escalating challenges.

   There’s a deceptively massive chunk of game here, and if the likes of
   Hearthstone or Gwent never clicked with you it’s an easy way to slide
   into the world of agonising over deck builds. You only have space for a
   handful of cards, but striking the right balance between attack,
   defense, and modifiers is just as engrossing. At some point you’re
   certain to pause and wonder how you ended up putting such brainpower
   into the meta of a chirpy cartoon dice game.

   Like an over-eager Tinder date, the vibe is very much casual and
   lighthearted at first, but before too long you’re made aware that the
   expectation is absolutely that of a long-term prospect. Unlike a
   stranger you swiped on the internet though, Dicey Dungeons doesn’t keep
   liking your Instagram posts months after you stop playing it.

   And, to jettison that analogy entirely before it’s stretched well
   beyond its limit, it does a surprisingly good job of world-building.
   When you fight a Baby Squid, its attacks involve squirting ink which
   blinds you to some of your dice. Hedgehogs use a lot of spikes. The
   aforementioned Loud Bird uses sound to its advantage. This is all via
   the medium of dice rolls, you understand, but it’s easy to be pulled
   into the surreal ‘90s cartoon-like world just the same.

   Longer term play is limited by the absence of multiplayer, but as a
   slice of solo deck-building Dicey Dungeons is engrossing, not to
   mention buoyed by great art and presentation. I do feel that faint itch
   to just load up Gwent and tend to my decks there instead when I play,
   but Gwent doesn’t look anywhere near as much like Ren & Stimpy as this.
