Abstract

   This work estimates the energy embedded in wasted food annually in the
   United States. We calculated the energy intensity of food production
   from agriculture, transportation, processing, food sales, storage, and
   preparation for 2007 as 8080 ± 760 trillion BTU. In 1995 approximately
   27% of edible food was wasted. Synthesizing these food loss figures
   with our estimate of energy consumption for different food categories
   and food production steps, while normalizing for different production
   volumes, shows that 2030 ± 160 trillion BTU of energy were embedded in
   wasted food in 2007. The energy embedded in wasted food represents
   approximately 2% of annual energy consumption in the United States,
   which is substantial when compared to other energy conservation and
   production proposals. To improve this analysis, nationwide estimates of
   food waste and an updated estimate for the energy required to produce
   food for U.S. consumption would be valuable.

Abstract

   The protective effect of proanthocyanidins from persimmon peel, using
   both oligomers and polymers, was investigated in a db/db type 2
   diabetes model. Male db/db mice were divided into three groups: control
   (vehicle), polymer-, or oligomer- (10 mg/(kg body weight·day·p.o.))
   administered mice. Age-matched nondiabetic m/m mice were used as a
   normal group. The administration of proanthocyanidins reduced
   hyperglycemia in db/db mice through a decline in the serum level of
   glucose and glycosylated protein. In addition, it had a strong effect
   on hyperlipidemia through lowering levels of triglyceride, total
   cholesterol, and nonesterified fatty acids. The protective effect
   against hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia was greater in the groups
   administered the oligomeric rather than polymeric form. The increased
   oxidative stress in db/db mice was attenuated by the administration of
   oligomers through inhibiting the generation of reactive oxygen species
   and lipid peroxidation and elevating the reduced glutathione/oxidized
   glutathione ratio. On the other hand, polymers did not show such an
   effect. Moreover, expressions in the liver of sterol regulatory element
   binding protein (SREBP)-1 and SREBP-2 were downregulated by the
   administration of proanthocyanidins, especially the oligomeric form.
   Oligomers caused a slight elevation in the expression of peroxisome
   proliferator-activated receptors α. Furthermore, oligomeric
   proanthocyanidin regulated the expression of nuclear factor κB in db/db
   type 2 diabetes via the activation of inhibitor protein κB-α. It also
   attenuated the protein expressions of cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible
   nitric oxide synthase. This suggests that oligomers would act as a
   regulator in inflammatory reactions associated with oxidative stress in
   type 2 diabetes. The present study results suggest that
   proanthocyanidin administration, especially the oligomeric form, may
   improve oxidative stress via the regulation of hyperlipidemia than
   hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes.

Abstract

   Abstract Image

   Demand for high-volume, short duration water withdrawals could create
   water stress to aquatic organisms in Fayetteville Shale streams sourced
   for hydraulic fracturing fluids. We estimated potential water stress
   using permitted water withdrawal volumes and actual water withdrawals
   compared to monthly median, low, and high streamflows. Risk for
   biological stress was considered at 20% of long-term median and 10% of
   high- and low-flow thresholds. Future well build-out projections
   estimated potential for continued stress. Most water was permitted from
   small, free-flowing streams and “frack” ponds (dammed streams).
   Permitted 12-h pumping volumes exceeded median streamflow at 50% of
   withdrawal sites in June, when flows were low. Daily water usage, from
   operator disclosures, compared to median streamflow showed possible
   water stress in 7–51% of catchments from June–November, respectively.
   If 100% of produced water was recycled, per-well water use declined by
   25%, reducing threshold exceedance by 10%. Future water stress was
   predicted to occur in fewer catchments important for drinking water and
   species of conservation concern due to the decline in new well
   installations and increased use of recycled water. Accessible and
   precise withdrawal and streamflow data are critical moving forward to
   assess and mitigate water stress in streams that experience high-volume
   withdrawals.

Abstract

   Abstract Image

   Pollution of the environment with plastic debris is a significant and
   rapidly expanding threat to biodiversity due to its abundance,
   durability, and persistence. Current knowledge of the negative effects
   of debris on wildlife is largely based on consequences that are readily
   observed, such as entanglement or starvation. Many interactions with
   debris, however, result in less visible and poorly documented sublethal
   effects, and as a consequence, the true impact of plastic is
   underestimated. We investigated the sublethal effects of ingested
   plastic in Flesh-footed Shearwaters (Ardenna carneipes) using blood
   chemistry parameters as a measure of bird health. The presence of
   plastic had a significant negative effect on bird morphometrics and
   blood calcium levels and a positive relationship with the concentration
   of uric acid, cholesterol, and amylase. That we found blood chemistry
   parameters being related to plastic pollution is one of the few
   examples to date of the sublethal effects of marine debris and
   highlights that superficially healthy individuals may still experience
   the negative consequences of ingesting plastic debris. Moving beyond
   crude measures, such as reduced body mass, to physiological parameters
   will provide much needed insight into the nuanced and less visible
   effects of plastic.

Abstract

   Abstract Image

   A substantial fraction of marine plastic debris originates from
   land-based sources and rivers potentially act as a major transport
   pathway for all sizes of plastic debris. We analyzed a global
   compilation of data on plastic debris in the water column across a wide
   range of river sizes. Plastic debris loads, both microplastic
   (particles <5 mm) and macroplastic (particles >5 mm) are positively
   related to the mismanaged plastic waste (MMPW) generated in the river
   catchments. This relationship is nonlinear where large rivers with
   population-rich catchments delivering a disproportionately higher
   fraction of MMPW into the sea. The 10 top-ranked rivers transport
   88–95% of the global load into the sea. Using MMPW as a predictor we
   calculate the global plastic debris inputs form rivers into the sea to
   range between 0.41 and 4 × 10^6 t/y. Due to the limited amount of data
   high uncertainties were expected and ultimately confirmed. The
   empirical analysis to quantify plastic loads in rivers can be extended
   easily by additional potential predictors other than MMPW, for example,
   hydrological conditions.

Abstract

   This work estimates the energy embedded in wasted food annually in the
   United States. We calculated the energy intensity of food production
   from agriculture, transportation, processing, food sales, storage, and
   preparation for 2007 as 8080 ± 760 trillion BTU. In 1995 approximately
   27% of edible food was wasted. Synthesizing these food loss figures
   with our estimate of energy consumption for different food categories
   and food production steps, while normalizing for different production
   volumes, shows that 2030 ± 160 trillion BTU of energy were embedded in
   wasted food in 2007. The energy embedded in wasted food represents
   approximately 2% of annual energy consumption in the United States,
   which is substantial when compared to other energy conservation and
   production proposals. To improve this analysis, nationwide estimates of
   food waste and an updated estimate for the energy required to produce
   food for U.S. consumption would be valuable.

Abstract

   The protective effect of proanthocyanidins from persimmon peel, using
   both oligomers and polymers, was investigated in a db/db type 2
   diabetes model. Male db/db mice were divided into three groups: control
   (vehicle), polymer-, or oligomer- (10 mg/(kg body weight·day·p.o.))
   administered mice. Age-matched nondiabetic m/m mice were used as a
   normal group. The administration of proanthocyanidins reduced
   hyperglycemia in db/db mice through a decline in the serum level of
   glucose and glycosylated protein. In addition, it had a strong effect
   on hyperlipidemia through lowering levels of triglyceride, total
   cholesterol, and nonesterified fatty acids. The protective effect
   against hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia was greater in the groups
   administered the oligomeric rather than polymeric form. The increased
   oxidative stress in db/db mice was attenuated by the administration of
   oligomers through inhibiting the generation of reactive oxygen species
   and lipid peroxidation and elevating the reduced glutathione/oxidized
   glutathione ratio. On the other hand, polymers did not show such an
   effect. Moreover, expressions in the liver of sterol regulatory element
   binding protein (SREBP)-1 and SREBP-2 were downregulated by the
   administration of proanthocyanidins, especially the oligomeric form.
   Oligomers caused a slight elevation in the expression of peroxisome
   proliferator-activated receptors α. Furthermore, oligomeric
   proanthocyanidin regulated the expression of nuclear factor κB in db/db
   type 2 diabetes via the activation of inhibitor protein κB-α. It also
   attenuated the protein expressions of cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible
   nitric oxide synthase. This suggests that oligomers would act as a
   regulator in inflammatory reactions associated with oxidative stress in
   type 2 diabetes. The present study results suggest that
   proanthocyanidin administration, especially the oligomeric form, may
   improve oxidative stress via the regulation of hyperlipidemia than
   hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes.

Abstract

   Abstract Image

   Demand for high-volume, short duration water withdrawals could create
   water stress to aquatic organisms in Fayetteville Shale streams sourced
   for hydraulic fracturing fluids. We estimated potential water stress
   using permitted water withdrawal volumes and actual water withdrawals
   compared to monthly median, low, and high streamflows. Risk for
   biological stress was considered at 20% of long-term median and 10% of
   high- and low-flow thresholds. Future well build-out projections
   estimated potential for continued stress. Most water was permitted from
   small, free-flowing streams and “frack” ponds (dammed streams).
   Permitted 12-h pumping volumes exceeded median streamflow at 50% of
   withdrawal sites in June, when flows were low. Daily water usage, from
   operator disclosures, compared to median streamflow showed possible
   water stress in 7–51% of catchments from June–November, respectively.
   If 100% of produced water was recycled, per-well water use declined by
   25%, reducing threshold exceedance by 10%. Future water stress was
   predicted to occur in fewer catchments important for drinking water and
   species of conservation concern due to the decline in new well
   installations and increased use of recycled water. Accessible and
   precise withdrawal and streamflow data are critical moving forward to
   assess and mitigate water stress in streams that experience high-volume
   withdrawals.

Abstract

   Abstract Image

   Pollution of the environment with plastic debris is a significant and
   rapidly expanding threat to biodiversity due to its abundance,
   durability, and persistence. Current knowledge of the negative effects
   of debris on wildlife is largely based on consequences that are readily
   observed, such as entanglement or starvation. Many interactions with
   debris, however, result in less visible and poorly documented sublethal
   effects, and as a consequence, the true impact of plastic is
   underestimated. We investigated the sublethal effects of ingested
   plastic in Flesh-footed Shearwaters (Ardenna carneipes) using blood
   chemistry parameters as a measure of bird health. The presence of
   plastic had a significant negative effect on bird morphometrics and
   blood calcium levels and a positive relationship with the concentration
   of uric acid, cholesterol, and amylase. That we found blood chemistry
   parameters being related to plastic pollution is one of the few
   examples to date of the sublethal effects of marine debris and
   highlights that superficially healthy individuals may still experience
   the negative consequences of ingesting plastic debris. Moving beyond
   crude measures, such as reduced body mass, to physiological parameters
   will provide much needed insight into the nuanced and less visible
   effects of plastic.

Abstract

   Abstract Image

   A substantial fraction of marine plastic debris originates from
   land-based sources and rivers potentially act as a major transport
   pathway for all sizes of plastic debris. We analyzed a global
   compilation of data on plastic debris in the water column across a wide
   range of river sizes. Plastic debris loads, both microplastic
   (particles <5 mm) and macroplastic (particles >5 mm) are positively
   related to the mismanaged plastic waste (MMPW) generated in the river
   catchments. This relationship is nonlinear where large rivers with
   population-rich catchments delivering a disproportionately higher
   fraction of MMPW into the sea. The 10 top-ranked rivers transport
   88–95% of the global load into the sea. Using MMPW as a predictor we
   calculate the global plastic debris inputs form rivers into the sea to
   range between 0.41 and 4 × 10^6 t/y. Due to the limited amount of data
   high uncertainties were expected and ultimately confirmed. The
   empirical analysis to quantify plastic loads in rivers can be extended
   easily by additional potential predictors other than MMPW, for example,
   hydrological conditions.
