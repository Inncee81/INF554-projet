Digital Mannequins Are Replacing Human Models in Clothing Catalogs

Now, fashion retailers are skipping the flesh and bones, and putting their
clothes on digitally rendered mannequins

   201301280200212574521079_11237eac68_b.jpg (Stuart Heath)
   By Rose Eveleth
   smithsonian.com
   January 28, 2013

   Finding work as a model is tough. If you learn anything from America’s
   Top Model, you know that competition is fierce, nobody is there to make
   friends, and there’s a lot of crying. But now, models are competing for
   catalog gigs with computers, too. Retailers are skipping the flesh and
   bones in fashion photo shoots and putting their clothes on digitally
   rendered mannequins. The Wall Street Journal reports:

     The firm behind the technology is a Stockholm-based startup named
     Looklet, in which Vente-Privee now holds a financial stake. To
     create the virtual models, Looklet photographs their flesh-and-blood
     counterparts, breaking down the photos into arms, legs and faces, as
     well as smaller body parts like eyes and hair. Separately, it shoots
     articles of clothing on a mannequin. The people and apparel photos
     are entered into software where designers can mix and match them
     into combinations of hairstyles, skin tones, body postures, clothing
     combinations and even facial expressions.

   The results are pretty convincing. So convincing, that H&M’s customers
   were shocked to find out that the models weren’t real.

     H&M bought into the technology early. Its fake models turned out to
     be too convincing. Last year, it came under fire for not disclosing
     that the models weren’t real because, in theory, using faux people
     puts added pressure on women and men to look unrealistically
     flawless. Eating-disorder organizations criticized what they called
     unnecessary use of fake models, while bloggers told readers to sign
     letters urging H&M to use real models.

     H&M, which said it never concealed its use of virtual mannequins,
     sees advantages to the technology. “It’s a way for us to show our
     products from various angles in the same way that we show our
     outfits on display dolls in stores,” spokeswoman Camilla
     Emilsson-Falk said.

   Using this technology is saving firms something like 20 percent per
   item, according to Ilan Benhaim, the co-founder of retail store
   Vente-Privee that uses these digital mannequins. As of right now, the
   mannequins don’t extend to children or plus-sized models, but they
   will. Of course, the models are based on real humans, who still get
   paid, but you only need a few living models, to make an army of
   mannequins.

The Children’s Book That Caused Japan’s Raccoon Problem

When the story of one man’s childhood pet raccoon became a hit in 1970s
Japan, it heralded a biological invasion still troubling the country today

   Baby Raccoons (Tim Fitzharris/Minden Pictures/Corbis)
   By Laura Clark
   smithsonian.com
   March 16, 2015

   Today, raccoons are a nuisance animal in Japan, rummaging through
   trash, stealing goods from vendors, feasting on crops and even damaging
   ancient Japanese temples with their sharp claws and abundant poop. But
   their invasion started back in 1977, when the kids of Japan were going
   crazy for a cartoon raccoon named Rascal.

   He was cute and mischievous and the star of an anime series adaptation
   of a favorite children’s book, written by American author Sterling
   North. As Eric Grundhauser over at Atlas Obscura explains, the book,
   entitled Rascal: A Memoir of a Better Era, was released to western
   audiences in 1963 and told the story of North’s adventures with his
   childhood pet raccoon. Audiences ate the warm and fuzzy story right up,
   and Disney even made it a live-action movie in 1969.
   Rascal, the animated raccoon grabbed the imagination of a generation of
   Japanese kids. Rascal, the animated raccoon grabbed the imagination of
   a generation of Japanese kids. (Via Idea Wikia)

   But the book would reach a new height of fame when the story migrated
   to Japan, where the Nippon Animation Company turned it into a
   52-episode cartoon series to the delight of the nation’s children. The
   kids loved Rascal so much that they wanted raccoons to take on their
   own adventures. Soon, the Japanese were importing around 1,500 critters
   a month. But, as Grundhauser writes, “If only they had finished the
   series first.”

   You see, at the end of Sterling North’s book, he has to send Rascal
   back into nature to live as he was meant to live—not as a companion to
   humans, but as a wild animal. And that’s just what many families in
   Japan eventually found themselves doing, too. After all, though
   raccoons look like cute little cat burglars as babies, they don’t
   really make good pets.

   The Japanese government soon banned the import of raccoons as well as
   the practice of keeping them as pets, but the damage was already done.
   The descendants of the Rascal craze can be found, according to a 2004
   report, in 42 of the country’s 47 prefectures.

   Japan isn’t the only place raccoons have invaded beyond their native
   North America foraging grounds. Parts of Europe and the Caucuses have
   their own raccoon troubles thanks to imports driven by hunting and the
   fur-trade. The critters’ tendency to carry deadly diseases like rabies
   caused alarm in Spain in 2012. And in Germany that year, one city
   counted 100 raccoons per square kilometer. That’s a whole lot of
   Rascals.

   plate collides and sinks below the Philippine plate. It runs for 1,500
   miles and contains the deepest spot known in the ocean: the Challenger
   Deep, which hides 6.83 miles below the surface.

   In 2009, the United States, which owns the nearby Mariana Islands
   including Guam, set aside the area's 95,216 square miles as a Marine
   National Monument. But despite lots of research on the Trench,
   scientists still don’t have a full grasp on its geology, habitats and
   inhabitants. That’s why NOAA's Okeanos Explorer set sail last
   April, mapping and researching the area for three months. This mission
   came to an end this past weekend.

   The ship is the only federally funded research vessel assigned to
   "systematically explore our largely unknown ocean for the purpose of
   discovery and the advancement of knowledge." Using multi-beam sonar, it
   generates high-resolution images of the seafloor. When the crew spots
   an anomaly or interesting area, it deploys a fleet of remotely operated
   vehicles to explore the hydrothermal vents, seamounts and interesting
   animals in the area.

   The idea is to create a baseline of information so researchers and
   government agencies can understand how to manage and protect the Trench
   and its fish. Among the many amazing things the Okeanos team have
   seen so far are bottomfish habitats, mud volcanoes and deep-sea coral.

   The information is sure to prove invaluable for ocean researchers and
   geologists. But the more immediate impact of the expedition has been
   the release of dozens of images of the bizarre and beautiful sea
   creatures it has captured. Images of a new jellyfish species and
   a ghostly white octopus went viral and a "sponge the size of a
   minivan," the largest on record, also earned headlines.

   More recently, the ship’s ROVs spotted the first living example of a
   “ghostfish” believed to be in the family Aphyonidae. The four-inch,
   white fish with deeply recessed eyes got the researchers very excited.
   “This is just remarkable,” Bruce Mundy, fishery biologist with the NOAA
   National Marine Fisheries Service, says in a video of the find. “Some
   of us working with fish have wish lists, you know, a sort of bucket
   list of what we might want to see. And a fish in this family was
   probably first on those lists for a lot of us.”

   Other creatures found on the voyage include a sea anemone with six-foot
   tentacles, strange purple acorn worms and many strange new comb jellys
   or ctenophores.

How Artificial Intelligence Could Revolutionize Archival Museum Research

A new study shows off a computer program’s specimen-sorting prowess

   Natural History Museum teems with pressed specimens of thousands of
   distinct plants. (National Museum of Natural History)
   By Ryan P. Smith
   smithsonian.com
   November 3, 2017

   When you think of artificial intelligence, the field of botany probably
   isn't uppermost in your mind. When you picture settings for
   cutting-edge computational research, century-old museums may not top
   the list. And yet, a just-published article in the Biodiversity Data
   Journal shows that some of the most exciting and portentous innovation
   in machine learning is taking place at none other than the National
   Herbarium of the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C.

   The paper, which demonstrates that digital neural networks are capable
   of distinguishing between two similar families of plants with rates of
   accuracy well over 90 percent, implies all sorts of mouth-watering
   possibilities for scientists and academics going forward. The study
   relies on software grounded in “deep learning” algorithms, which allow
   computer programs to accrue experience in much the same way human
   experts do, upping their game each time they run. Soon, this tech
   could enable comparative analyses of millions of distinct specimens
   from all corners of the globe—a proposition which would previously have
   demanded an untenable amount of human labor.

   “This direction of research shows a great deal of promise,” says
   Stanford professor Mark Algee-Hewitt, a prominent voice in the digital
   humanities movement and assistant faculty director at the university's
   Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis. “These methods have the
   ability to give us vast amounts of information about what collections
   contain,” he says, and “in doing so they make this data accessible.”

   These new findings build on years of work undertaken at the Smithsonian
   Institution to systematically digitize its collections for academic and
   public access online, and represent a remarkable interdisciplinary
   meeting of minds: botanists, digitization experts and data scientists
   all had a part to play in bringing these results to light.

   The story starts in October 2015, when the installation of a
   camera-and-conveyor belt apparatus beneath the Natural History Museum
   vastly simplified efforts to digitize the Smithsonian’s botanical
   collection. Instead of having to manually scan every pressed flower and
   clump of grass in their repository, workers could now queue up whole
   arrays of samples, let the belt work its magic, and retrieve and
   re-catalogue them at the tail end. A three-person crew has overseen the
   belt since its debut, and they go through some 750,000 specimens each
   year. Before long, the Smithsonian's herbarium inventory, five million
   specimens strong, will be entirely online.

   Each specimen is tagged with a thorough identification card, which
   provides information on its provenance as well as essential statistical
   data. The contents of these cards have been transcribed and uploaded
   alongside the digital images, providing a comprehensive view of each
   item in the collection for those with the inclination to go searching.
   In the Smithsonian's digitized botanical archive, high-resolution
   images of specimens are paired with transcriptions of the handy ID tags
   affixed to them. In the Smithsonian's digitized botanical archive,

   “It makes our collection accessible to anyone who has a computer and an
   internet connection,” says museum botany chair Laurence Dorr, “which is
   great for answering certain questions.” Even so, Dorr found he couldn't
   shake a feeling of untapped potential. Sure, massive amounts of
   specimen data were now available to the online community, but analyzing
   it in the aggregate remained fanciful. Looking up particular specimens
   and small categories of specimens was easy enough, but Dorr wondered if
   there existed a way to leverage the data to draw conclusions
   about thousands of specimens. “What can you do with this data?” he
   recalls wondering. A man named Adam Metallo soon provided a compelling
   answer.

   Metallo, an officer with the Smithsonian’s Digitization Program Office,
   had attended a conference at which the tech giant NVIDIA—darling of PC
   gamers everywhere—was showcasing next-generation graphics processing
   units, or GPUs. Metallo was there looking for ways to improve upon the
   Smithsonian’s 3D digital rendering capabilities, but it was a largely
   unrelated nugget of information that caught his attention and stuck
   with him. In addition to generating dynamic, high-fidelity 3D visuals,
   he was told, NVIDIA’s GPUs were well-suited to big data analytics. In
   particular, beefed-up GPUs were just what was needed for intensive
   digital pattern recognition; many a machine learning algorithm had been
   optimized for the NVIDIA platform.

   Metallo was instantly intrigued. This “deep learning” technology,
   already deployed in niche sectors like self-driving car development and
   medical radiology, held great potential for the world of museums—which,
   as Metallo points out, constitutes “the biggest and oldest dataset that
   we now have access to.”

   “What does it mean for the big datasets we’re creating at the
   Smithsonian through digitization?” Metallo wanted to know. His question
   perfectly mirrored that of Laurence Dorr, and once the two connected,
   sparks began to fly. “The botany collection was one of the biggest
   collections we had most recently been working on,” Metallo remembers. A
   collaboration suggested itself.

   Whereas many forms of machine learning demand that researchers flag key
   mathematical markers in the images to be analyzed—a painstaking process
   that amounts to holding the computer’s hand—modern-day deep learning
   algorithms can teach themselves which markers to look for on the job,
   saving time and opening the door to larger-scale inquiries.
   Nevertheless, writing a Smithsonian-specific deep learning program and
   calibrating it for discrete botanical research questions was a tricky
   business—Dorr and Metallo needed the help of data scientists to make
   their vision a reality.
   Data scientists compile training specimens for the neural network
   during what Paul Frandsen remembers as Data scientists compile training
   specimens for the neural network during what Paul Frandsen remembers as
   "a cold January day." (National Museum of Natural History)

   One of the specialists they brought aboard was Smithsonian research
   data scientist Paul Frandsen, who immediately recognized the potential
   in creating an NVIDIA GPU-powered neural network to bring to bear on
   the botany collection. For Frandsen, this project symbolized a key
   first step down a wonderful and unexplored path. Soon, he says, “we’re
   going to start looking for morphological patterns on a global scale,
   and we’ll be able to answer these really big questions that would
   traditionally have taken thousands or millions of human-hours looking
   through the literature and classifying things. We’re going to be able
   to use algorithms to help us find those patterns and learn more about
   the world.”

   The just-published findings are a striking proof of concept. Generated
   by a team of nine headed up by research botanist Eric Schuettpelz and
   data scientists Paul Frandsen and Rebecca Dikow, the study aims to
   answer two large-scale questions about machine learning and the
   herbarium. The first is how effective a trained neural network can be
   at sorting mercury-stained specimens from unsullied ones. The second,
   the highlight of the paper, is how effective such a network can be at
   differentiating members of two superficially similar families of
   plants—namely, the fern ally families Lycopodiaceae and
   Selaginellaceae.

   The first trial required that the team go through thousands of
   specimens themselves in advance, noting definitively which ones were
   visibly contaminated with mercury (a vestige of outdated botanical
   preservation techniques). They wanted to be sure they knew with 100
   percent certainty which were stained and which weren’t—otherwise,
   assessing the accuracy of the program would not be possible. The team
   cherry-picked nearly 8,000 images of clean samples and 8,000 more of
   stained samples with which to train and test the computer. By the time
   they finished tweaking the neural network parameters and withdrew all
   human assistance, the algorithm was categorizing specimens it had never
   seen before with 90 percent accuracy. If the most ambiguous
   specimens—e.g., those in which staining was minimal and/or very
   faint—were thrown out, that figure rose to 94 percent.

   This result implies that deep learning software could soon help
   botanists and other scientists avoid wasting time on tedious sorting
   tasks. “The problem isn’t that a human can’t determine whether or not a
   specimen is stained with mercury,” Metallo clarifies, but rather that
   “it’s difficult to manually sort through and figure out where the
   contamination exists,” and not sensible to do so from a time management
   standpoint. Happily, machine learning could turn a major time sink into
   at most a few days of rapid automated analysis.
   Poring over specimens one at a time demands a lot of energy, and makes
   it difficult to draw large-scale conclusions. Now, big data analytics
   affords museums new ways in which to approach their collections. Poring
   over specimens one at a time demands a lot of energy, and makes it

   affords museums new ways in which to approach their collections.
   (Arnold Arboretum)

   The species discrimination portion of the study is even more exciting.
   Researchers trained and tested the neural network with roughly 9,300
   clubmoss and 9,100 spikemoss samples. As with the staining experiment,
   about 70 percent of these samples were used for initial calibration, 20
   percent were used for refinement, and the final 10 percent were used to
   formally assess accuracy. Once the code was optimized, the computer’s
   rate of success at distinguishing between the two families was 96
   percent—and a nearly perfect 99 percent if the trickiest samples were
   omitted.

   One day, Frandsen speculates, programs like this could handle
   preliminary specimen categorization at museums across the globe. “In no
   way do I think these algorithms will do anything to replace curators,”
   he is quick to note, “but instead, I think they can help curators and
   people involved in systematics to be more productive, so they can do
   their work much more quickly.”

   The neural network’s success in this study also paves the way for rapid
   testing of scientific hypotheses across massive collections. Dorr sees
   in the team’s findings the possibility of conducting
   extensive morphological comparisons of digitized samples—comparisons
   which could lead to significant scientific breakthroughs.

   This is not to say that deep learning will be a silver bullet in
   research across the board. Stanford's Mark Algee-Hewitt points out
   that “it is almost impossible to reconstruct why and how a neural
   network makes its decisions” once it has been conditioned;
   determinations left to computer programs should always be uncomplicated
   and verifiable in nature if they are to be trusted.

   “Obviously,” says Dorr, an autonomous computer program’s “not going to
   test for genetic relationships, things like that”—at least anytime in
   the near future. “But we can start to learn about distribution of
   characteristics by geographic region, or by taxonomic unit. And that’s
   going to be really powerful.”

   More than anything, this research is a jumping-off point. It is clear
   now that deep learning technology holds great promise for scientists
   and other academics all over the world, as well as the curious public
   for which they produce knowledge. What remains is rigorous follow-up
   work.

   “This is a small step,” says Frandsen, “but it’s a step that really
   tells us that these techniques can work on digitized museum specimens.
   We’re excited about setting up several more projects in the next few
   months, to try to test its limits a bit more.”

Digital Mannequins Are Replacing Human Models in Clothing Catalogs

Now, fashion retailers are skipping the flesh and bones, and putting their
clothes on digitally rendered mannequins

   201301280200212574521079_11237eac68_b.jpg (Stuart Heath)
   By Rose Eveleth
   smithsonian.com
   January 28, 2013

   Finding work as a model is tough. If you learn anything from America’s
   Top Model, you know that competition is fierce, nobody is there to make
   friends, and there’s a lot of crying. But now, models are competing for
   catalog gigs with computers, too. Retailers are skipping the flesh and
   bones in fashion photo shoots and putting their clothes on digitally
   rendered mannequins. The Wall Street Journal reports:

     The firm behind the technology is a Stockholm-based startup named
     Looklet, in which Vente-Privee now holds a financial stake. To
     create the virtual models, Looklet photographs their flesh-and-blood
     counterparts, breaking down the photos into arms, legs and faces, as
     well as smaller body parts like eyes and hair. Separately, it shoots
     articles of clothing on a mannequin. The people and apparel photos
     are entered into software where designers can mix and match them
     into combinations of hairstyles, skin tones, body postures, clothing
     combinations and even facial expressions.

   The results are pretty convincing. So convincing, that H&M’s customers
   were shocked to find out that the models weren’t real.

     H&M bought into the technology early. Its fake models turned out to
     be too convincing. Last year, it came under fire for not disclosing
     that the models weren’t real because, in theory, using faux people
     puts added pressure on women and men to look unrealistically
     flawless. Eating-disorder organizations criticized what they called
     unnecessary use of fake models, while bloggers told readers to sign
     letters urging H&M to use real models.

     H&M, which said it never concealed its use of virtual mannequins,
     sees advantages to the technology. “It’s a way for us to show our
     products from various angles in the same way that we show our
     outfits on display dolls in stores,” spokeswoman Camilla
     Emilsson-Falk said.

   Using this technology is saving firms something like 20 percent per
   item, according to Ilan Benhaim, the co-founder of retail store
   Vente-Privee that uses these digital mannequins. As of right now, the
   mannequins don’t extend to children or plus-sized models, but they
   will. Of course, the models are based on real humans, who still get
   paid, but you only need a few living models, to make an army of
   mannequins.

The Children’s Book That Caused Japan’s Raccoon Problem

When the story of one man’s childhood pet raccoon became a hit in 1970s
Japan, it heralded a biological invasion still troubling the country today

   Baby Raccoons (Tim Fitzharris/Minden Pictures/Corbis)
   By Laura Clark
   smithsonian.com
   March 16, 2015

   Today, raccoons are a nuisance animal in Japan, rummaging through
   trash, stealing goods from vendors, feasting on crops and even damaging
   ancient Japanese temples with their sharp claws and abundant poop. But
   their invasion started back in 1977, when the kids of Japan were going
   crazy for a cartoon raccoon named Rascal.

   He was cute and mischievous and the star of an anime series adaptation
   of a favorite children’s book, written by American author Sterling
   North. As Eric Grundhauser over at Atlas Obscura explains, the book,
   entitled Rascal: A Memoir of a Better Era, was released to western
   audiences in 1963 and told the story of North’s adventures with his
   childhood pet raccoon. Audiences ate the warm and fuzzy story right up,
   and Disney even made it a live-action movie in 1969.
   Rascal, the animated raccoon grabbed the imagination of a generation of
   Japanese kids. Rascal, the animated raccoon grabbed the imagination of
   a generation of Japanese kids. (Via Idea Wikia)

   But the book would reach a new height of fame when the story migrated
   to Japan, where the Nippon Animation Company turned it into a
   52-episode cartoon series to the delight of the nation’s children. The
   kids loved Rascal so much that they wanted raccoons to take on their
   own adventures. Soon, the Japanese were importing around 1,500 critters
   a month. But, as Grundhauser writes, “If only they had finished the
   series first.”

   You see, at the end of Sterling North’s book, he has to send Rascal
   back into nature to live as he was meant to live—not as a companion to
   humans, but as a wild animal. And that’s just what many families in
   Japan eventually found themselves doing, too. After all, though
   raccoons look like cute little cat burglars as babies, they don’t
   really make good pets.

   The Japanese government soon banned the import of raccoons as well as
   the practice of keeping them as pets, but the damage was already done.
   The descendants of the Rascal craze can be found, according to a 2004
   report, in 42 of the country’s 47 prefectures.

   Japan isn’t the only place raccoons have invaded beyond their native
   North America foraging grounds. Parts of Europe and the Caucuses have
   their own raccoon troubles thanks to imports driven by hunting and the
   fur-trade. The critters’ tendency to carry deadly diseases like rabies
   caused alarm in Spain in 2012. And in Germany that year, one city
   counted 100 raccoons per square kilometer. That’s a whole lot of
   Rascals.

Mission to Mariana Trench Records Dozens of Crazy Deep Sea Creatures

The Okeanos Explorer has spent three months mapping the seafloor and
recording deep sea life in the ocean’s depths

   By Jason Daley
   smithsonian.com
   July 11, 2016

   The Mariana Trench is one of the most enigmatic spots in the ocean.
   This crescent-shaped scar in the Earth’s crust forms where the Pacific
   plate collides and sinks below the Philippine plate. It runs for 1,500
   miles and contains the deepest spot known in the ocean: the Challenger
   Deep, which hides 6.83 miles below the surface.

   including Guam, set aside the area's 95,216 square miles as a Marine
   National Monument. But despite lots of research on the Trench,
   scientists still don’t have a full grasp on its geology, habitats and
   inhabitants. That’s why NOAA's Okeanos Explorer set sail last
   April, mapping and researching the area for three months. This mission
   came to an end this past weekend.

   The ship is the only federally funded research vessel assigned to
   "systematically explore our largely unknown ocean for the purpose of
   discovery and the advancement of knowledge." Using multi-beam sonar, it
   generates high-resolution images of the seafloor. When the crew spots
   an anomaly or interesting area, it deploys a fleet of remotely operated
   vehicles to explore the hydrothermal vents, seamounts and interesting
   animals in the area.

   The idea is to create a baseline of information so researchers and
   government agencies can understand how to manage and protect the Trench
   and its fish. Among the many amazing things the Okeanos team have
   seen so far are bottomfish habitats, mud volcanoes and deep-sea coral.

   The information is sure to prove invaluable for ocean researchers and
   geologists. But the more immediate impact of the expedition has been
   the release of dozens of images of the bizarre and beautiful sea
   creatures it has captured. Images of a new jellyfish species and
   a ghostly white octopus went viral and a "sponge the size of a
   minivan," the largest on record, also earned headlines.

   More recently, the ship’s ROVs spotted the first living example of a
   “ghostfish” believed to be in the family Aphyonidae. The four-inch,
   white fish with deeply recessed eyes got the researchers very excited.
   “This is just remarkable,” Bruce Mundy, fishery biologist with the NOAA
   National Marine Fisheries Service, says in a video of the find. “Some
   of us working with fish have wish lists, you know, a sort of bucket
   list of what we might want to see. And a fish in this family was
   probably first on those lists for a lot of us.”

   Other creatures found on the voyage include a sea anemone with six-foot
   tentacles, strange purple acorn worms and many strange new comb jellys
   or ctenophores.

How Artificial Intelligence Could Revolutionize Archival Museum Research

A new study shows off a computer program’s specimen-sorting prowess

   Natural History Museum teems with pressed specimens of thousands of
   distinct plants. (National Museum of Natural History)
   By Ryan P. Smith
   smithsonian.com
   November 3, 2017

   When you think of artificial intelligence, the field of botany probably
   isn't uppermost in your mind. When you picture settings for
   cutting-edge computational research, century-old museums may not top
   the list. And yet, a just-published article in the Biodiversity Data
   Journal shows that some of the most exciting and portentous innovation
   in machine learning is taking place at none other than the National
   Herbarium of the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C.

   The paper, which demonstrates that digital neural networks are capable
   of distinguishing between two similar families of plants with rates of
   accuracy well over 90 percent, implies all sorts of mouth-watering
   possibilities for scientists and academics going forward. The study
   relies on software grounded in “deep learning” algorithms, which allow
   computer programs to accrue experience in much the same way human
   experts do, upping their game each time they run. Soon, this tech
   could enable comparative analyses of millions of distinct specimens
   from all corners of the globe—a proposition which would previously have
   demanded an untenable amount of human labor.

   “This direction of research shows a great deal of promise,” says
   Stanford professor Mark Algee-Hewitt, a prominent voice in the digital
   humanities movement and assistant faculty director at the university's
   Center for Spatial and Textual Analysis. “These methods have the
   ability to give us vast amounts of information about what collections
   contain,” he says, and “in doing so they make this data accessible.”

   These new findings build on years of work undertaken at the Smithsonian
   Institution to systematically digitize its collections for academic and
   public access online, and represent a remarkable interdisciplinary
   meeting of minds: botanists, digitization experts and data scientists
   all had a part to play in bringing these results to light.

   The story starts in October 2015, when the installation of a
   camera-and-conveyor belt apparatus beneath the Natural History Museum
   vastly simplified efforts to digitize the Smithsonian’s botanical
   collection. Instead of having to manually scan every pressed flower and
   clump of grass in their repository, workers could now queue up whole
   arrays of samples, let the belt work its magic, and retrieve and
   re-catalogue them at the tail end. A three-person crew has overseen the
   belt since its debut, and they go through some 750,000 specimens each
   year. Before long, the Smithsonian's herbarium inventory, five million
   specimens strong, will be entirely online.

   Each specimen is tagged with a thorough identification card, which
   provides information on its provenance as well as essential statistical
   data. The contents of these cards have been transcribed and uploaded
   alongside the digital images, providing a comprehensive view of each
   item in the collection for those with the inclination to go searching.
   In the Smithsonian's digitized botanical archive, high-resolution
   images of specimens are paired with transcriptions of the handy ID tags
   affixed to them. In the Smithsonian's digitized botanical archive,

   “It makes our collection accessible to anyone who has a computer and an
   internet connection,” says museum botany chair Laurence Dorr, “which is
   great for answering certain questions.” Even so, Dorr found he couldn't
   shake a feeling of untapped potential. Sure, massive amounts of
   specimen data were now available to the online community, but analyzing
   it in the aggregate remained fanciful. Looking up particular specimens
   and small categories of specimens was easy enough, but Dorr wondered if
   there existed a way to leverage the data to draw conclusions
   about thousands of specimens. “What can you do with this data?” he
   recalls wondering. A man named Adam Metallo soon provided a compelling
   answer.

   Metallo, an officer with the Smithsonian’s Digitization Program Office,
   had attended a conference at which the tech giant NVIDIA—darling of PC
   gamers everywhere—was showcasing next-generation graphics processing
   units, or GPUs. Metallo was there looking for ways to improve upon the
   Smithsonian’s 3D digital rendering capabilities, but it was a largely
   unrelated nugget of information that caught his attention and stuck
   with him. In addition to generating dynamic, high-fidelity 3D visuals,
   he was told, NVIDIA’s GPUs were well-suited to big data analytics. In
   particular, beefed-up GPUs were just what was needed for intensive
   digital pattern recognition; many a machine learning algorithm had been
   optimized for the NVIDIA platform.

   Metallo was instantly intrigued. This “deep learning” technology,
   already deployed in niche sectors like self-driving car development and
   medical radiology, held great potential for the world of museums—which,
   as Metallo points out, constitutes “the biggest and oldest dataset that
   we now have access to.”

   “What does it mean for the big datasets we’re creating at the
   Smithsonian through digitization?” Metallo wanted to know. His question
   perfectly mirrored that of Laurence Dorr, and once the two connected,
   sparks began to fly. “The botany collection was one of the biggest
   collections we had most recently been working on,” Metallo remembers. A
   collaboration suggested itself.

   Whereas many forms of machine learning demand that researchers flag key
   mathematical markers in the images to be analyzed—a painstaking process
   that amounts to holding the computer’s hand—modern-day deep learning
   algorithms can teach themselves which markers to look for on the job,
   saving time and opening the door to larger-scale inquiries.
   Nevertheless, writing a Smithsonian-specific deep learning program and
   calibrating it for discrete botanical research questions was a tricky
   business—Dorr and Metallo needed the help of data scientists to make
   their vision a reality.
   Data scientists compile training specimens for the neural network
   during what Paul Frandsen remembers as Data scientists compile training
   specimens for the neural network during what Paul Frandsen remembers as
   "a cold January day." (National Museum of Natural History)

   One of the specialists they brought aboard was Smithsonian research
   data scientist Paul Frandsen, who immediately recognized the potential
   in creating an NVIDIA GPU-powered neural network to bring to bear on
   the botany collection. For Frandsen, this project symbolized a key
   first step down a wonderful and unexplored path. Soon, he says, “we’re
   going to start looking for morphological patterns on a global scale,
   and we’ll be able to answer these really big questions that would
   traditionally have taken thousands or millions of human-hours looking
   through the literature and classifying things. We’re going to be able
   to use algorithms to help us find those patterns and learn more about
   the world.”

   The just-published findings are a striking proof of concept. Generated
   by a team of nine headed up by research botanist Eric Schuettpelz and
   data scientists Paul Frandsen and Rebecca Dikow, the study aims to
   answer two large-scale questions about machine learning and the
   herbarium. The first is how effective a trained neural network can be
   at sorting mercury-stained specimens from unsullied ones. The second,
   the highlight of the paper, is how effective such a network can be at
   differentiating members of two superficially similar families of
   plants—namely, the fern ally families Lycopodiaceae and
   Selaginellaceae.

   The first trial required that the team go through thousands of
   specimens themselves in advance, noting definitively which ones were
   visibly contaminated with mercury (a vestige of outdated botanical
   preservation techniques). They wanted to be sure they knew with 100
   percent certainty which were stained and which weren’t—otherwise,
   assessing the accuracy of the program would not be possible. The team
   cherry-picked nearly 8,000 images of clean samples and 8,000 more of
   stained samples with which to train and test the computer. By the time
   they finished tweaking the neural network parameters and withdrew all
   human assistance, the algorithm was categorizing specimens it had never
   seen before with 90 percent accuracy. If the most ambiguous
   specimens—e.g., those in which staining was minimal and/or very
   faint—were thrown out, that figure rose to 94 percent.

   This result implies that deep learning software could soon help
   botanists and other scientists avoid wasting time on tedious sorting
   tasks. “The problem isn’t that a human can’t determine whether or not a
   specimen is stained with mercury,” Metallo clarifies, but rather that
   “it’s difficult to manually sort through and figure out where the
   contamination exists,” and not sensible to do so from a time management
   standpoint. Happily, machine learning could turn a major time sink into
   at most a few days of rapid automated analysis.
   Poring over specimens one at a time demands a lot of energy, and makes
   it difficult to draw large-scale conclusions. Now, big data analytics
   affords museums new ways in which to approach their collections. Poring
   over specimens one at a time demands a lot of energy, and makes it

   affords museums new ways in which to approach their collections.
   (Arnold Arboretum)

   The species discrimination portion of the study is even more exciting.
   Researchers trained and tested the neural network with roughly 9,300
   clubmoss and 9,100 spikemoss samples. As with the staining experiment,
   about 70 percent of these samples were used for initial calibration, 20
   percent were used for refinement, and the final 10 percent were used to
   formally assess accuracy. Once the code was optimized, the computer’s
   rate of success at distinguishing between the two families was 96
   percent—and a nearly perfect 99 percent if the trickiest samples were
   omitted.

   One day, Frandsen speculates, programs like this could handle
   preliminary specimen categorization at museums across the globe. “In no
   way do I think these algorithms will do anything to replace curators,”
   he is quick to note, “but instead, I think they can help curators and
   people involved in systematics to be more productive, so they can do
   their work much more quickly.”

   The neural network’s success in this study also paves the way for rapid
   testing of scientific hypotheses across massive collections. Dorr sees
   in the team’s findings the possibility of conducting
   extensive morphological comparisons of digitized samples—comparisons
   which could lead to significant scientific breakthroughs.

   This is not to say that deep learning will be a silver bullet in
   research across the board. Stanford's Mark Algee-Hewitt points out
   that “it is almost impossible to reconstruct why and how a neural
   network makes its decisions” once it has been conditioned;
   determinations left to computer programs should always be uncomplicated
   and verifiable in nature if they are to be trusted.

   “Obviously,” says Dorr, an autonomous computer program’s “not going to
   test for genetic relationships, things like that”—at least anytime in
   the near future. “But we can start to learn about distribution of
   characteristics by geographic region, or by taxonomic unit. And that’s
   going to be really powerful.”

   More than anything, this research is a jumping-off point. It is clear
   now that deep learning technology holds great promise for scientists
   and other academics all over the world, as well as the curious public
   for which they produce knowledge. What remains is rigorous follow-up
   work.

   “This is a small step,” says Frandsen, “but it’s a step that really
   tells us that these techniques can work on digitized museum specimens.
   We’re excited about setting up several more projects in the next few
   months, to try to test its limits a bit more.”
