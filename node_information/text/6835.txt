   GRAVITY is the second-generation VLTI instrument for precision
   narrow-angle astrometry and interferometric imaging. It will bring the
   most advanced vision to the VLT: with its fiber-fed integrated optics,
   wavefront sensors, fringe tracker, beam stabilization, and a novel
   metrology concept, GRAVITY will push the sensitivity and accuracy far
   beyond what is offered today. Providing precision astrometry of order
   ten microarcseconds, and imaging with four milliarcsecond resolution,
   GRAVITY will revolutionize dynamical measurements of celestial objects:
   it will probe physics close to the event horizon of the Galactic Center
   black hole, unambiguously detect and measure the mass of black holes in
   massive star clusters throughout the Milky Way, uncover the details of
   mass –accretion and jets in young stellar objects and active galactic
   nuclei, and probe the motion of binary stars, exoplanets and young
   stellar disks.

   Animation of the path an incoming light ray traces through the GRAVITY
   instrument. Note the intricate design and complex interaction of the
   various components for the four telescopes. For interferometry to work,
   the light paths have to be superposed with a precision of a fraction of
   the wavelength – less than 1 micrometre.

   Testing GR Near Massive Black Hole

Testing GR Near Massive Black Hole

   July 26, 2018

   Observations of the Galactic Centre team at the Max Planck Institute
   for Extraterrestrial Physics (MPE) have for the first time revealed the
   effects predicted by Einstein’s general relativity on the motion of a
   star passing through the extreme gravitational field near the
   supermassive black hole in the centre of the Milky Way. This
   long-sought result represents the climax of a 26-year-long observation
   campaign using ESO’s telescopes in Chile. more
   The ideal black hole laboratory

The ideal black hole laboratory

   June 21, 2016

   A team of European astronomers has achieved a crucial milestone for
   testing Einstein's theory of general relativity with the closest
   supermassive black hole in the centre of our own galaxy. For the first
   time, the newly installed GRAVITY instrument has been used together
   with ESO's Very Large 8m Telescopes to observe a star orbiting the
   black hole on a period as short as 16 years. Both the target star and a
   reference star nearby show no signs of being binaries – making future
   measurements much less complex.

   Animation of the path an incoming light ray traces through the GRAVITY
   instrument. Note the intricate design and complex interaction of the
   various components for the four telescopes. For interferometry to work,
   the light paths have to be superposed with a precision of a fraction of
   the wavelength – less than 1 micrometre.

   Testing GR Near Massive Black Hole

Testing GR Near Massive Black Hole

   July 26, 2018

   Observations of the Galactic Centre team at the Max Planck Institute
   for Extraterrestrial Physics (MPE) have for the first time revealed the
   effects predicted by Einstein’s general relativity on the motion of a
   star passing through the extreme gravitational field near the
   supermassive black hole in the centre of the Milky Way. This
   long-sought result represents the climax of a 26-year-long observation
   campaign using ESO’s telescopes in Chile. more
   The ideal black hole laboratory

The ideal black hole laboratory

   June 21, 2016

   A team of European astronomers has achieved a crucial milestone for
   testing Einstein's theory of general relativity with the closest
   supermassive black hole in the centre of our own galaxy. For the first
   time, the newly installed GRAVITY instrument has been used together
   with ESO's Very Large 8m Telescopes to observe a star orbiting the
   black hole on a period as short as 16 years. Both the target star and a
   reference star nearby show no signs of being binaries – making future
   measurements much less complex.
