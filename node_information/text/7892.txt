   Censorship vs. free speech is a false duality.
   JUST A NUDGE

These simple design tricks can help diminish hate speech online

   By Karen HaoOctober 11, 2017

   Everyone is mad at tech platforms. Conservatives attack them for
   heavy-handed censorship. Liberals say they’re too lax on hate speech.
   Both sides agree they have too much unchecked power.

   The age-old problem of balancing free expression with harmful, and
   false, content seems like an impossible problem. But online, at least,
   there’s a lot that sites can do to fix it, says Susan Benesch, a
   faculty associate of Harvard University’s Berkman Klein Center for
   Internet and Society who studies dangerous speech on and
   offline. Indeed, our decades of experience in web design have already
   taught many sites how to discourage incivility and promote reasoned
   debate.

   “There is often the assumption in public discourse and in government
   policymaking and so forth that there are only two things you can do to
   respond to harmful speech online,” says Benesch. “One of those is to
   censor the speech, and the other is to punish the person who has said
   or distributed it.” Instead, she says, we could be persuading people
   not to post the content in the first place, rank it lower in a feed, or
   even convince people to take it down and apologize for it themselves.

   What does this look like in practice?

Change how you incentivize comments

   In 1997, Mike Masnick founded an online technology blog called Techdirt
   to analyze the policy, technology, and legal changes affecting company
   innovation and growth. Early on he decided that his blog would neither
   censor comments and nor filter out anonymous commenters.

   Then a troll used the comments section to describe in graphic detail
   how he was going to kill someone.
   Screenshot/Techdirt
   Techdirt uses “insightful” (the lightbulb icon) and “funny” (the “LOL”
   icon) upvote buttons to incentivize those comments. When a comment
   garners a certain number of votes for either, a badge appears to honor
   the contribution.

   Masnick doesn’t recall exactly how he dealt with the troll, but rather
   than compromise his original vision, he added three small design tweaks
   on each comment to foster more civil discourse: a “funny” upvote button
   (a green “LOL” icon), an “insightful” upvote button (a green
   lightbulb), and a “report” button (a red flag)—to mark abuse, trolling,
   or spam. (The grey buttons were added later for users to pay to promote
   their comments.)

   The idea was, “Can we sort of nudge people in a better direction
   without being heavy-handed about it?” Masnick says. “Certainly at that
   point, there were a bunch of sites that had started having either an
   upvote option or an upvote and downvote option. We just felt that it
   wasn’t a very information-rich solution.”

   In contrast, the funny and insightful buttons incentivized those
   specific types of comments. “It sort of gave an explicit indication
   that that’s what we’re looking for,” he says. “It also gave a way for
   the community to participate.”
   Screenshot/Techdirt
   Techdirt minimizes, but doesn’t delete, comments flagged by the
   community. Anyone can still click through to read the full response.

   When a comment passes a set number of votes for funny or insightful, a
   little icon pops up to honor the author’s contribution. When it reaches
   the threshold for reports, a line of text appears in its place: “This
   comment has been flagged by the community. Click here to show it.”

   “The comments don’t disappear,” Masnick says. “Anyone can click and
   still see them. But it’s an indication that this is not the community’s
   viewpoint.”

   The system isn’t perfect and it may not work for large sites—the blog
   averages 1.5 million visitors per month. But since its implementation,
   “we definitely felt like we saw an uptick in comments that were both
   insightful and funny,” Masnick says.

Encourage long comments, not Twitter-like bursts

   Online publishing platform Medium, which hit 60 million readers a month
   in November 2016, wanted to encourage substantive engagement on the
   site. In 2015, it rolled out its “Responses” feature to allow readers
   to write as much as they wanted in response to something posted, says
   lead designer Peter Cho. Previously, the platform only allowed comments
   to be written about specific paragraphs or lines within the post.
   Screenshot/Medium
   After testing out “Write a response” and “Write a related story,”
   Medium settled with the former.

   Inspired by the idea of long form letter correspondence, the feature
   treated comments as independent stories rather than posts dependent on
   already published material. The design team confirmed from observing
   user behavior that this approach encouraged longer and, subsequently,
   more thoughtful prose.

   They also tested out the different prompts “Write a response” and
   “Write a related story.” The latter generated lengthier posts and more
   engagement from readers, but the team felt the phrase didn’t spur
   direct discussion of ideas. In contrast, “write a response,” sparked
   thoughtful dialogue because commenters replied to the original story—so
   Medium went with that.

   In another test, the design team tried unfurling a comment box at the
   bottom of a story or redirecting users to a full screen.  The full
   screen encouraged greater depth, but unfurling a comment box made it
   easier to reference the original story. The team ultimately created a
   hybrid feature: When a user clicks the comments section to respond, the
   edit box by default stays confined within the bottom of the story, but
   there is also an option to “Go full screen.”

   Medium also decided to let only registered users respond to stories.
   Additionally, an algorithm orders the responses to a story based on
   their relevance to an individual reader. Responses written by the
   story’s author or by the users that a reader follows are highlighted at
   the top of the comments section; responses written by less relevant
   users are hidden behind a “Show all responses” button.

Make users sign pledge to be civil

   Parlio, a platform founded by Egyptian Revolution activist and former
   Google manager Wael Ghonim, used several relatively simple mechanisms
   to dissuade bad behavior.

   First, it required users to sign a civility pledge before joining the
   platform. Unlike most tech platforms that have long-winded, dense
   community guidelines that almost no one reads, Parlio made the pledge
   clear, concise, and prominent. Users had to sign off on each rule,
   helping ensure they read them, Benesch says.
   Screenshot/Parlio

   In addition, the platform implemented a hierarchy of participants.
   Users could post through invitation only, though anyone could read the
   discussion threads. It also hosted Q&A’s to bring the audience more
   civil and stimulating debates, which helped reinforce community norms.

   “Parlio built a small but devoted following, including thought leaders
   from media, academia and business,” chief strategy officer Emily Parker
   wrote in a Politico article published in January. “We hosted remarkably
   civil conversations about divisive issues like race, terrorism,
   refugees, sexism, and even Donald Trump’s candidacy for president.”

   “I find that I’m using Parlio more because I can find a more reasoned
   engagement there than I do on Twitter,” wrote Max Boot, a senior fellow
   at the Council on Foreign Relations, on Commentary magazine in February
   2016.

   Parlio was acquired by Quora in March of the same year because its
   invite-only approach did not allow the platform to scale. It no longer
   accepts postings, and Quora said it bought the site for its talent.
   “Parlio was an acqui-hire for Quora,” the company said. Ghonim also
   wrote of the acquisition: “We look forward to apply what we’ve learnt
   at Parlio, and help build product experiences that make the Internet a
   better place!”

   Benesch says other platforms could take cues from Parlio’s design,
   especially implementing a simple code of conduct that users are more
   likely to read.

Use clear feedback to reform bad behavior

   In 2012, Riot Games, maker of one of the most popular computer games,
   League of Legends, hired Jeffrey Lin to head their social systems
   design team. At the time, the gaming industry believed that vitriolic
   language was an inseparable part of social computer games. Lin
   disagreed. Applying his background in cognitive neuroscience, he
   conducted a series of data-driven design experiments to reduce toxic
   behavior during gameplay.

   In one experiment, Lin measured the impact of giving players who
   engaged in toxic behavior specific feedback. Previously, if a player
   received a suspension for making racist, homophobic, sexist, or
   harassing comments, they were given an error message during login with
   no specifics on why the punishment had occurred. Consequently, players
   often got angry and engaged in worse behavior once they returned to the
   game.
   League of Legends
   League of Legends uses reform cards to give users specific feedback
   about and evidence of their toxic behavior.

   As a response, Lin implemented “reformation cards” to tell players
   exactly what they had said or done to earn their suspension and
   included evidence of the player engaging in that behavior. This time,
   if a player got angry and posted complaints about their reformation
   card on the community forum, other members of the community would
   reinforce the card with comments like, “You deserve every ban you got
   with language like that.” The team saw a 70% increase in their success
   with avoiding repeat offenses from suspended users.
   Screenshot/League of Legends
   Users can honor or report other players based on their behavior.

   Lin also realized that the cards gave players delayed feedback. So he
   conducted another experiment to speed up the feedback cycle by giving
   players mechanisms to report or honor each other during a game. The
   reported phrases—those that other players objected to—were fed into a
   machine learning model, which learned over time which phrases were
   considered toxic in different languages and cultures. If a player used
   any of those flagged terms during a game, the system could give him or
   her feedback immediately after the game ended to discourage their use.
   After the system was implemented, League of Legends saw a 40% drop in
   the number of ranked mode games—the most competitive mode where wins
   and losses determine the team’s global ranking—that had instances of
   racism, homophobia, sexism, or extreme harassment.

   The machine learning algorithm isn’t perfect, Lin said in his 2015 Game
   Developer Conference talk. Once, it flagged a player who was using
   self-deprecating language in the third person. Riot later apologized to
   the player and used the case to improve its system.

   “When you’re dealing with design issues in online communities and
   games, you’re dealing with a pretty new space. Mistakes are going to
   happen,” Lin said. “But when you have the players’ trust, you can
   survive these and come out stronger.”

Hold steadfast to freedom of expression

   Both Masnick and Benesch say that with social media proliferating,
   thoughtful tactics to reduce toxic screaming matches is important. At
   the same time, they worry about society’s growing complacency with
   compromising free speech.

   “As people are shocked and repulsed and even frightened by some of the
   content that they see online, there seems to be an increasing
   willingness to see lots and lots of speech suppressed,” Benesch says.

   The suppressed can ultimately create their own platforms in darker
   corners of the internet where discussions like organizing hate crimes
   or terrorist attacks are no less dangerous.

   “We’re in a time where we are seeing more bad behavior and we’re seeing
   bad behavior go more mainstream than it has in the past,” says Masnick.
   “But I think that at the same time we do have more tools and more
   things that we can do.”

   A screenshot from the Sony’s video of the AI-composed pop song.
   NICE ONE

The first pop song ever written by artificial intelligence is pretty good,
actually

   By Olivia GoldhillSeptember 24, 2016

   We already know that artificial intelligence systems can work in law
   firms and beat the world champion at a game of Go. Now it turns out
   that AI can write some pretty good pop songs, too.

   Researchers at Sony have been working on AI-generated music for years,
   and has previously used AI to create impressive jazz tracks. But this
   is the first time the Sony CSL Research Laboratory has released pop
   music composed by AI, and the results are impressive.

   The first song, “Daddy’s Car,” is a catchy, sunny tune reminiscent of
   The Beatles.

   randing=1&playsinline=true

   The second song, a dreamy ditty called “Mr Shadow,” was created in the
   style of American musicians Irving Berlin, Duke Ellington, George
   Gershwin and Cole Porter.

   randing=1&playsinline=true

   The AI system, called FlowMachines, works by first analyzing a database
   of songs, and then following a particular musical style to create
   similar compositions. The final result does have a human touch,
   however. In the case of both songs above, French composer Benoît Carré
   arranged the songs and wrote the lyrics.

   So perhaps humans are artistically necessary—at least for the time
   being. But Sony is preparing to release a complete album composed by
   artificial intelligence in 2017, and its plan is to create truly great
   AI music. Beyoncé and Taylor Swift: watch your backs.

   A TAXING DEBATE

India is leading a global charge to make corporate giants pay fair tax

   By Max de HaldevangJune 7, 2019

   They’re talking about a revolution in the tax world.

   At a Tokyo summit this weekend, G20 finance ministers are expected to
   give a thumbs-up to a “road map” proposing various ways to upend the
   system that lets many of the world’s corporate giants get away with
   paying little-to-no tax.

   “They’re extraordinarily radical,” Reuven Avi-Yonah, a tax law
   professor at the University of Michigan, said of the proposals. “Even
   the most conservative ones would have seemed almost inconceivable, I
   would say, as short as five years ago.”

   Five years ago, the world’s powers were also discussing reforms to the
   global tax system. After two years of debate between 2013 and 2015 at
   the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in
   Paris, they passed some useful changes—for example, a system to force
   multinationals to tell authorities how much they earn in each country
   and one to tackle tax evasion by the super rich. But reformists were
   left frustrated that the OECD, often dubbed a “club of rich countries,”
   failed to tackle loopholes that allow behemoths like Apple and
   Microsoft to avoid shelling out billions by booking their profits in
   tax havens. “They refused to countenance such radical change,”
   Avi-Yonah said of previous discussions.

   Today, however, none of the proposals submitted to the G20 aim to keep
   the profit-shifting status quo. One of the main reasons that has
   changed is India.

India is “fed up”

   The world’s largest democracy is leading dozens of developing nations,
   which feel digital giants and others should pay taxes in countries
   where they have hundreds of millions of users. After years of the OECD
   asking it to play along with international negotiations, New Delhi has
   made a number of unilateral moves that indicate it is “fed up with the
   OECD and that it cannot wait any longer,” said Ajitesh Kir, a doctoral
   candidate at Michigan and co-author with Avi-Yonah of an upcoming paper
   on India’s tax proposals.

   Its most bombastic move came this April. India offered up an 84-page
   “public consultation” paper, which explored ways to forgo the tortuous
   international process and simply forcing multinationals to pay some
   taxes there. It proposes taxing companies partly on where they have
   economic activity, rather than just where they locate their
   headquarters or intellectual property. Kir thinks prime minister
   Narendra Modi’s newly re-elected government may well pass these changes
   in a matter of months.

   The paper amounts to a loaded weapon that New Delhi can place gently in
   front of them at future negotiations, implicitly demanding: “Send more
   tax revenue to developing countries, or we’ll simply pass this law on
   our own.” Many analysts expect that would inspire other developing
   countries—which rely much more heavily on corporate taxation than
   Western ones—to adopt similar plans, rupturing the international tax
   system from a current state where most countries are aligned on how
   they tax multinationals.

   It would be an unhappy outcome for corporate giants, who enjoy the
   profit-shifting status quo, but would prefer that any changes result in
   a one-size-fits-all system. Having every country put in place a
   different unilateral measure would “be distortive of trade. It would
   increase tax disputes. It would negatively affect multinationals,” said
   Tommaso Faccio, head of secretariat at ICRICT, a commission pushing for
   tax reform, who supports India’s efforts.

   OECD tax chief Pascal Saint-Amans told Quartz that “the threat of
   unilateral measures is all around,” but insisted it is just one factor
   in the negotiations. He warned developing countries about playing with
   fire: “If you’re a very big country like the United States, you can
   protect yourself. But if you’re a midsized or developing country, you
   get screwed by unilateral measures—you lose business or don’t protect
   yourself because companies have ways of using other routes [to avoid
   taxes],” he said.

OECD under fire

   India isn’t alone in using unilateralism to push the OECD. Saint-Amans
   notes that the United States, United Kingdom, and France are among
   other countries adopting their own measures. However, the South Asian
   giant has gone beyond mere policy—making unsubtle stabs at the
   legitimacy of the OECD in language that, in the diplomatic world, is
   akin to a bar brawler smashing a glass bottle and waving the jagged
   remnants in an adversary’s face.

   The attacks have centered on the OECD’s small, overwhelmingly Western,
   membership. In its consultation paper, India argued that these members’
   interests “take precedence over the interests of non member countries.”
   The OECD has opened tax reform discussions to around 90 outside
   countries in what it calls an “inclusive framework.” But, at a recent
   UN tax debate, India’s representative pointedly said, “calling a
   process inclusive does not make it so.” The diplomat then called for a
   new platform to debate tax at the United Nations.

   The apparent threat is that if the OECD doesn’t shift revenues towards
   developing countries, India and others will concertedly push to remove
   its status as the convener of all things tax.

   Saint-Amans said he was unfazed by the criticism, insisting that
   everyone in the “inclusive framework” participates on “an equal
   footing.” He brushed off India’s rhetoric at the United Nations, saying
   activity there is “more about making political statements and taking
   positions, while our work is more about negotiating stuff and agreeing
   on stuff.”

   He pointedly added that for the Modi government, which has prioritized
   attracting foreign business, keeping up its “pretty aggressive”
   behavior might “not be the best way of attracting investment.”

On the table

   The OECD seems to have taken note of India’s machinations, including
   New Delhi’s proposal as one of a handful of options to be considered in
   its “road map” to passing a major tax reform by the end of 2020.

   Tax reformists, like Faccio, see the mere inclusion of a policy once
   deemed unthinkable as a win; a sign the tides are moving in their
   direction. But the proposal being put on the table doesn’t guarantee
   any success. “India are putting pressure on the negotiations—this is
   the first time there is a developing country proposal on table. It’s
   backed by a number of countries but I expect this to be a negotiation,”
   said Faccio, whose commission counts leftist economists Thomas
   Picketty, Joseph Stiglitz, and Gabriel Zucman as members.

   The US Treasury’s international tax policy chief fired a salvo this
   week by calling for developing countries to accept a system which, he
   admitted, won’t make any actual change to revenues “in many, many
   cases.” But Saint-Amans played down the notion that the US and Indian
   positions are too far apart to reconcile, arguing that Washington has
   come a long way to a point where it’s adopting a policy that “would
   have been a shock” just two years ago. “Frankly speaking, this is big,
   this is massive—which makes me think there may be room for some form of
   agreement,” he said. “I’m not sure we’ll be able to bridge the gap, but
   at least we have the building blocks to do so.”

   Reaching an agreement on most areas being discussed would require all
   but a handful of the 129 countries involved to sign on. Finding that
   consensus will be a massive task. Saint-Amans acknowledged that
   “there’s no outcome which benefits everyone,” half-joking that his life
   “is a nightmare” as he tries to help so many disparate countries find
   consensus. But he argued that the question for any pact should be
   whether a concrete, real-world deal is “acceptable” for everyone,
   rather than a notional agreement that’s “optimal” for all.

   “Because if we don’t have a deal countries would go ahead with
   unilateral measures,” he said. “Is the real world satisfactory? No, but
   I don’t know any other world.”

   This story has been updated with quotes from Pascal Saint-Amans.

   Correction (June 6, 2019): Due to an editing error, an earlier version
   of this article mistakenly called the OECD the “Office of Economic
   Cooperation and Development.”

   global tax system. After two years of debate between 2013 and 2015 at
   the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in
   Paris, they passed some useful changes—for example, a system to force
   multinationals to tell authorities how much they earn in each country
   and one to tackle tax evasion by the super rich. But reformists were
   left frustrated that the OECD, often dubbed a “club of rich countries,”
   failed to tackle loopholes that allow behemoths like Apple and
   Microsoft to avoid shelling out billions by booking their profits in
   tax havens. “They refused to countenance such radical change,”
   Avi-Yonah said of previous discussions.

   Today, however, none of the proposals submitted to the G20 aim to keep
   the profit-shifting status quo. One of the main reasons that has
   changed is India.

India is “fed up”

   The world’s largest democracy is leading dozens of developing nations,
   which feel digital giants and others should pay taxes in countries
   where they have hundreds of millions of users. After years of the OECD
   asking it to play along with international negotiations, New Delhi has
   made a number of unilateral moves that indicate it is “fed up with the
   OECD and that it cannot wait any longer,” said Ajitesh Kir, a doctoral
   candidate at Michigan and co-author with Avi-Yonah of an upcoming paper
   on India’s tax proposals.

   Its most bombastic move came this April. India offered up an 84-page
   “public consultation” paper, which explored ways to forgo the tortuous
   international process and simply forcing multinationals to pay some
   taxes there. It proposes taxing companies partly on where they have
   economic activity, rather than just where they locate their
   headquarters or intellectual property. Kir thinks prime minister
   Narendra Modi’s newly re-elected government may well pass these changes
   in a matter of months.

   The paper amounts to a loaded weapon that New Delhi can place gently in
   front of them at future negotiations, implicitly demanding: “Send more
   tax revenue to developing countries, or we’ll simply pass this law on
   our own.” Many analysts expect that would inspire other developing
   countries—which rely much more heavily on corporate taxation than
   Western ones—to adopt similar plans, rupturing the international tax
   system from a current state where most countries are aligned on how
   they tax multinationals.

   It would be an unhappy outcome for corporate giants, who enjoy the
   profit-shifting status quo, but would prefer that any changes result in
   a one-size-fits-all system. Having every country put in place a
   different unilateral measure would “be distortive of trade. It would
   increase tax disputes. It would negatively affect multinationals,” said
   Tommaso Faccio, head of secretariat at ICRICT, a commission pushing for
   tax reform, who supports India’s efforts.

   OECD tax chief Pascal Saint-Amans told Quartz that “the threat of
   unilateral measures is all around,” but insisted it is just one factor
   in the negotiations. He warned developing countries about playing with
   fire: “If you’re a very big country like the United States, you can
   protect yourself. But if you’re a midsized or developing country, you
   get screwed by unilateral measures—you lose business or don’t protect
   yourself because companies have ways of using other routes [to avoid
   taxes],” he said.

OECD under fire

   India isn’t alone in using unilateralism to push the OECD. Saint-Amans
   notes that the United States, United Kingdom, and France are among
   other countries adopting their own measures. However, the South Asian
   giant has gone beyond mere policy—making unsubtle stabs at the
   legitimacy of the OECD in language that, in the diplomatic world, is
   akin to a bar brawler smashing a glass bottle and waving the jagged
   remnants in an adversary’s face.

   The attacks have centered on the OECD’s small, overwhelmingly Western,
   membership. In its consultation paper, India argued that these members’
   interests “take precedence over the interests of non member countries.”
   The OECD has opened tax reform discussions to around 90 outside
   countries in what it calls an “inclusive framework.” But, at a recent
   UN tax debate, India’s representative pointedly said, “calling a
   process inclusive does not make it so.” The diplomat then called for a
   new platform to debate tax at the United Nations.

   The apparent threat is that if the OECD doesn’t shift revenues towards
   developing countries, India and others will concertedly push to remove
   its status as the convener of all things tax.

   Saint-Amans said he was unfazed by the criticism, insisting that
   everyone in the “inclusive framework” participates on “an equal
   footing.” He brushed off India’s rhetoric at the United Nations, saying
   activity there is “more about making political statements and taking
   positions, while our work is more about negotiating stuff and agreeing
   on stuff.”

   He pointedly added that for the Modi government, which has prioritized
   attracting foreign business, keeping up its “pretty aggressive”
   behavior might “not be the best way of attracting investment.”

On the table

   The OECD seems to have taken note of India’s machinations, including
   New Delhi’s proposal as one of a handful of options to be considered in
   its “road map” to passing a major tax reform by the end of 2020.

   Tax reformists, like Faccio, see the mere inclusion of a policy once
   deemed unthinkable as a win; a sign the tides are moving in their
   direction. But the proposal being put on the table doesn’t guarantee
   any success. “India are putting pressure on the negotiations—this is
   the first time there is a developing country proposal on table. It’s
   backed by a number of countries but I expect this to be a negotiation,”
   said Faccio, whose commission counts leftist economists Thomas
   Picketty, Joseph Stiglitz, and Gabriel Zucman as members.

   The US Treasury’s international tax policy chief fired a salvo this
   week by calling for developing countries to accept a system which, he
   admitted, won’t make any actual change to revenues “in many, many
   cases.” But Saint-Amans played down the notion that the US and Indian
   positions are too far apart to reconcile, arguing that Washington has
   come a long way to a point where it’s adopting a policy that “would
   have been a shock” just two years ago. “Frankly speaking, this is big,
   this is massive—which makes me think there may be room for some form of
   agreement,” he said. “I’m not sure we’ll be able to bridge the gap, but
   at least we have the building blocks to do so.”

   Reaching an agreement on most areas being discussed would require all
   but a handful of the 129 countries involved to sign on. Finding that
   consensus will be a massive task. Saint-Amans acknowledged that
   “there’s no outcome which benefits everyone,” half-joking that his life
   “is a nightmare” as he tries to help so many disparate countries find
   consensus. But he argued that the question for any pact should be
   whether a concrete, real-world deal is “acceptable” for everyone,
   rather than a notional agreement that’s “optimal” for all.

   “Because if we don’t have a deal countries would go ahead with
   unilateral measures,” he said. “Is the real world satisfactory? No, but
   I don’t know any other world.”

   A TAXING DEBATE

India is leading a global charge to make corporate giants pay fair tax

   By Max de HaldevangJune 7, 2019

   They’re talking about a revolution in the tax world.

   At a Tokyo summit this weekend, G20 finance ministers are expected to
   give a thumbs-up to a “road map” proposing various ways to upend the
   system that lets many of the world’s corporate giants get away with
   paying little-to-no tax.

   “They’re extraordinarily radical,” Reuven Avi-Yonah, a tax law
   professor at the University of Michigan, said of the proposals. “Even
   the most conservative ones would have seemed almost inconceivable, I
   would say, as short as five years ago.”

   Five years ago, the world’s powers were also discussing reforms to the
   global tax system. After two years of debate between 2013 and 2015 at
   the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in
   Paris, they passed some useful changes—for example, a system to force
   multinationals to tell authorities how much they earn in each country
   and one to tackle tax evasion by the super rich. But reformists were
