   We categorise calls by type (debt collection, serious number,
   sweepstakes, etc.) and give the number in question a tellows score,
   which indicates whether a number is trustworthy or suspicious, helping
   you to decide whether or not to take the call.

   We've all had to deal with the same thing. Your phone rattles furiously
   as it's bombarded with nuisance call after nuisance call and you have
   no way of knowing who's calling. Will it be over enthused telemarketers
   or, perhaps even more annoying, a swift click and the dialing-tone
   drone? Should you take the call or ignore it? Who's on the other end?
   Rest assured that you're not alone. In a world where cold callers can
   sometimes seem to hold a global monopoly over phone lines, tellows aims
   to provide a solution. We function as a vast online database of phone

   not to take the call. This risk rating is generated by a complex
   algorithm that incorporates data such as user ratings and search
   statistics. Want to find out more about how the tellows score works?

   database is constantly expanding and becoming more detailed thanks to
   information from you, our online community. By providing information on
   a number, you can help innumerable other people to anticipate and avoid
   a malicious call.
