General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology

Title:Planck stars

   Authors:Carlo Rovelli, Francesca Vidotto
   (Submitted on 25 Jan 2014 (v1), last revised 8 Feb 2014 (this version,
   v4))

     Abstract: A star that collapses gravitationally can reach a further
     stage of its life, where quantum-gravitational pressure counteracts
     weight. The duration of this stage is very short in the star proper
     time, yielding a bounce, but extremely long seen from the outside,
     because of the huge gravitational time dilation. Since the onset of
     quantum-gravitational effects is governed by energy density ---not
     by size--- the star can be much larger than planckian in this phase.
     The object emerging at the end of the Hawking evaporation of a black
     hole can then be larger than planckian by a factor
     $(m/m_{\scriptscriptstyle P})^n$, where $m$ is the mass fallen into
     the hole, $m_{\scriptscriptstyle P}$ is the Planck mass, and $n$ is
     positive. We consider arguments for $n=1/3$ and for $n=1$. There is
     no causality violation or faster-than-light propagation. The
     existence of these objects alleviates the black-hole information
     paradox. More interestingly, these objects could have astrophysical
     and cosmological interest: they produce a detectable signal, of
     quantum gravitational origin, around the $10^{-14} cm$ wavelength.

Title:Nontrivial Turmites are Turing-universal

   Authors:Diego Maldonado, Anahí Gajardo, Benjamin Hellouin de Menibus,
   Andrés Moreira
   (Submitted on 18 Feb 2017)

     Abstract: A Turmit is a Turing machine that works over a
     two-dimensional grid, that is, an agent that moves, reads and writes
     symbols over the cells of the grid. Its state is an arrow and,
     depending on the symbol that it reads, it turns to the left or to
     the right, switching the symbol at the same time. Several symbols
     are admitted, and the rule is specified by the turning sense that
     the machine has over each symbol. Turmites are a generalization of
     Langtons ant, and they present very complex and diverse behaviors.
     We prove that any Turmite, except for those whose rule does not
     depend on the symbol, can simulate any Turing Machine. We also prove
     the P-completeness of prediction their future behavior by explicitly
     giving a log-space reduction from the Topological Circuit Value
     Problem. A similar result was already established for Langtons ant;
     here we use a similar technique but prove a stronger notion of
     simulation, and for a more general family.

Title:Further travels with my ant

   Authors:David Gale, James Propp, Scott Sutherland, Serge Troubetzkoy
   (Submitted on 19 Jan 1995)

     Abstract: We discuss some properties of a class of cellular automata
     sometimes called a "generalized ant". This system is perhaps most
     easily understood by thinking of an ant which moves about a lattice
     in the plane. At each vertex (or "cell"), the ant turns right or
     left, depending on the the state of the cell, and then changes the
     state of the cell according to certain prescribed rule strings.
     (This system has been the subject of several Mathematical
     Entertainments columns in the Mathematical Intelligencer; this
     article will be a future such column). At various times, the
     distributions of the states of the cells for certain ants is
     bilaterally symmetric; we categorize a class of ants for which this
     is the case and give a proof using Truchet tiles.

Title:Two-Dimensional Kolmogorov Complexity and Validation of the Coding
Theorem Method by Compressibility

   Authors:Hector Zenil, Fernando Soler-Toscano, Jean-Paul Delahaye,
   Nicolas Gauvrit
   (Submitted on 30 Dec 2012 (v1), last revised 26 Aug 2015 (this version,
   v4))

     Abstract: We propose a measure based upon the fundamental
     theoretical concept in algorithmic information theory that provides
     a natural approach to the problem of evaluating $n$-dimensional
     complexity by using an $n$-dimensional deterministic Turing machine.
     The technique is interesting because it provides a natural
     algorithmic process for symmetry breaking generating complex
     $n$-dimensional structures from perfectly symmetric and fully
     deterministic computational rules producing a distribution of
     patterns as described by algorithmic probability. Algorithmic
     probability also elegantly connects the frequency of occurrence of a
     pattern with its algorithmic complexity, hence effectively providing
     estimations to the complexity of the generated patterns. Experiments
     to validate estimations of algorithmic complexity based on these
     concepts are presented, showing that the measure is stable in the
     face of some changes in computational formalism and that results are
     in agreement with the results obtained using lossless compression
     algorithms when both methods overlap in their range of
     applicability. We then use the output frequency of the set of
     2-dimensional Turing machines to classify the algorithmic complexity
     of the space-time evolutions of Elementary Cellular Automata.

Title:Algorithmic Complexity for Short Binary Strings Applied to Psychology:
A Primer

   Authors:Nicolas Gauvrit, Hector Zenil, Jean-Paul Delahaye, Fernando
   Soler-Toscano
   (Submitted on 15 Jun 2011 (v1), last revised 9 Dec 2013 (this version,
   v3))

     Abstract: Since human randomness production has been studied and
     widely used to assess executive functions (especially inhibition),
     many measures have been suggested to assess the degree to which a
     sequence is random-like. However, each of them focuses on one
     feature of randomness, leading authors to have to use multiple
     measures. Here we describe and advocate for the use of the accepted
     universal measure for randomness based on algorithmic complexity, by
     means of a novel previously presented technique using the the
     definition of algorithmic probability. A re-analysis of the
     classical Radio Zenith data in the light of the proposed measure and
     methodology is provided as a study case of an application.
