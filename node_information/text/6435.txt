   With a double degree in biotechnology and business management, Romain
   is equally known for his sailing skills and participations in the
   America’s Cup in 2000 and 2003. From 2003 to 2006, he worked for
   Cerpolex specialized in polar logistics in the Arctic, Antarctic and in
   Siberia. They were involved in the organisation of sporting, tourist
   and scientific expeditions at the poles, but also in the discovery of
   frozen mammoths in Siberia. He has been coordinating the expeditions
   since 2004 and is now the Executive Director of the Tara Expeditions
   Foundation.
