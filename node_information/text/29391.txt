Overview


   Flashtalking and its subsidiaries and affiliated companies
   (“Flashtalking,” “we” or “us”) provides an interactive advertising
   technology that delivers advertisements on behalf of advertisers and
   allows them to serve ads that are personalized to users’ interests and
   to understand how users respond to their ads (the “Services”). Our
   Services allow brands to serve ads that are more likely to be of
   interest and value to users of the internet and mobile apps.

   As the industry’s leading independent provider of creative delivery,
   media measurement and advertising effectiveness, we do not collect or
   process directly-identifiable information, such as a person’s name and
   email address, or hold sensitive data of any sort. Nor do we buy or
   sell media, or broker consumer profiles or audiences.

   Our products and policies limit our collection and use of personal data
   to online identifiers such as IP addresses, cookie IDs and device IDs,
   which we use for fraud detection, engagement analysis, and advertising
   delivery and evaluation activities that are at the core of our
   business. Flashtalking may also use a cookie-less approach called
   fTrack to identify devices. While this technology looks at a number of
   signals, it does not collect any private or sensitive data from a
   user’s device and fully respects users’ opt-out and privacy
   instructions – even if a user deletes their cookies. Learn more about
   Flashtalking’s use of data in our Privacy Policy.
     __________________________________________________________________



Your Choices


   Users can easily opt-out of tailored advertising and all tracking
   (cookie-based and cookie-less) through our website, or industry opt-out
   sites in the US and Europe. Furthermore, Flashtalking is audited
   annually and monitored continually by the NAI for compliance with their
   industry-leading privacy guidelines.
