Significance

   Whether the dry-season length will increase is a central question in
   determining the fate of the rainforests over Amazonia and the future
   global atmospheric CO[2] concentration. We show observationally that
   the dry-season length over southern Amazonia has increased
   significantly since 1979. We do not know what has caused this change,
   although it resembles the effects of anthropogenic climate change. The
   global climate models that were presented in the Intergovernmental
   Panel on Climate Change’s fifth assessment report seem to substantially
   underestimate the variability of the dry-season length. Such a bias
   implies that the future change of the dry-season length, and hence the
   risk of rainforest die-back, may be underestimated by the projections
   of these models.

Abstract

   We have observed that the dry-season length (DSL) has increased over
   southern Amazonia since 1979, primarily owing to a delay of its ending
   dates (dry-season end, DSE), and is accompanied by a prolonged fire
   season. A poleward shift of the subtropical jet over South America and
   an increase of local convective inhibition energy in austral winter
   (June–August) seem to cause the delay of the DSE in austral spring
   (September–November). These changes cannot be simply linked to the
   variability of the tropical Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Although they
   show some resemblance to the effects of anthropogenic forcings reported
   in the literature, we cannot attribute them to this cause because of
   inadequate representation of these processes in the global climate
   models that were presented in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
   Change’s Fifth Assessment Report. These models significantly
   underestimate the variability of the DSE and DSL and their controlling
   processes. Such biases imply that the future change of the DSE and DSL
   may be underestimated by the climate projections provided by the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Fifth Assessment Report
   models. Although it is not clear whether the observed increase of the
   DSL will continue in the future, were it to continue at half the rate
   of that observed, the long DSL and fire season that contributed to the
   2005 drought would become the new norm by the late 21st century. The
   large uncertainty shown in this study highlights the need for a focused
   effort to better understand and simulate these changes over southern
   Amazonia.

   Fifteen percent of global photosynthesis occurs in the Amazon
   rainforest (1), where 25% of plant species are found (2). This
   rainforest ecosystem normally removes C from the atmosphere but
   released more than 1 Pg of C to the atmosphere in the 2005 drought (3).
   Consequently, even a partial loss of these forests would substantially
   increase global atmospheric CO[2] (4, 5) and reduce biodiversity. The
   dry-season length (DSL) is among the most important climate limitations
   for sustaining rainforests (6⇓⇓–9), especially in southern Amazonia,
   where rainforests are exposed to relatively long dry seasons and
   vulnerable to increasing conversion of native forests to cultivated
   crops (10⇓–12). The extreme droughts in 2005 and 2010 had strong
   impacts on the rainforest and its C cycle (3, 13, 14). These unusual
   events, along with possible increase of drought severity and DSL during
   the past few decades (e.g., refs. 15 and 16) heighten the urgency of
   understanding what causes these dry anomalies and whether they will
   continue into the future. Contrary to the observed drying, some global
   climate models that previously projected strong drying over Amazonia
   now project much weaker drying by the end of the 21st century as these
   models evolve (17). Do these observed events represent the extremes of
   natural climate variability, or do climate projections underestimate
   potential future changes? This study explores one aspect of these
   questions by focusing on the change of DSL.

Evidence from Observations

   Rain-gauge data from Amazonia are sparse and generally inadequate for
   assessing a trend in rainfall amounts. However, the dry-season end
   (DSE) over southern Amazonia is marked by a relatively rapid increase
   of rainfall on the order of 4–5 mm/d over areas of thousands of square
   kilometers during austral spring, and vice versa for the dry-season
   arrival (DSA) during austral fall (March–May) (18, 19). Hence, the
   timing of the DSA and DSE should be more clearly detectable by the
   rain-gauge network than the change in rainfall amount.

   The DSL and DSE are derived from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration (NOAA) Climate Prediction Center’s improved 1° gridded
   historical daily precipitation analysis over the Brazilian and Bolivian
   Amazon for the period of January 1978 to December 2007 (referred to as
   the Silva data; ref. 20) and the NOAA Climate Diagnostics Center’s 1°
   gridded daily precipitation data over the Brazilian and other northern
   Amazonian countries for the period of January 1940 to December 2011
   (referred to as the recently updated SA24 data; ref. 21). These two
   regional daily rainfall datasets are based on ∼300–450 rain gauges that
   have been present throughout Amazonia (20, 21) for most of the time
   since 1979, more than those included in the global daily rainfall data
   (22). Both datasets show patterns of temporal variability, including
   their trends, similar to that obtained from the Global Precipitation
   Climatology Project (GPCP) monthly rainfall data and the Tropical
   Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite for the periods they
   overlap, although these regional rain gauge-based datasets show lower
   rainfall amounts compared with the satellite-based GPCP and TRMM (Fig.
   S1). The Silva dataset (20) has fewer rain gauges over the northeastern
   part of our southern Amazonian domain (5°–15°S, 50°–70°W), whereas the
   SA24 dataset (21) does not include rain gauges over the Bolivian
   Amazon, in the southwestern part of this domain. To mitigate such
   differences in the areas covered by rain gauges, we average these two
   rainfall datasets over each map cell for the period of 1979–2007 when
   they overlap and use SA24 for the period of 2008–2011 to form a merged
   daily rainfall dataset, referred to as the P[M] data. For the period of
   January 1979–December 2011, daily rain rates of the P[M] data are first
   spatially averaged over the southern Amazonian domain and then
   temporally averaged over a 5-d period (pentad) to reduce synoptic noise
   in estimating the DSA and DSE dates. The observed DSE is determined by
   the first date when the pentad mean rain rate changes from below to
   above the climatological annual mean rain rate of the same rainfall
   dataset during six out of eight pentads, and vice versa for the DSA
   (19). This definition captures the rapid transition from a lower to
   higher rainfall regime associated with the DSE, and vice versa for the
   DSA. The DSE and DSA are not influenced by any bias of rainfall amount,
   as long as the temporal patterns of the rainfall variation are not
   affected. Similar definitions have been widely used in the literature
   (18, 19, 23). For analysis of models, we modify our criterion to five
   out of eight pentads to best match the modeled DSE and DSA with
   observations.

   The trends are computed using a least square fit. The confidence
   intervals and significance are determined based on the effective sample
   size and a t test, following Santer et al. (24). The trend significance
   is further tested by the right-tailed (positive) Vogelsang trend test,
   a more conservative test for strongly auto-correlated and nonstationary
   time series (25).

   Fig. 1 shows the temporal variations of the DSL, DSE, and the mean
   rainfall during the dry-to-wet transition in austral spring season
   derived from the P[M] dataset. The strong delay of the DSE in 2004 and
   2005 is consistent with previous reports on the 2005 Amazonian drought
   (26, 27). The 2010 drought was mainly caused by strong rainfall
   reduction in early and middle 2010, followed by a rapid increase of
   rainfall at the end of October (16) (Fig. S2). Hence, the DSE in 2010
   was not delayed. As shown in Table 1, the DSL has increased at a rate
   of 1.3 ± 0.5 pentad or about 6.5 ± 2.5 d per decade for uncertainties
   of P < 5% (24). This increase is mainly caused by a delay of the DSE at
   a rate of 0.9 ± 0.4 pentads or 4.5 ± 2.0 d per decade (P < 5%), as also
   evident in a decrease of rainfall by 0.19 ± 0.04 mm/d per decade (P <
   5%) during austral spring. The more stringent Vogelsang test (25) still
   shows that these trends are significantly positive, but with
   uncertainty P < 10%. This delay of the DSE in recent decades is
   consistent with that inferred from a monthly rainfall dataset (16), the
   significant trends of decreasing rainfall at two long-term rain gauge
   stations located within our southern Amazonia domain (28), and also a
   decrease of convective cloudiness during austral spring detected by
   satellites (29). No significant changes of the DSA and rain rate are
   detected (Fig. S3).

   (A) Annual time series of the DSL (red line) and DSE (blue line) dates
   derived from the P[M] daily rainfall data over the southern Amazonian
   domain show a decrease of DSL due to a delay of DSE. The unit is pentad
   (5 d). On the left axis, the 55th pentad corresponds to September 2–7
   of the calendar date and the 70th pentad corresponds to December 10–15.
   (B) Time series of austral spring seasonal rainfall over southern
   Amazonia derived from the P[M] and GPCP datasets show decrease of
   rainfall consistent with the delay of DSE shown in (A). The linear
   trend is determined by a least-square fitting. Trends are significant
   at P < 5% based on Santer et al. (24).

   The linear trends, confident interval and significance of the DSL and
   DSE for the periods 1979–2011 and 1979–2005

   The main fire season over southern Amazonia spans the period of
   August–October, during the transition from the dry to the wet season. A
   delayed DSE would prolong the fire season, leading to an increase of
   fire counts during October and November. Thus, the latter measured by
   satellite can provide an independent verification of the former. Fig. 2
   shows that a delay of the DSE is correlated with fire counts in the
   prolonged fire season (the correlation coefficient for the de-trended
   data is R = 0.83, P < 0.01, based on the method of ref. 30). Similarly,
   the correlation coefficient for the de-trended DSL and fire counts is
   0.88, P < 0.01. This relationship is further supported by an increase
   of the McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI, ref. 31), as determined
   from two independent atmospheric reanalysis products, the European
   Center for Medium Range Forecast Reanalysis (ERA)-Interim (32) and the
   National Center for Environment Prediction (NCEP) reanalyses (33). A
   high FFDI value represents a favorable meteorological condition for
   fire. These consistent changes between three physically related but
   independently obtained variables lend additional support to the
   observed delay of the DSE.

   The DSE (unit is pentad) versus FFDI (green squares, units are
   nondimensional) and fire count (red circles, unit is number of pixels)
   in October and November for the period of 2000–2011 suggest prolonged
   fire season with delayed DSE. The 50th pentad corresponds to September
   10–15 and the 70th pentad corresponds to December 10–15. The fire
   counts are derived from the moderate resolution imaging
   spectroradiometer fire-count data. FFDI is first derived from the
   ERA-Interim and NCEP reanalysis, respectively, and then averaged to
   obtain its values shown in the figure.

   What could cause this delay of the DSE over southern Amazonia? Previous
   studies have established that stronger convective inhibition energy
   (CIN) and/or a poleward displacement of the subtropical jet over South
   America (SJ[SA]) in austral winter are important contributors to an
   anomalously late DSE in austral spring (19, 34, 35). The former
   increases the work required to lift air near the surface to the level
   of free convection, above which the rising air becomes buoyant. The
   latter blocks cold-front incursions from the extratropics that would
   trigger rainfall over a large area and result in DSE (35). The
   influence of these preconditions on the DSE can be altered by random
   variations of the atmospheric circulation and oceanic circulations in
   austral spring. Such influences should be reduced by averaging over
   time, leading to more clear relationships between the SJ[SA], CIN, and
   DSE on a decadal scale than on an interannual scale. Fig. 3 shows that
   the delay of the DSE tends to occur when the SJ[SA] is displaced
   poleward and CIN is relatively large. Likewise, an earlier DSE tends to
   occur when the SJ[SA] is displaced equatorward and CIN is relatively
   low. Strong CIN combined with equatorward displacement of SJ[SA] or low
   CIN with poleward SJ[SA] do not seem to cause delay of the DSE,
   presumably because they compensate each other’s effects on the DSE. On
   a decadal scale, CIN increased in the 1990s relative to the 1980s (P <
   5%, ref. 36). In the 2000s, CIN increased further from its values in
   the 1980s and 1990s, and SJ[SA] becomes significantly more poleward. On
   an interannual scale, these connections between the SJ[SA], CIN, and
   DSE variations are less obvious, presumably owing to the influence on
   the DSE of random interannual variations of the tropical sea surface
   temperatures (SSTAs) and the Southern Annular Mode of the atmosphere in
   austral spring.

   Fig. 3.

   DSE date as a function of the latitudinal location of the SJ[SA] and
   CIN in austral winter over southern Amazonia for the period of
   1979–2011 suggests a preference of poleward SJ[SA] and strong CIN by
   the delayed DSE. CIN and SJ[SA] are first calculated using the inputs
   from ERA-Interim (ERAI) and NCEP reanalysis, respectively, then
   averaged to obtain the values shown in this figure. The triangle,
   square, and diamond symbols denote decadal means for the 1980s, 1990s,
   and 2000s. The error bars on these symbols represent the SEs with
   uncertainties of P < 5% (36).

   What has caused the increase of CIN and poleward displacement of the
   SJ[SA]? Most previous studies have linked change of rainfall over
   southern Amazonia to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), changes of
   meridional SST gradient in the tropical Atlantic ocean associated with
   the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO, 26, 27, 37) and that of
   SJ[SA] to the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) (35, 37). Because the
   periods of available rainfall data are too short to obtain significant
   correlations of these variables on a decadal scale, we evaluate the
   relationship between CIN, SJ[SA], and the SSTAs indices using their
   unfiltered de-trended time series for austral winter. Because the
   results are dominated by the interannual variations, the correlation
   coefficients between AMO and CIN may be weakened by strong interference
   from ENSO compared with those that might be obtained on a decadal scale
   from a longer record. The result indicates that CIN is marginally
   correlated with the PDO index (P = 8%, 30), whereas SJ[SA] is not
   correlated with any of the ENSO, PDO, or AMO indices (Table S1). The
   lack of any robust correlation is consistent with the facts that (i)
   the SSTAs associated with ENSO, PDO, and AMO are generally weaker in
   austral winter and so are their influences on atmospheric circulation
   compared with austral summer or fall (38⇓–40) and (ii) CIN is
   influenced by soil moisture anomalies, vegetation root depth, and lower
   troposphere temperature. Hence, any relationship with SSTAs is likely
   to be complex and nonlinear.

   Could the decadal phase change of PDO and AMO qualitatively explain the
   change of CIN and SJ[SA]? The PDO has been decreasing since the 1990s
   and became overall negative during 2000s. Such a change would not
   explain a poleward shift of SJ[SA] (38) and an increase of CIN over
   southern Amazonia. AMO has shown a positive trend since 1979. However,
   the correlation between AMO and CIN is insignificant. Thus, natural
   interannual and decadal oceanic variability cannot be used to explain
   the changes of CIN and SJ[SA] during the last few decades.

   Could greenhouse effect-forced changes explain the increase of CIN and
   poleward shift of SJ[SA]? Previous studies have established that the
   observed decreasing atmospheric temperature lapse rate and increasing
   surface temperature over the tropics during the past several decades
   are consistent with the “fingerprint” of the greenhouse effect (41).
   Over Amazonia, surface relative humidity has been decreasing owing to
   an increase of surface temperature over the past few decades (42).
   These changes could increase CIN, especially during winter (the dry
   season), when the surface air humidity cannot increase proportionally
   with temperature.

   The poleward shift of SJ[SA] can be contributed by both a globally
   poleward shift of the southern hemisphere subtropical jets (SJ[SH]) and
   by the atmospheric planetary wave response to warm SSTAs over the
   central Pacific that is distinctively different from those induced by
   the ENSO and PDO (39, 43). In austral winter, the former is attributed
   to having been forced by the increase of greenhouse gases (43, 44),
   whereas the trend of the latter is attributed to having been forced by
   the warming of the central Pacific and Indian oceans in turn forced by
   greenhouse gases (39). The depletion of Antarctic ozone contributes
   importantly to the poleward shift of SJ[SH] in austral summer and fall,
   but not in the winter season. It peaks in the middle stratosphere
   during austral spring (45) and its influence on atmospheric circulation
   propagates downward to the upper troposphere to influence the SJ[SH]
   during austral summer. However, after the ozone hole recovers in
   austral fall, its effect becomes negligible for the austral winter
   (45). Hence, the observed changes of CIN and SJ[SA] seem to be broadly
   consistent with those expected from forcing by greenhouse warming, and
   not a consequence of the ozone hole.

   Land use can reduce land surface latent fluxes, and biomass burning
   aerosols can stabilize the atmospheric temperature stratification and
   weaken the dry-to-wet-season transition (46⇓⇓–49). Both could
   contribute to the delay of the DSE. However, long-term rain gauges and
   satellite observations show more clear decrease of rainfall and high
   clouds over the southwestern and northeastern parts of southern
   Amazonia where land use and fire are less prevalent than they are over
   the “Fire Arch” in southeastern Amazonia (28, 29). Furthermore, the DSE
   did not change before or after the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption (Fig.
   1). Thus, what influence biomass burning aerosols and land use have on
   the observed delay of the DSE remains unclear beyond the observation
   that they do not seem to be the dominant cause.

Comparison with Climate Models

   Attributing the changes of DSE, CIN, and SJ[SA] to anthropogenic
   climate change and projecting their future changes require creditable
   climate models. Hence, we evaluate the 50 simulations provided by eight
   global climate models presented in the Intergovernmental Panel on
   Climate Change’s Fifth Assessment Report (IPCC AR5) based on the
   availability of their daily outputs of rainfall and other needed
   climate variables. These models are identified along with relevant
   information in Datasets and Methods and Table S2. The changes from the
   historical simulations of the global climate models that were presented
   in the IPCC AR5 are expected to be a result of random natural climate
   variability and appropriate anthropogenic and external forcing. If
   these models were perfect and the numbers of simulations were
   sufficient to generate a full spectrum of climate variability, one or
   more of these simulations would have captured the observed changes.
   Thus, the discrepancies between the models and observations should be
   caused either by undersampling of the possible changes owing to
   insufficient numbers of simulations or model errors, or both. Because
   the IPCC AR5 historical simulations end in 2005, we compare the
   observed changes for the period of 1979–2005 to the modeled 27-y
   changes in Fig. 4.

   Fig. 4.

   Distributions of the nonoverlapped 27-y trends of the DSE generated by
   the natural variability simulations (blue), historical simulations
   (red), and projections of future changes under the RCP8.5 scenario
   (green), respectively, suggest that the modeled DSE changes, including
   the projected future change, are significantly weaker than that which
   are observed during 1979–2005. The top 5% of the modeled trend samples
   are marked by blue, red, and green vertical dashed lines for the
   natural variability, historical simulations, and RCP8.5 scenario,
   respectively. The observed 27-y trend and confidence interval with
   uncertainties of P < 5% are marked by the black circle and horizontal
   bar in the upper right corner and are derived from the P[M] daily
   rainfall data following method of Santer et al. (24).

   The trend distribution of the simulations of natural variability is
   generated by 158 samples that represent nonoverlapped 27-y changes from
   a total of 4,266 y of simulation by multiple climate models. These
   simulations represent climate variability of the DSE changes for up to
   a few thousand years return period, and thus should adequately
   represent the range of the DSE natural variability for the time scale
   relevant to this study. The historical simulations by the eight climate
   models provide 40 samples of nonoverlapped 27-y changes for the period
   from the mid-19th century to 2005 and the climate projections under the
   Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 scenario (RCP8.5) (50) provide
   38 samples of the nonoverlapped 27-y changes for the period from 2006
   up to 2299. Their ranges of the probability distributions are
   comparable to those represented by 158 samples of the natural
   variability simulations, despite their smaller number of samples. Thus,
   the differences between the statistical distribution of modeled changes
   and those observed should be mainly due to the models’ uncertainty,
   instead of due to under sampling of the climate variability.

   Fig. 4 shows that all of the changes of the DSE during 27-y periods
   modeled by the natural climate variability, the historical simulations,
   and the RCP8.5 future scenario are significantly smaller than those
   observed, although the occurrences of delayed DSE trends increase with
   anthropogenic climate change. For example, the historical simulations,
   with realistic anthropogenic forcing, show an increased frequency of
   delayed trends of the DSE compared with those of the natural
   variability scenario, and more so for the RCP8.5 future scenario.
   However, these simulations do not produce any trends that are
   comparable to the large observed trend. The RCP8.5 scenario assumes
   that by 2100 the global anthropogenic radiative forcing would reach 8.5
   Wm^−2 and that the atmospheric CO[2] concentration would become ∼1,360
   ppm. However, the projected DSE changes are still significantly smaller
   than the observed DSE delay during the past 27-y period (with the
   uncertainty of P < 5%, Fig. 4). Because the change of the DSE dominates
   that of the DSL, the simulated and projected DSL changes are also
   significantly smaller than those observed (Fig. S4).

   Why is there such a large discrepancy between modeled and observed
   changes of the DSE? Either the observed change of DSE during 1979–2005
   represents an extremely large swing from natural variability with a
   return period greater than 4,000 y or the climate models underestimate
   the natural and forced climatic variability of the DSE. To explore the
   possibility of the latter, we show in Fig. 5 that no model could
   reproduce the observed relationship between the changes of DSE, SJ[SA],
   and CIN in any of their historical simulations. The majority of the
   simulations show much weaker changes of SJ[SA] and CIN. These biases
   are consistent with the underestimation of SJ[SH] variability reported
   in the literature (44) and the overestimation of the influences of the
   Pacific and Atlantic Intertropical Convergence Zones on Amazonia
   dry-season rainfall (51). The latter would undermine land-surface
   feedback and reduce the sensitivity of the CIN to land-surface warming
   and drying. Thus, the comparisons between historical simulations and
   observations suggest that the climate models evaluated in this study
   probably underestimate the sensitivity of the DSE, SJ[SA], and CIN to
   climate variability and anthropogenic change and that they could in
   turn underestimate potential future changes of the DSE and DSL over
   southern Amazonia (Fig. 4 and Figs. S4 and S5).

   trends of the SJ[SA] (y axis) and CIN (x axis) in austral winter for
   the period of 1979–2005 derived from the historical simulations of the
   eight IPCC AR5 models (circles) is different from that which is
   observed (red square). The character in the center of each circle
   indicates the model’s name shown in Table S2. The ensemble mean of the
   eight models is indicated by the diamond symbol.

Implications

   This study suggests that the IPCC AR5 models may underestimate the
   variability of the DSE (Fig. 4) and DSL (Fig. S4) over southern
   Amazonia and their sensitivity to the natural variability and
   anthropogenic forcing of the climate system. These biases could lead to
   an underestimate of the potential future climatic drying over southern
   Amazonia. However, one cannot simply extrapolate the observed changes
   to the future. Hence, we do not know how the DSL and DSE will change in
   the future without knowing what has caused their past changes. However,
   a risk of a future larger increase of DSL and delay of DSE does seem to
   be nonzero, as implied by its connection to the apparent influence of
   greenhouse-forced climate change on the CIN and SJ[SA]. Although its
   risk is highly uncertain, such a future increase of the DSL would have
   strong impacts on southern Amazonia were it to occur. For example, if
   we assume that the DSL were to increase at half of the rates we
   observed during 1979–2011, the DSL would be about 1 ± 1/3 mo longer by
   2090 than that in the 2000s. Consequently, the long DSL and fire season
   during the 2004–2005 drought would become the new norm (Fig. 2). Given
   the observed slow recovery of the rainforests after the 2005 drought
   (14), these changes could greatly increase the danger of a transition
   from a rainforest to a savanna regime over southern Amazonia (10, 12,
   52), especially with the longer DSL coupled to the higher surface
   temperatures and more fragmented forests expected in the future (11,
   12, 53), and even accounting for the increase of dry season resilience
   of the rainforest in an elevated CO[2] environment (17). Given such
   potential impacts on the global and regional C cycle and biodiversity,
   the large uncertainty in determining future changes of the DSL and DSE
   shown by this study highlights the importance and urgency of better
   monitoring and understanding the changes of the dry season over
   southern Amazonia. In addition to the impact of global climate forcing,
   the roles that regional biomass burning and land use play in the DSL
   over southern Amazonia also need to be clarified.

Datasets and Methods

   The CIN, SJ[SA], and FFDI are all derived from the ERA-Interim and the
   NCEP reanalyses. CIN in Fig. 3 is computed from 6-h temperature,
   humidity, and geopotential height profiles. In Fig. 5, a CIN index (54)
   is used because the models do not provide the instantaneous temperature
   and humidity profiles needed for computing CIN. The latitude of the
   SJ[SA] is determined by the equatorward latitudinal location of the 28
   m⋅s^−1 monthly zonal wind contour at 200 hPa between 30°and 90°W. This
   index most consistently captures the latitudinal variation of the
   SJ[SA]associated with tropical meridional circulation changes in the
   two reanalysis products, although the use of other similar zonal wind
   indices does not change the variations of the SJ[SA]. The variation of
   SJ[SA] based on this index is consistent with those determined by the
   zero stream function in latitudinal-height space and the 250 W⋅m^−2
   Outgoing Longwave Radiation Contour (55) used in the literature to
   describe changes of global subtropical jets. The FFDI (31) is computed
   as Embedded Image Embedded Image Embedded Image Embedded Image where T
   is the daily maximum temperature (°C), H is the daily minimum relative
   humidity (%), W is the daily mean wind speed at 10 m (km/h), N is the
   number of days since the last rain, R is the total rainfall (mm) in the
   most recent 24 h with rain, and I is the total rainfall (mm) needed to
   restore the soil moisture content to 200 mm. These inputs are provided
   by the 6-h outputs from the ERA-Interim and NCEP reanalysis. Fire count
   is obtained from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer on
   board the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) aqua
   satellite (56) (ftp://fire:burnt@fuoco.geog.umd.edu/).

   The AMO index is obtained from
   www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/timeseries/AMO/. The PDO index is obtained
   from http://jisao.washington.edu/pdo/PDO.latest. The Niño3 and Niño4
   indices are obtained from
   www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/climateindices/list/.

   Eight of the climate models that were part of the IPCC AR5 are used in
   this study based on availability of the daily outputs of precipitation
   and other needed climate variables. These models are the National
   Center for Atmospheric Research Community Climate System Model Version
   4 (CCSM4), the NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Climate Model
   Version 3 (GFDL-CM3), the Earth System Model (GFDL-ESM2M), the NASA
   Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS)-E2-H and GISS-E2-R models,
   the United Kingdom Met Office Hadley Center (HadGEM2-CC and HadGEM2-ES)
   models, and the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI-ESM-LR)
   model. All of the model output and observational datasets are remapped
   to the 2.5° latitude and longitude grids when they are compared with
   each other in Figs. 4 and 5. A brief summary of model resolutions,
   available ensemble simulations and sources of the models are provided
   in Table S2.

Significance

   The strong focus on species extinctions, a critical aspect of the
   contemporary pulse of biological extinction, leads to a common
   misimpression that Earth’s biota is not immediately threatened, just
   slowly entering an episode of major biodiversity loss. This view
   overlooks the current trends of population declines and extinctions.
   Using a sample of 27,600 terrestrial vertebrate species, and a more
   detailed analysis of 177 mammal species, we show the extremely high
   degree of population decay in vertebrates, even in common “species of
   low concern.” Dwindling population sizes and range shrinkages amount to
   a massive anthropogenic erosion of biodiversity and of the ecosystem
   services essential to civilization. This “biological annihilation”
   underlines the seriousness for humanity of Earth’s ongoing sixth mass
   extinction event.

Abstract

   The population extinction pulse we describe here shows, from a
   quantitative viewpoint, that Earth’s sixth mass extinction is more
   severe than perceived when looking exclusively at species extinctions.
   Therefore, humanity needs to address anthropogenic population
   extirpation and decimation immediately. That conclusion is based on
   analyses of the numbers and degrees of range contraction (indicative of
   population shrinkage and/or population extinctions according to the
   International Union for Conservation of Nature) using a sample of
   27,600 vertebrate species, and on a more detailed analysis documenting
   the population extinctions between 1900 and 2015 in 177 mammal species.
   We find that the rate of population loss in terrestrial vertebrates is
   extremely high—even in “species of low concern.” In our sample,
   comprising nearly half of known vertebrate species, 32% (8,851/27,600)
   are decreasing; that is, they have decreased in population size and
   range. In the 177 mammals for which we have detailed data, all have
   lost 30% or more of their geographic ranges and more than 40% of the
   species have experienced severe population declines (>80% range
   shrinkage). Our data indicate that beyond global species extinctions
   Earth is experiencing a huge episode of population declines and
   extirpations, which will have negative cascading consequences on
   ecosystem functioning and services vital to sustaining civilization. We
   describe this as a “biological annihilation” to highlight the current
   magnitude of Earth’s ongoing sixth major extinction event.

   The loss of biological diversity is one of the most severe human-caused
   global environmental problems. Hundreds of species and myriad
   populations are being driven to extinction every year (1⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓–8). From
   the perspective of geological time, Earth’s richest biota ever is
   already well into a sixth mass extinction episode (9⇓⇓⇓⇓–14). Mass
   extinction episodes detected in the fossil record have been measured in
   terms of rates of global extinctions of species or higher taxa (e.g.,
   ref. 9). For example, conservatively almost 200 species of vertebrates
   have gone extinct in the last 100 y. These represent the loss of about
   2 species per year. Few realize, however, that if subjected to the
   estimated “background” or “normal” extinction rate prevailing in the
   last 2 million years, the 200 vertebrate species losses would have
   taken not a century, but up to 10,000 y to disappear, depending on the
   animal group analyzed (11). Considering the marine realm, specifically,
   only 15 animal species have been recorded as globally extinct (15),
   likely an underestimate, given the difficulty of accurately recording
   marine extinctions. Regarding global extinction of invertebrates,
   available information is limited and largely focused on threat level.
   For example, it is estimated that 42% of 3,623 terrestrial invertebrate
   species, and 25% of 1,306 species of marine invertebrates assessed on
   the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List are
   classified as threatened with extinction (16). However, from the
   perspective of a human lifetime it is difficult to appreciate the
   current magnitude of species extinctions. A rate of two vertebrate
   species extinctions per year does not generate enough public concern,
   especially because many of those species were obscure and had limited
   ranges, such as the Catarina pupfish (Megupsilon aporus, extinct in
   2014), a tiny fish from Mexico, or the Christmas Island pipistrelle
   (Pipistrellus murrayi, extinct in 2009), a bat that vanished from its
   namesake volcanic remnant.

   Species extinctions are obviously very important in the long run,
   because such losses are irreversible and may have profound effects
   ranging from the depletion of Earth’s inspirational and esthetic
   resources to deterioration of ecosystem function and services (e.g.,
   refs. 17⇓⇓–20). The strong focus among scientists on species
   extinctions, however, conveys a common impression that Earth’s biota is
   not dramatically threatened, or is just slowly entering an episode of
   major biodiversity loss that need not generate deep concern now (e.g.,
   ref. 21, but see also refs. 9, 11, 22). Thus, there might be sufficient
   time to address the decay of biodiversity later, or to develop
   technologies for “deextinction”—the possibility of the latter being an
   especially dangerous misimpression (see ref. 23). Specifically, this
   approach has led to the neglect of two critical aspects of the present
   extinction episode: (i) the disappearance of populations, which
   essentially always precedes species extinctions, and (ii) the rapid
   decrease in numbers of individuals within some of the remaining
   populations. A detailed analysis of the loss of individuals and
   populations makes the problem much clearer and more worrisome, and
   highlights a whole set of parameters that are increasingly critical in
   considering the Anthropocene’s biological extinction crisis.

   In the last few decades, habitat loss, overexploitation, invasive
   organisms, pollution, toxification, and more recently climate
   disruption, as well as the interactions among these factors, have led
   to the catastrophic declines in both the numbers and sizes of
   populations of both common and rare vertebrate species (24⇓⇓⇓–28). For
   example, several species of mammals that were relatively safe one or
   two decades ago are now endangered. In 2016, there were only 7,000
   cheetahs in existence (29) and less than 5,000 Borneo and Sumatran
   orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus and P. abelli, respectively) (28).
   Populations of African lion (Panthera leo) dropped 43% since 1993 (30),
   pangolin (Manis spp.) populations have been decimated (31), and
   populations of giraffes dropped from around 115,000 individuals thought
   to be conspecific in 1985, to around 97,000 representing what is now
   recognized to be four species (Giraffa giraffa, G. tippelskirchi, G.
   reticulata, and G. camelopardalis) in 2015 (32).

   An important antecedent to our work (25) used the number of genetic
   populations per unit area and then estimated potential loss on the
   basis of deforestation estimates and the species–area relationship
   (SAR). Given the recognized limitations of the use of SAR to estimate
   extinctions, our work provides an approach based on reduction of
   species range as a proxy of population extirpation. The most recent
   Living Planet Index (LPI) has estimated that wildlife abundance on the
   planet decreased by as much as 58% between 1970 and 2012 (4). The
   present study is different from LPI and other related publications in
   several ways, including that here we use all decreasing species of
   vertebrates according to IUCN, mapping and comparing absolute and
   relative numbers of species, and focusing on population losses.
   Previous estimates seem validated by the data we present here on the
   loss of local populations and the severe decrease in the population
   size of many others (see also refs. 3, 4, 6⇓–8, 26). Here we examine
   the magnitude of losses of populations of land vertebrate species on a
   global system of 10,000-km^2 quadrats (Methods). Species vary from
   common to rare, so that our analysis, which includes all land
   vertebrate species (amphibians, birds, reptiles, and mammals) deemed as
   “decreasing” by IUCN, provides a better estimate of population losses
   than using exclusively IUCN data on species at risk. Obviously, common
   species decreasing are not ordinarily classified as species at risk.
   IUCN criteria provide quantitative thresholds for population size,
   trend, and range size, to determine decreasing species (28, 33). We
   also evaluate shrinking ranges and population declines for 177 species
   of mammals for which data are available on geographic range shrinkage
   from ∼1900 to 2015. We specifically focus on local extinctions by
   addressing the following questions: (i) What are the numbers and
   geographic distributions of decreasing terrestrial vertebrate species
   (i.e., experiencing population losses)? (ii) What are the vertebrate
   groups and geographic regions that have the highest numbers and
   proportions of decreasing species? (iii) What is the scale of local
   population declines in mammals—a proxy for other vertebrates? By
   addressing these questions, we conclude that anthropogenic population
   extinctions amount to a massive erosion of the greatest biological
   diversity in the history of Earth and that population losses and
   declines are especially important, because it is populations of
   organisms that primarily supply the ecosystem services so critical to
   humanity at local and regional levels.

Results

Patterns of Variation in Population Loss Among Vertebrates.

   Considering all land vertebrates, our spatially explicit analyses
   indicate a massive pulse of population losses, with a global epidemic
   of species declines. Those analyses support the view that the decay of
   vertebrate animal life is widespread geographically, crosses
   phylogenetic lineages, and involves species ranging in abundance from
   common to rare (Figs. 1–4). The losses, however, are not uniform: some
   regions exhibit higher concentrations of species with local population
   extinctions than others, including a strong latitudinal signal
   corresponding to an intertropical peak (i.e., roughly between the
   Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn) of number of decreasing species,
   particularly strong in mammals and birds, which largely drive the
   overall land vertebrate pattern (Fig. 3, Center). Notably, some parts
   of the planet harbor low absolute numbers of vertebrate species
   undergoing decline (Figs. 2 and 3), such as those areas of low species
   richness located in hypercold (northernmost locations, particularly of
   the Western Hemisphere) and hyperarid (Saharan Africa and Central Asia)
   regions. However, it is instructive to examine their corresponding
   proportional numbers, an aspect we discuss in detail in another section
   below.

   Decreasing land vertebrates, as exemplified with these four species,

   conservation status, current geographic range, and abundance are from

   the proportion of decreasing species per quadrat shows a strong
   high-latitude and Saharan Africa signal. In addition, there are several
   centers of population decline in both absolute and relative terms
   (Borneo, for example).

   Latitudinal distribution of species richness (Left), decreasing species

   population losses in relation to total species richness, in each

   latitude are similar in all vertebrates, although there are more
   species per quadrat in birds and mammals and, as expected, a scarcity
   of reptiles and amphibians at high latitudes. The patterns of number of
   species with decreasing populations indicate that regions with high
   species richness also have high numbers of decreasing species, but the
   percentage of decreasing species in relation to species richness shows
   contrasting patterns between mammals and birds compared with reptiles
   and amphibians. In mammals and birds, the percentage of decreasing
   species is relatively similar in regions with low and high species
   richness. In contrast, there are proportionally more decreasing species
   of reptiles and amphibians in regions with low species richness.

   The percentage of decreasing species classified by IUCN as “endangered”
   (including “critically endangered,” “endangered,” “vulnerable,” and
   “near-threatened”) or “low concern” (including “low concern” and
   “data-deficient”) in terrestrial vertebrates. This figure emphasizes
   that even species that have not yet been classified as endangered
   (roughly 30% in the case of all vertebrates) are declining. This
   situation is exacerbated in the case of birds, for which close to 55%
   of the decreasing species are still classified as “low concern.”

   The number of decreasing species of all land vertebrates in each of the
   10,000-km^2 quadrats over Earth’s land surface ranges from a few to
   more than 365 (Fig. 2). As expected, large concentrations of decreasing
   vertebrate species occur in species-rich areas of moist tropical
   forests adjacent to mountainous regions, such as the Andes–Amazon
   region, the Congo basin-adjacent eastern African highlands, and the
   Himalayas–south Asian jungle belt. The distribution of the number of
   decreasing species considering vertebrate classes separately reveals
   notable differences. First, the maximum number of decreasing species in
   a 10,000-km^2 quadrat varies from a high value of 296 decreasing birds
   per quadrat, to a low maximum of 60 decreasing reptiles in a quadrat.
   Second, mammals and birds have relatively similar distribution patterns
   of decreasing species, except that birds have more decreasing species
   in the temperate zones. Third, mammals and birds have patterns of
   decreasing species quite distinct from those of reptiles and amphibians
   (Figs. 2 and 3), given that the latter are rarer in the northern and
   southern temperate and subpolar regions (both are essentially absent
   from the Arctic and are missing from the Antarctic). Fourth, reptiles
   and amphibians clearly differ from each other in regions where
   decreasing species are concentrated. For example, there are more
   decreasing reptiles in the Eurasian and African continents, and more
   decreasing amphibians in the Americas.

   There is also great variation in the total population size and
   geographic ranges among individual species. Although there is no
   accurate information on population size for most taxa, whatever is
   available indicates that the total population size in species with
   decreasing populations varies from fewer than 100 individuals in
   critically endangered species such as the Hainan black-crested gibbon
   (Nomascus hainanus), to many millions of individuals in decreasing
   common species such as the barn swallow (Hirundo rustica). Similarly,
   the smallest ranges (i.e., <1 km^2) are seen in species such as the
   Carrizal seedeater (Amaurospiza carrizalensis) from Venezuela and
   Herrera’s false coral snake (Lampropeltis herrerae) from Mexico, both
   denizens of tiny islands. The largest ranges are hundreds of thousands
   of square kilometers, as in the bush dog (Speothos venaticus) from
   South America and the common lizard (Zootoca vivipara) from Eurasia.
   The sum of the 10,000-km^2 quadrats representing the current ranges of
   the 8,851 decreasing vertebrate species is 1,350,876 quadrats. A highly
   conservative estimate would indicate a similar number of local
   populations facing extinction. This is, of course, a very rough
   estimate of the total number of populations, as the number of
   populations of a decreasing species in each quadrat largely depends,
   aside from suitable habitat distribution within the quadrat, on animal
   body mass and trophic position (e.g., ref. 34). The assumption of one
   population per 10,000 km^2 might seem very conservative, as this area
   could accommodate many populations of small animals (e.g., 0.1-kg
   rodents), most of which could have been extirpated. However, 10,000
   km^2 may not be sufficient for, or can barely accommodate a viable
   population of large carnivores (say a 330-kg Siberian tiger; ref. 34).
   Nonetheless, our results provide evidence of the extremely large
   numbers of vertebrate populations facing extinction, compared with the
   number of species.

Proportion of Vertebrate Species Decreasing.

   The proportion of decreasing vertebrates shows that there are areas
   across the planet with high concentrations of decreasing species in all
   vertebrates and regions with high proportions of decreasing species of
   a particular group (Figs. 2, 3, and 5). For example, in mammals, the
   highest percentage of decreasing species is concentrated in tropical
   regions, mostly in the Neotropics and Southeast Asia, whereas in
   reptiles, the proportional decline concentrates almost exclusively in
   Madagascar. Decreasing amphibians are prominent in Mexico, Central
   America, the northern Andes, and Brazil’s Atlantic forest in the
   Americas; West Africa and Madagascar in Africa; and India and Southeast
   Asia, including Indonesia and Philippines in Asia–Southeast Asia.
   Finally, decreasing species of birds are found over large regions of
   all continents (Fig. 2).

   Fig. 5.

   The percentage of species of land mammals from five major
   continents/subcontinents and the entire globe undergoing different
   degrees (in percentage) of decline in the period ∼1900–2015.
   Considering the sampled species globally, 56% of them have lost more
   than 60% of their range, a pattern that is generally consistent in
   Africa, Asia, Australia, and Europe, whereas in South America and North
   America, 35–40% of the species have experienced range contractions of
   only 20% or less. (See text for details.)

   Roughly a third (8,851/27,600) of all land vertebrate species examined
   are experiencing declines and local population losses of a considerable
   magnitude (Figs. 2–4). Such proportion of decreasing species varies,
   depending on the taxonomic group, from 30% or more in the case of
   mammals, birds, and reptiles, to 15% in the case of amphibians.
   Furthermore, of the decreasing species, many are now considered
   endangered (Fig. 4). Beyond that, roughly 30% of all decreasing species
   are still sufficiently common that they are considered of “low concern”
   by IUCN, rather than “endangered.” That so many common species are
   decreasing is a strong sign of the seriousness of the overall
   contemporary biological extinction episode.

   In our 10,000-km^2 quadrats, the proportion of decreasing species
   ranges from less than 10% to more than 50% (Fig. 2). The geographic
   distributions of absolute (i.e., number) and relative (i.e.,
   percentage) of decreasing species is contrasting. Whereas tropical
   regions have larger numbers of decreasing species, as expected, given
   their higher species richness, their corresponding proportions are
   relatively low. In contrast, temperate regions tend to have similar or
   higher proportions of decreasing species, a trend dramatically
   prominent in the case of reptiles.

Local Population Extinctions in Mammals.

   Our most detailed data allow comparison of historic and present
   geographic range of a sample of 177 mammal species (Figs. 5 and 6).
   Most of the 177 mammal species we sampled have lost more than 40% of
   their geographic ranges in historic times, and almost half have lost
   more than 80% of their ranges in the period ∼1900–2015. At the
   continental and subcontinental level, some patterns become evident
   (Fig. 5). The predominant category of range contraction is ≥80% in
   Africa (56% of the sampled mammal species), Asia (75% of the species),
   Australia (60% of the species), and Europe (40% of the species). In the
   Americas, range contractions are less marked but still considerable:
   22% of the species in North America and 17% of the species in South
   America have experienced range contractions of at least 80%.
   Nevertheless, 50% of the species in North America and 28% of the
   species in South America have experienced a range contraction of 41% or
   more.

   Fig. 6.

   Percentage of local population extinction in 177 species of mammals in
   1° × 1° quadrats, as an indication of the severity of the mass
   extinction crises. The maps were generated by comparing historic and
   current geographic ranges (49) (SI Appendix, SI Methods). Note that
   large regions in all continents have lost 50% or more of the
   populations of the evaluated mammals. Because of the small sample size,
   biased to large mammal species, this figure can only be used to
   visualize likely trends in population losses.

   The comparison of the 1900–2015 geographic ranges showed that the 177
   species of mammals have disappeared from 58,000 grid cells. On the
   assumption that on average each of the 10,000-km^2 occupied quadrats
   held a single population of the species found within it, this implies
   that roughly 58,000 populations of the 177 mammals we examined have
   gone extinct. Consider the following emblematic cases: The lion
   (Panthera leo) was historically distributed over most of Africa,
   southern Europe, and the Middle East, all the way to northwestern India
   (SI Appendix, Fig. S1). It is now confined to scattered populations in
   sub-Saharan Africa and a remnant population in the Gir forest of India.
   The vast majority of lion populations are gone. In its African
   stronghold, it historically occupied roughly two thousand 10,000-km^2
   cells, and now it is reduced to some 600 cells. Other species, such as
   the mountain lion (Puma concolor), are known to be doing better. The
   mountain lion has lost some of its local populations in North America,
   but has not suffered such disastrous losses as its Old World relative,
   adapting relatively well to human-dominated landscapes, and it is still
   found across 85% of its historic range.

   Clearly, the extinction of mammal populations, although varying from
   species to species, has been a global phenomenon (Fig. 6). Strikingly,
   the predominant color code in the mammalian map is that of 70% or more
   of population losses, with the exception of some areas of South America
   and high latitudes of North America. Particularly hard hit have been
   the mammals of south and southeast Asia, where all of the large-bodied
   species of mammals analyzed have lost more than 80% of their geographic
   ranges. The Cape and Sahara regions in Africa, central Australia, the
   eastern United States, and the Atlantic forest in South America have
   also suffered severely from population extinctions.

Discussion

   It has recently been shown, using conservative estimates of current and
   background species extinction rates, that Earth is now in a period of
   mass global species extinction for vertebrate animals (11). But the
   true extent of this mass extinction has been underestimated, because of
   the emphasis on species extinction. This underestimate largely traces
   to overlooking the accelerating extinction of populations. Whereas
   scientists have known for a long time that several relatively
   well-studied species have undergone major contraction of their ranges,
   experienced considerable population decreases, and suffered many
   population extinctions, the global extent of population shrinkage and
   extirpation has previously not been recognized and quantified.

   In addition, some studies document that invertebrates and plants are
   suffering massive losses of populations and species (35⇓⇓–38). Here we
   extend investigation of mass extinction to terrestrial vertebrate
   population decreases and losses, and give estimates of the number of
   their species with decreasing populations. The accuracy of the
   estimates is strongly dependent on an unknown parameter, namely, the
   actual average area occupied by a vertebrate population (e.g., refs.
   35, 39⇓–41). However, even if a population would, on average, occupy an
   area five times larger than what we have used here (i.e., 50,000 km^2)
   there would still be hundreds of thousands of populations that have
   suffered extinction in the past few centuries. On the other hand, most
   vertebrates (∼70%) are small species of mammals, birds, reptiles, and
   amphibians. If, on average, they have one population every 10 km^2 then
   vertebrates would have suffered more than a billion population
   extinctions.

   Our results show that population extinction in land vertebrates is
   geographically omnipresent, but with notable prominence in tropical,
   species-rich regions. It is interesting, however, that when population
   extinctions are evaluated as the percentage of total species richness,
   temperate regions, with their typical low species diversity, show
   higher proportions of population loss.

   There are some illustrative qualitative examples of population
   decreases and their consequences within terrestrial and marine
   vertebrates, but ours is an attempt at a quantitative evaluation of
   global trends in population extinctions. Recent reviews indicate that
   species extinctions, population decreases, and range contraction
   (implying population extinctions) among terrestrial invertebrates and
   plants are as severe as among vertebrates (e.g., refs. 35⇓⇓–38). For
   example, long-term monitoring of insect populations in the United
   Kingdom shows that 30–60% of species per taxonomic order have
   contracting ranges (36). The situation in plants has been less
   evaluated; thus it is difficult to compare them with animals, but there
   is little reason to believe that the extinction situation in plants is
   dramatically different (37). Furthermore, research shows that the loss
   of animal populations indirectly leads to changes in plant communities
   (20, 37, 39), frequently causing the reduction of local species
   richness and dominance of a few plant taxa that either experience
   “ecological release” in response to decreasing herbivore pressures (42,
   43), and/or experience population reductions due to the decline of
   animals responsible for pollination or dispersal (e.g., refs. 2−3, 20).
   The status of biodiversity among microorganisms is too poorly known to
   permit us to make any comparison and generalizations about the current
   pulse of extinctions, although some recent research has unraveled
   feedbacks between local large herbivore defaunation and mycorrhizal
   richness (44, 45). Given what we know about genetic population
   differentiation, it is expected that the range contractions and
   declines we document here imply a considerable loss of intraspecific
   genetic diversity (23) but this is, clearly, an aspect that warrants
   further investigation.

   In sum, by losing populations (and species) of vertebrates, we are
   losing intricate ecological networks involving animals, plants, and
   microorganisms (e.g., refs. 2, 8, 18, 45, 46). We are also losing pools
   of genetic information that may prove vital to species’ evolutionary
   adjustment and survival in a rapidly changing global environment. This
   suggests that, even if there was not ample sign that the crisis extends
   far beyond that group of animals, today’s planetary defaunation of
   vertebrates will itself promote cascading catastrophic effects on
   ecosystems, worsening the annihilation of nature (2, 3, 46). Thus,
   while the biosphere is undergoing mass species extinction (11), it is
   also being ravaged by a much more serious and rapid wave of population
   declines and extinctions. In combination, these assaults are causing a
   vast reduction of the fauna and flora of our planet. The resulting
   biological annihilation obviously will also have serious ecological,
   economic, and social consequences (46). Humanity will eventually pay a
   very high price for the decimation of the only assemblage of life that
   we know of in the universe.

Conclusion

   Population extinctions today are orders of magnitude more frequent than
   species extinctions. Population extinctions, however, are a prelude to
   species extinctions, so Earth’s sixth mass extinction episode has
   proceeded further than most assume. The massive loss of populations is
   already damaging the services ecosystems provide to civilization. When
   considering this frightening assault on the foundations of human
   civilization, one must never forget that Earth’s capacity to support
   life, including human life, has been shaped by life itself (47). When
   public mention is made of the extinction crisis, it usually focuses on
   a few animal species (hundreds out of millions) known to have gone
   extinct, and projecting many more extinctions in the future. But a
   glance at our maps presents a much more realistic picture: they suggest
   that as much as 50% of the number of animal individuals that once
   shared Earth with us are already gone, as are billions of populations.
   Furthermore, our analysis is conservative, given the increasing
   trajectories of the drivers of extinction and their synergistic
   effects. Future losses easily may amount to a further rapid defaunation
   of the globe and comparable losses in the diversity of plants (36),
   including the local (and eventually global) defaunation-driven
   coextinction of plants (3, 20). The likelihood of this rapid
   defaunation lies in the proximate causes of population extinctions:
   habitat conversion, climate disruption, overexploitation, toxification,
   species invasions, disease, and (potentially) large-scale nuclear
   war—all tied to one another in complex patterns and usually reinforcing
   each other’s impacts. Much less frequently mentioned are, however, the
   ultimate drivers of those immediate causes of biotic destruction,
   namely, human overpopulation and continued population growth, and
   overconsumption, especially by the rich. These drivers, all of which
   trace to the fiction that perpetual growth can occur on a finite
   planet, are themselves increasing rapidly. Thus, we emphasize that the
   sixth mass extinction is already here and the window for effective
   action is very short, probably two or three decades at most (11, 48).
   All signs point to ever more powerful assaults on biodiversity in the
   next two decades, painting a dismal picture of the future of life,
   including human life.

Methods

   For full methods, please see SI Appendix. We determined the number of
   decreasing vertebrate species using the IUCN (28) Red List of
   Threatened Species. In the IUCN, species are classified as decreasing,
   stable, or increasing (see also ref. 33). Either range contraction
   (population extinction) or reduction in numbers in extant populations
   determines whether a species is decreasing. We used the IUCN maps of
   terrestrial vertebrates (i.e., mammals, birds, reptiles, and
   amphibians) to create the global maps of number of species (richness)
   and of decreasing species, and percentage of decreasing species in
   relation to total species richness. The distribution of all of the
   species was superimposed in a 22,000 grid of 10,000-km^2 quadrats
   covering the continental lands. For the grid, a Lambert azimuthal
   equal-area projection was used (see ref. 49 for details of the
   projection methods). In our analyses a critical issue is how grid
   squares and populations correspond. This is a very difficult problem
   that varies with definitions of species. (In this paper, we stick with
   the classic biological definition of species.) The number of
   populations also varies from species to species; for example, a highly
   phylopatric species would have more populations per square than a very
   vagile species, and species with different mating systems would have
   different estimates of numbers of Mendelian populations, and these
   would not be the same as estimates of number of demographic units (50).
   For the purposes of understanding the annihilation, these differences
   are not critical. For example, if we have lost 90% of the lion’s
   geographic range, whether this amounts to 10,000 demographic units or
   4,000 Mendelian populations is trivial in the present context. It would
   be extremely useful if we had much more information on population
   structure for all vertebrates, but this is a major, pending agenda.

   The population extinction analysis was conducted on 177 mammalian
   species occurring on five continents. Specifically, we analyzed 54
   species in Africa, 14 in Asia, 57 in Australia, 15 in Europe, and 35 in
   America. The historical distribution was gathered from specialized
   literature (see details in ref. 26) and the current distribution from
   IUCN (28). Historic and current ranges were digitized as geographic
   information system polygons and elaborated in ArcGis 10.1 (51). For
   each species, we calculated the area of the historical and present
   distribution (in square kilometers) to estimate the percentage of lost
   area and the percentage of area where the species are extant. A caveat
   of these estimates regards how representative the sample of 177 species
   is. We recognize a bias in that the data include a large number of
   medium- and large-sized species, for which the best information is
   available. However, given that such medium and large species are the
   most seriously threatened by the predominant proximate drivers of
   defaunation (2, 3), the likely bias against small-sized species should
   not affect our overall interpretation of results.

Abstract

   Global food demand is increasing rapidly, as are the environmental
   impacts of agricultural expansion. Here, we project global demand for
   crop production in 2050 and evaluate the environmental impacts of
   alternative ways that this demand might be met. We find that per capita
   demand for crops, when measured as caloric or protein content of all
   crops combined, has been a similarly increasing function of per capita
   real income since 1960. This relationship forecasts a 100–110% increase
   in global crop demand from 2005 to 2050. Quantitative assessments show
   that the environmental impacts of meeting this demand depend on how
   global agriculture expands. If current trends of greater agricultural
   intensification in richer nations and greater land clearing
   (extensification) in poorer nations were to continue, ∼1 billion ha of
   land would be cleared globally by 2050, with CO[2]-C equivalent
   greenhouse gas emissions reaching ∼3 Gt y^−1 and N use ∼250 Mt y^−1 by
   then. In contrast, if 2050 crop demand was met by moderate
   intensification focused on existing croplands of underyielding nations,
   adaptation and transfer of high-yielding technologies to these
   croplands, and global technological improvements, our analyses forecast
   land clearing of only ∼0.2 billion ha, greenhouse gas emissions of ∼1
   Gt y^−1, and global N use of ∼225 Mt y^−1. Efficient management
   practices could substantially lower nitrogen use. Attainment of high
   yields on existing croplands of underyielding nations is of great
   importance if global crop demand is to be met with minimal
   environmental impacts.

   Global demand for agricultural crops is increasing, and may continue to
   do so for decades, propelled by a 2.3 billion person increase in global
   population and greater per capita incomes anticipated through
   midcentury (1). Both land clearing and more intensive use of existing
   croplands could contribute to the increased crop production needed to
   meet such demand, but the environmental impacts and tradeoffs of these
   alternative paths of agricultural expansion are unclear (1, 2).
   Agriculture already has major global environmental impacts: land
   clearing and habitat fragmentation threaten biodiversity (3), about
   one-quarter of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions result from land
   clearing, crop production, and fertilization (4), and fertilizer can
   harm marine, freshwater, and terrestrial ecosystems (5). Understanding
   the future environmental impacts of global crop production and how to
   achieve greater yields with lower impacts requires quantitative
   assessments of future crop demand and how different production
   practices affect yields and environmental variables.

   Here, we forecast 2050 global crop demand and then quantitatively
   evaluate the global impacts on land clearing, nitrogen fertilizer use,
   and GHG release of alternative approaches by which this global crop
   demand might be achieved. To do these analyses, we compiled annual
   agricultural and population data for 1961–2007 obtained from the
   FAOSTAT database (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
   Nations; http://faostat.fao.org/) and other sources (SI Materials and
   Methods) for each of 100 large nations that comprised 91% of the 2006
   global population (Table S1). We then calculated net national demand
   for crop calories and crop protein for each nation for each year based
   on national annual yields, production, imports, and exports of 275
   major crops (those crops used as human foods or livestock and fish
   feeds) (Table S2). The resultant per capita demand for calories or
   protein from all food or feed crops combined (SI Materials and Methods)
   encompasses annual human crop consumption, crop use for livestock and
   fish production, and all losses (waste and spoilage during food and
   crop production, storage, transport, and manufacturing). To determine
   long-term global trends and better control for economic differences
   among nations, nations were aggregated into seven economic groups
   ranging from highest (Group A) to lowest (Group G) national average per
   capita real (inflation-adjusted) gross domestic product (GDP) (Table
   S1).

Results and Discussion

Global Crop Demand.

   Analyses reveal a simple and temporally consistent global relationship
   between per capita GDP and per capita demand for crop calories or
   protein. Across all years, per capita crop use was similarly dependent
   on per capita GDP both within and among the seven economic groups (Fig.
   1). The magnitude of this dependence is surprisingly large. In 2000,
   for example, per capita use of calories and protein by the richest
   nations (Group A) were 256% and 430% greater, respectively, than use by
   the poorest nations (Groups F and G). These large differences in crop
   demand partially result from greater dietary meat consumption at higher
   income (6, 7) and the low efficiency with which some types of livestock
   convert crop calories and protein into edible foods (8).

   Annual dependence of per capita demand for (A) crop calories and (B)
   protein on per capita real GDP for each of economic Groups A–G (SI
   Materials and Methods). Each color of points shows the trajectory for a
   particular economic group (one point per year for each group). Curves
   are fitted to the square root of per capita GDP.

   We suggest that the observed relationships between per capita crop use
   and per capita real GDP (Fig. 1) provide a means of forecasting future
   crop demand. Specifically, using the fitted curves in Fig. 1, we
   forecasted per capita crop caloric and protein demand for 2050 for each
   economic group by its estimated 2050 per capita GDP (Fig. 2 B and C)
   (Table S3). The GDP estimate (SI Materials and Methods and Fig. S1)
   assumes that per capita real GDP would grow at ∼2.5% per year globally,
   with rates for developing nations being greater than developed nations
   (Fig. 2A). Using United Nations (UN) projections of 2050 population (9)
   (Fig. S2), we next calculated the total 2050 demand for crop calories
   or crop protein for each economic group and then summed these values to
   estimate 2050 global crop demand (SI Materials and Methods).

   (A) Per capita GDP, (B) per capita demand for crop calories, and (C)
   per capita demand for crop protein in 2005 (black) and mean projected
   2050 increases (white; percent increases above bars).

   These analyses forecast that global demand for crop calories would
   increase by 100% ± 11% and global demand for crop protein would
   increase by 110% ± 7% (mean ± SE) from 2005 to 2050 (Table S3). This
   projected doubling is lower than the 176% (caloric) and 238% (protein)
   increases in global crop use that would occur if per capita demands of
   all nations in 2050 reached the 2005 levels of Group A nations.

   Any projection of future global crop production entails many elements
   of uncertainty and of necessity emphasizes some potentially causative
   factors over others. Our forecast of a 100–110% increase in global crop
   production by 2050 is larger than the 70% increase that has been
   projected for this same period (10). Although our projection methods
   and the methods of the earlier study differ in many ways, the different
   forecasts may occur because of our use of quantitative global trends in
   per capita crop demand that emphasize income-dependent dietary choices
   (Fig. 1) vs. their use of expert opinion of national and regional
   demand trends (10).

Quantification of Yield, Input, and Climate Relationships.

   The environmental impacts of doubling global crop production will
   depend on how increased production is achieved (11, 12). Production
   could be increased by agricultural extensification (that is, clearing
   additional land for crop production) or intensification (that is,
   achieving higher yields through increased inputs, improved agronomic
   practices, improved crop varieties, and other innovations). Here, we
   quantify the global impacts on land clearing, GHG emissions, and
   nitrogen fertilization of alternative pathways of agricultural
   development that meet the 2050 global crop production that we forecast.
   In particular, we evaluate the combinations of current or improved
   agricultural technologies, enhancements to soil fertility, and land
   clearing that could meet our projected 2050 global caloric demand and
   what their environmental impacts would be. For brevity, results for
   protein are not presented here but are similar. Because of data
   availability, we use past N fertilization rates as quantitative
   measures of soil fertility enhancement, but we emphasize that soil
   fertility can also be enhanced by legumes, cover crops, and other means
   and that yields could increase with less N fertilizer than in the past
   if N use efficiency increases (1, 2, 13).

   We used multiple regressions to quantify how nation to nation and year
   to year differences in caloric yields have been related to N
   fertilization intensity (N ha^−1) and other variables that are thought
   to impact yields (SI Materials and Methods). We found that caloric
   yields were simultaneously related to N fertilization intensity,
   precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, soil pH, elevation, time
   (year), and economic group (Table S4). A simpler regression that
   included just N fertilization intensity, precipitation, economic group,
   and time gave similar results (Table S4). Two otherwise similar
   regressions used just 2005 data (Table S5).

   These four regressions show that ∼80% of national-level variation in
   caloric yields was statistically explained by a few underlying
   variables. We use these fitted relationships to quantify scenarios,
   exploring the potential effects of changes in these variables on
   caloric yields and the environment. We do so with the caveat that the
   fitted relationships need not be indicative of causation, while noting
   that fits are consistent with other analyses of controls of yields (12,
   14, 15).

   After controlling for N fertilization intensity, climate, soil, and
   elevation in these regressions, we will, for brevity, refer to the
   residual yield differences ascribed to economic groups as mainly
   reflecting technological and infrastructure disparities among the
   economic groups, and we will refer to the residual yield differences
   that are ascribed to time (year) as mainly reflecting technological
   improvements from 1965 to 2005.

Alternative Pathways of Agricultural Expansion.

   These regressions can estimate the dependence of global yields on N use
   (soil fertility enhancement) if future technological advances were to
   continue along observed temporal trends to 2050 (technology
   improvement), if underyielding nations were to overcome technological
   disparities by adapting and then adopting the high-yielding
   technologies of Group A nations (technology transfer), or if both
   technology improvement and technology transfer were to occur. In
   particular, we used our regression results to quantify curves defining
   the dependence of global caloric yields on global N use for four cases
   that all meet our projected 2050 crop caloric demand forecast (Fig. 3A
   and SI Materials and Methods). For all cases, we assumed that the
   currently large disparities among nations in agricultural intensities
   (measured here as N ha^−1) were eliminated by 2050. We call this
   equalization of N use strategic N utilization, because it provides a
   larger increase in global crop production per unit of N than would
   occur from greater N use in nations already applying N at high rates.

   yields and environmental impacts of four alternative hypothetical
   trajectories along which agriculture might develop by 2050. Tonnes
   CO[2]e in (C) and (F) represents the equivalent tonnes of C that would
   have been emitted had all GHG emissions in our analyses been in the
   form of CO[2]. All abscissas are global annual N use in 2050 calculated
   as the sum across all economic groups of N use intensity (N ha^−1)
   times total cropland area (ha) needed to meet projected 2050 caloric
   demand. To derive the curves shown, current N use intensities of
   lower-yielding nations were strategically increased to equal global
   mean intensity, which was set at 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, or 160 kg ha^−1
   to calculate the 12 points shown for each curve (SI Materials and
   Methods). The four curves shown in each graph (magenta, current
   technology; blue, improvement only; orange, technology adaptation and
   transfer only; green, improvement and technology transfer) are
   regression-based estimates of yields (A and D) and associated land
   clearing (B and E) needed to meet 2050 global caloric demand and
   resultant GHG emissions (C and F). Land clearing = (cropland needed to
   meet 2050 crop demand) − (2005 cropland).

   The current technology curve in Fig. 3 retains each economic group's
   N-dependent yield at its 2005 relationship and thus assumes no
   technological improvements or transfer from 2005 to 2050. This curve
   provides a potential lower bound for 2050 yields. It is defined by six
   data points calculated from each of the two regressions that used just
   2005 data (Table S5). These two regressions, which differ in the number
   of variables included, give results so similar to each other as to be
   almost indistinguishable in Fig. 3 A–C.

   A potential upper bound is provided by the technology improvement and
   transfer curve for which complete technology transfer is assumed to
   allow all nations to achieve (by 2050) the technological improvements
   and soil- and climate-adjusted yields projected for Group A nations by
   2050. The two regressions on which it is based also gave highly similar
   predictions (Fig. 3 A–C and Table S4).

   Two intermediate curves, each defined by two regressions, provide
   benchmarks within the region defined by the upper and lower bounds. The
   technology improvement curve assumes that yields continue to increase
   until 2050 along the 1965–2005 time trajectory (Table S4) but that all
   nations otherwise retain the technology of their economic group. The
   technology transfer curve has each nation, based on its climate and
   soils, achieve (in 2050) the climate- and soil-adjusted N-dependent
   yield of Group A nations in 2005 (Table S5). All four curves in Fig. 3
   explore what might occur should lower-yielding nations achieve, by
   2050, significant soil fertility enhancements (here quantified by
   increased N use but potentially achievable by other means).

   Any point in the shaded region of Fig. 3A represents different
   combinations of technology improvement and technology transfer that,
   for the given global N use or its equivalent soil fertility
   enhancement, would meet global caloric demand in 2050. The increased
   global yields that could result from various degrees of technology
   improvement, technology transfer, or N use would meet 2050 crop demand
   with less cropland clearing (1, 2) (Fig. 3B). For instance, if global N
   use were held at 200 Mt, achieving the technology transfer and
   improvement benchmark by 2050 would decrease land clearing by ∼1.2
   billion ha compared with current yields (Fig. 3B).

   Land clearing, soil cultivation, and N fertilizer manufacturing and use
   all emit GHG. We quantified global emissions from these sources for
   each curve using Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Tier
   1 methods (16, 17) (SI Materials and Methods and Tables S6 and S7).
   Although estimates of N[2]O emissions that result from N fertilizer are
   variable (18), such variability is small compared with the other
   sources of emissions that we quantified. Our analyses found that, when
   increased global N is focused on croplands of underyielding nations,
   projected global 2050 net GHG emissions are reduced, as shown by the
   negative slopes for each of the four curves of Fig. 3C. Reduced GHG
   emissions occurred because increased N use decreased land clearing. The
   resultant reduction in GHG emissions from lower land clearing was
   approximately three times the emissions increase from the N fertilizer.

Environmental Impacts of Meeting Increased Crop Demand.

   These relationships among global N use, yield, land clearing, and GHG
   emissions allow exploration of the environmental impacts of different
   pathways of global agricultural development. Four hypothetical pathways
   that start on the current technology curve at the 2005 global average N
   use intensity of 94 kg ha^−1 (Fig. 3 D–F) illustrate that our forecast
   of 2050 global crop demand may be met in ways that have markedly
   different environmental impacts. First, consider a pathway that mimics
   past trends (black arrows), with poorer, lower-yielding nations
   increasing crop production mainly through land clearing and richer,
   higher-yielding nations doing so mainly by yield increases from
   intensification and yield improvement. The environmental impacts of
   this past trend trajectory would, as illustrated, increase global land
   clearing to a total of ∼1 billion ha by 2050, global agricultural GHG
   emissions to ∼3 Gt y^−1 of CO[2]-carbon equivalents, and global N use
   to ∼250 Mt y^−1. These increases would have major environmental impacts
   through resultant species extinctions, loss of ecosystem services,
   elevated atmospheric GHG levels, and water pollution (3–5, 19).

   Greater global investments in technology improvement and technology
   adaptation and transfer could markedly reduce these impacts, as
   illustrated by the other three trajectories, all of which attain the
   technology improvement and technology adaptation and transfer frontier
   by 2050. For instance, the N-minimizing trajectory shown (brown arrows)
   (Fig. 3 D–F) could retain global N use at its current 100 Mt y^−1, have
   land clearing of ∼0.5 billion ha, and have GHG emissions of 1.6 Gt
   y^−1. Alternatively, a current N-intensity trajectory (yellow arrows),
   with global N intensity staying at 94 kg ha^−1 until 2050, would move
   global values to N use of ∼125 Mt, land clearing of ∼0.4 billion ha,
   and GHG emissions of ∼1.4 Gt y^−1 in 2050.

   A land sparing trajectory (white arrows) would minimize both land
   clearing and GHG emissions. It could meet our 2050 projected global
   crop demand while clearing only ∼0.2 billion ha land globally and
   producing global GHG emissions of just ∼1 Gt y^−1. Global N use would
   be ∼225 Mt y^−1. This analysis suggests that a land sparing trajectory
   of agricultural development might be the best option for minimizing
   biodiversity loss and GHG emissions, but it comes with the
   environmental cost associated with greater global N use.

   However, a variety of practices can greatly decrease this environmental
   cost by increasing the efficiency of agricultural nitrogen utilization
   (1, 11–13, 20, 21). For instance, recent field trials of an integrated
   soil–crop management system in China achieved a 90% increase in maize
   yields with no increase in N use (13). Because N inputs in excess of
   plant uptake increase nitrate loading into surface and ground waters
   and contribute to marine anoxic zones (20, 22), greater development and
   adoption of agronomic practices that increase nutrient efficiency (23,
   24) could further decrease environmental impacts of increased yields
   (25–27).

Conclusions

   Trajectories of global agricultural development that are directed to
   greater achievement of the technology improvement and technology
   transfer frontier would meet 2050 crop demand with much lower
   environmental impacts than trajectories that were continuations of past
   trends (19). This difference occurs because strategic intensification
   that elevates yields of existing croplands of underyielding nations can
   meet the majority of 2050 global crop demand, and in so doing can
   greatly reduce land clearing and GHG emissions.

   Current yield differences among nations are large. In 2005, for
   example, caloric yields for Group A nations were 308% greater than for
   Groups F and G, 138% greater than for Group E, and 37% greater than for
   Groups B, C, and D. Our analyses, which incorporate the effects of
   climate and soils on yields, suggest that agricultural intensification
   through technology adaptation and transfer and enhancement of soil
   fertility in poorer nations would greatly reduce these yield gaps (14),
   provide a more equitable global food supply, and greatly decrease the
   GHG emissions and species extinctions that otherwise would have
   resulted from land clearing (4). Our analyses explore the implications
   of the 100% increase from 2005 to 2050 in global crop production that
   we forecast. If global crop demand were lower (10), less land clearing
   and/or N use would be needed, and environmental impacts would be
   smaller.

   Our evaluations of the environmental benefits of alternative pathways
   of global agricultural development are not meant to imply that they
   might be similarly attainable or feasible. Global yields will likely be
   impacted by climate change (15). Yield increases in richer nations may
   be more difficult than in the past if some major crops are approaching
   yield ceilings (21, 28). Yield increases in poorer nations will require
   significant investments in innovative adaptation of technologies to new
   soil types, climates, and pests (29, 30) as well as new infrastructure
   (2). However, yields have been increased in some nations in which they
   were long stagnant, such as Malawi and Zimbabwe (31, 32). In Zimbabwe,
   for instance, field trials on >1,200 farms showed that technology
   transfer (farmer education) and intensification (N fertilizer use at
   ∼13% of use by Group A nations) increased maize yields 40%, giving
   market value returns ∼400% greater than the cost of fertilization (32).

   Global food demand is growing rapidly, much of the world's current
   cropland has yields well below their potential, and the current global
   trajectory of agricultural expansion has serious long-term implications
   for the environment. The environmental impacts of escalating crop
   demand will depend on the trajectory along which global agriculture
   develops. The preservation of global biodiversity and the minimization
   of the GHG impacts of agriculture may well hinge on this trajectory. A
   trajectory that adapts and transfers technologies to underyielding
   nations, enhances their soil fertility, employs more efficient nutrient
   use worldwide, and minimizes land clearing provides a promising path to
   more environmentally sustainable agricultural intensification and more
   equitable global food supplies.

Significance

   Humans alter the water cycle by constructing dams and through water
   withdrawals. Climate change is expected to additionally affect water
   supply and demand. Here, model analyses of climate change and direct
   human impacts on the terrestrial water cycle are presented. The results
   indicate that the impact of man-made reservoirs and water withdrawals
   on the long-term global terrestrial water balance is small. However, in
   some river basins, impacts of human interventions are significant. In
   parts of Asia and the United States, the effects of human interventions
   exceed the impacts expected for moderate levels of global warming. This
   study also identifies areas where irrigation water is currently scarce,
   and where increases in irrigation water scarcity are projected.

Abstract

   Humans directly change the dynamics of the water cycle through dams
   constructed for water storage, and through water withdrawals for
   industrial, agricultural, or domestic purposes. Climate change is
   expected to additionally affect water supply and demand. Here, analyses
   of climate change and direct human impacts on the terrestrial water
   cycle are presented and compared using a multimodel approach. Seven
   global hydrological models have been forced with multiple climate
   projections, and with and without taking into account impacts of human
   interventions such as dams and water withdrawals on the hydrological
   cycle. Model results are analyzed for different levels of global
   warming, allowing for analyses in line with temperature targets for
   climate change mitigation. The results indicate that direct human
   impacts on the water cycle in some regions, e.g., parts of Asia and in
   the western United States, are of the same order of magnitude, or even
   exceed impacts to be expected for moderate levels of global warming (+2
   K). Despite some spread in model projections, irrigation water
   consumption is generally projected to increase with higher global mean
   temperatures. Irrigation water scarcity is particularly large in parts
   of southern and eastern Asia, and is expected to become even larger in
   the future.

Abstract

   Water scarcity severely impairs food security and economic prosperity
   in many countries today. Expected future population changes will, in
   many countries as well as globally, increase the pressure on available
   water resources. On the supply side, renewable water resources will be
   affected by projected changes in precipitation patterns, temperature,
   and other climate variables. Here we use a large ensemble of global
   hydrological models (GHMs) forced by five global climate models and the
   latest greenhouse-gas concentration scenarios (Representative
   Concentration Pathways) to synthesize the current knowledge about
   climate change impacts on water resources. We show that climate change
   is likely to exacerbate regional and global water scarcity
   considerably. In particular, the ensemble average projects that a
   global warming of 2 °C above present (approximately 2.7 °C above
   preindustrial) will confront an additional approximate 15% of the
   global population with a severe decrease in water resources and will
   increase the number of people living under absolute water scarcity
   (<500 m^3 per capita per year) by another 40% (according to some
   models, more than 100%) compared with the effect of population growth
   alone. For some indicators of moderate impacts, the steepest increase
   is seen between the present day and 2 °C, whereas indicators of very
   severe impacts increase unabated beyond 2 °C. At the same time, the
   study highlights large uncertainties associated with these estimates,
   with both global climate models and GHMs contributing to the spread.
   GHM uncertainty is particularly dominant in many regions affected by
   declining water resources, suggesting a high potential for improved
   water resource projections through hydrological model development.
