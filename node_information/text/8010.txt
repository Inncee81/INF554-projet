Productivity in Education and Agriculture


   Productivity in Higher Education
   How do the benefits of higher education compare with its costs, and how
   does this vary across individuals and institutions? Productivity in
   Higher Education uses rich and novel administrative data, modern
   econometric methods, and deep institutional understanding to explore
   these issues. Researchers examine the returns to undergraduate
   education, differences in costs by major, the productivity of
   for-profit schools, the productivity of various types of faculty, the
   effects of online education on the market, and the ways in which the
   productivity of institutions responds to market forces. Edited by
   Caroline M. Hoxby and Kevin Stange.
                                                   Additional information
   Agricultural Productivity and Producer Behavior
   While agricultural yields have increased steadily in the last half
   century, inflation-adjusted agricultural commodity prices have been
   trending downward as increases in supply outpace the growth of demand.
   Yet recent severe weather events, biofuel mandates, and a switch toward
   a more meat-heavy diet in emerging economies have boosted prices.
   Whether this is a temporary jump or the beginning of a longer-term
   trend is an open question. Agricultural Productivity and Producer
   Behavior explores issues including potential environmental consequences
   of yield growth, genetically modified crops, changing climatic factors,
   production responses to government regulations, and the role of crop
   diversification, disease management, and water-saving methods. Edited
   by Wolfram Schlenker.

Did the War on Terror Ignite an Opioid Epidemic?

   Combat service in Afghanistan and Iraq has substantially increased the
   risk of prescription painkiller abuse and illicit heroin use among
   active duty servicemen, Resul Cesur, Joseph J. Sabia, and W. David
   Bradford find. Veterans are overdosing at twice the rate of civilians.

Price Changes Drive Shoppers' Inflation Expectations

   Many consumers rely on the frequency and size of grocery price changes
   to form their inflation expectations, according to a study by Francesco
   D’Acunto, Ulrike Malmendier, Juan Ospina, and Michael Weber. Many
   central banks, however, focus on inflation measures that exclude
   grocery prices.

Long-Run Impacts of School Suspensions on Adult Crime

   Students assigned to a school that has a one standard deviation higher
   suspension rate have lower educational attainment and are 15 to 20
   percent more likely to be arrested and incarcerated as adults, Andrew
   Bacher-Hicks, Stephen B. Billings, and David J. Deming find.

Bulletin on Health

Federally Mandated Medicaid Reimbursement Increases
Expanded Patient Access to Care, While They Lasted

   [w26095.jpg]
   The fall issue of the Bulletin on Health features a study of increases
   in Medicaid reimbursement rates that were federally mandated from 2013
   to 2015. This policy change increased Medicaid payments for certain
   primary care services by 60 percent, on average, and substantially
   reduced geographic dispersion in the level of payments. Researchers
   find that the increased reimbursement expanded access to care, improved
   self-reported health, and reduced school absences among primary
   school-aged children. Also featured in the fall issue of the Bulletin
   on Health are studies of birth outcomes at hospitals with relatively
   high c-section rates, and the longevity of Medicare beneficiaries who
   move from one location to another.

How Republican and Democratic Investors
Reacted to the Outcome of the 2016 Election

   Jonathan Parker
   The marked change in national leadership — both at the level of
   individual politicians and national parties — following the 2016
   election produced a sharp change in investment behaviors, as households
   in predominantly Democratic zip codes tended to sell out of the stock
   market and buy into safe assets while those in Republican dominated zip
   codes bought into the market and sold safe assets to finance those
   investments. A study of why that happened was made by Jonathan A.
   Parker, Maarten Meeuwis, Antoinette Schoar, and Duncan I. Simester.

Foreclosures Found to Exacerbate Housing Downturns
by Excluding Defaulters from Market and Straining Banks

   [w26216.jpg]
   Foreclosures of homeowners deepen downward spirals in the housing
   market by excluding those who default from the market, tightening
   constraints on banks, and making potential buyers more picky, according
   to an analysis of the 2006–13 period featured in the current edition of
   the free, monthly NBER Digest. Also featured in the November issue are
   working papers exploring: the preferred locations of American
   inventors, the first four years of the Affordable Care Act, signs of
   stagnation in the developed world's economy, and the effects of the
   Common Application on the college admissions process and new strategies
   for improving tax collection in developing countries.

In '80s and '90s, Low Unemployment and Inflation
Were Associated with Robust Growth. Why Not Now?

   [haltiwangerfigure2.jpg]
   Declines in both the startup of new businesses and the reallocation of
   workers potentially are related to the aggregate decline in
   productivity growth in the United States, according to research
   discussed in the current edition of the NBER Reporter. Also in this
   issue of the free NBER quarterly are reports on long-term unemployment,
   evidence-based health care policy, belief formation, and analysis of
   violent conflict.

Effects of Mandatory State-Level Medigap Coverage
To the Under-65 Medicare-Eligible Population

   [w25564.jpg]
   Research summarized in the current issue of the Bulletin in Retirement
   and Disability shows that states requiring Medigap insurers to offer at
   least one Medigap plan to the under-65 Medicare population measurably
   and substantially improves that population's health. Also in the
   current issue, are summaries of the 2019 Retirement and Disability
   Research Consortium Meeting held August 1-2 at the National Press Club
   in Washington, DC, research on the effects of Medicaid privatization in
   Texas, and a panel discussion on the economic determinants of fertility
   decisions held this past July at the NBER Summer Institute's Social
   Security meeting.

If Unconventional Policies Are Swiftly Adopted,
the Zero Lower Bound May Actually Be Irrelevant

   Davide Debortoli
   The global financial crisis of 2007–08 and the recession that followed
   led many central banks to lower rates down to near zero — their
   theoretical lower bound. Given the impossibility of further reductions
   in the short-term nominal rate, which is the usual instrument of
   monetary policy in normal times — central banks increasingly relied on
   unconventional monetary policies. A study presented at this year's NBER
   Annual Conference on Macroeconomics found that, in the case of the
   United States, it worked.
