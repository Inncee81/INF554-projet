   What is the Intel® Developer Zone?
          The Intel® Developer Zone is a global site designed to engage
          the software community with insights, information, expertise,
          and tools to help drive innovation and success among developers
          who work in the Intel software environment. The program provides
          opportunities for members to connect and collaborate, share
          knowledge, learn, and grow professionally. In addition, members
          have access to a wide variety of opportunities to market and
          sell their software and apps directly to consumers, as well as
          tap into promotional and funding opportunities to help them grow
          their businesses.

          Evolving technologies, growing customer expectations, and
          heightened consumer experiences—the business of creating
          best-selling software and popular apps changes from day to day.
          The Intel Developer Zone provides the perspective and resources
          software professionals need to plan for and react to these
          shifts.

   Intel makes processors—how does that relate to software?
          Intel® processors power a huge range of devices—from Macs* and
          PCs to smartphones, tablets, and OEM devices. As a result, we
          need to pay attention to the software that runs on those devices
          in our constant pursuit of better user experiences. This puts
          Intel in a unique position to help developers make the most of
          their efforts across a variety of form factors, operating
          systems, and platforms.

   Who uses the Intel Developer Zone?
          The Intel Developer Zone was created for software professionals
          engaged in creating, developing, marketing, selling, and
          distributing software and apps. Our website provides development
          support, software resources, and market opportunities to
          everyone from seasoned developers and global software businesses
          to students and software startups.

   Is this a worldwide program?
          Yes. The program provides opportunities to sell and distribute
          software and apps directly to customers in 45 countries and
          provides access to content in English, Spanish, French, Italian,
          German, Russian, Portuguese, and Chinese. In addition,
          developers can connect and collaborate with Intel experts
          worldwide and engage with a community of peers, students, and
          educators from over 150 countries to share development advice
          and business opportunities, answer questions, and gather
          information on new platforms, technologies, and techniques.

   How does registration work?
          A developer can register to post comments to forums and access a
          variety of technical content and resources. Additional
          requirements to access premium business resources may apply.

   Does it cost anything to join?
          No. There are no costs to join the program or to access nearly
          all of our resources.

   What is the Intel login?
          Before you create a new login ID, you should know that many
          Intel systems allow you to use the same login ID. For example:

          + If you have registered any Intel® Software Development
            Products (i.e., Intel® VTune™ Performance Analyzer), then use
            your Intel® Registration Center login ID.
          + If you have submitted a support request using Intel Premier
            Support, then you should already have a login ID.
          + If you are a member of the Intel Software Partner Program,
            then you should already have a login ID.

          If you think you already have an account, here are some useful
          links:

          + Log in with your existing login ID
          + Enter your email address and get your login ID
          + Enter your login ID and get your password
          + Sign In FAQ

   What are the Intel password guidelines?
          The following password rules are for both the Registration
          Center and for Premier Support.

          + The password must be at least eight characters long, and can
            contain letters, numbers, and punctuation.
          + It must not exceed fourteen (14) characters.
          + It must contain at least one alpha character [a-z; A-Z], one
            numeric [0-9] and one special character [`!
            @$%^&*()-_=+[];:'",<.>/?].
          + It cannot contain spaces.
          + The password cannot be the same as any of your previous eight
            (8) passwords.
          + It cannot contain your login id.
          + It may not contain any of the following special characters:
            Asterisk (*) Comma (,) Backslash (\) Forward Slash (/).

          It must not:

          + Be a name (your own, family members, pets, or famous people).
          + Be your social security number, driver's license number,
            passport number, or some other identification number.
          + Have repeating numbers, letters, or characters (111111,
            aaaaaa, !!!!!!).
          + Be a number or character combination that is next to each
            other on the keyboard (123456, asdfgh).
          + Be a dictionary word of any language.
          + Begin with an exclamation point (!) or question mark (?).
          + Have the same first three characters.

Step 1: Make a bootable micro SD card

   You must boot your Intel® Galileo board using a micro SD card that
   contains the latest Intel® IoT Developer Kit version of the
   Yocto*-built Linux image.

   Linux is the operating system that powers the Intel® Galileo board.
   While there is already a version of Linux built into your board, the
   developer-kit version of Yocto-built Linux includes even more libraries
   and resources to help developers create applications in their favorite
   programming language. This version includes GCC, Python, Node.js,
   OpenCV, to name a few.

   In addition, sketches that you upload to the Intel® Galileo board are
   erased when the board is powered down. To be able to resume the sketch
   even after powering down your board, you must boot from a micro SD
   card.

Requirements

   You must have a few things to begin. The steps below are for creating a
   micro SD card with a Windows* host system. There are separate
   instructions for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.

Method 1: Run the integrated installer

   Download and run the latest version of the Intel® Galileo Windows
   64-bit Arduino* Installer from the Intel® Galileo Board Downloads page.

   The integrated installer will install the Arduino IDE, as well as
   download the needed Win32 Disk Imager software to write to your SD
   card. It will not write to the SD card for you, but it will install the
   imaging software and leave it for you to finish the process. If you get
   stuck, refer to Method 2 below.

   End-user license

   Third-party program use

Method 2: Manual Process

   This section contains steps to download and extract the latest
   developer kit version of the Linux image.
    1. Download and install the 7-Zip file archiver from 7-Zip.org.
    2. Download the latest Intel® Galileo Board micro SD Card Linux*
       Operating System Image from the Intel® Galileo Board Downloads
       page.
    3. Use 7-Zip to extract the .bz2 file to your system. You must use
       7-Zip to extract the image, as it supports the extended file paths
       found in the compressed image file.
       You should now have a file called
       iot-devkit-version-mmcblkp0.direct alongside the original .bz2
       file, where version is either latest or a date in the YYYYMMDDHHMM
       format.

Write the image to your micro SD card

   This section contains steps to write the image to your micro SD card.
    1. Visit http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager and click the
       Download button to save the latest
       Win32DiskImager-version-binary.zip file to your system.
    2. Insert the micro SD card into your card reader.
    3. Run Win32 Disk Imager as an Administrator, as follows:
         1. Double-click Win32DiskImager-binary.zip to expand its
            contents.
         2. Open the Win32DiskImager-binary folder.
         3. Right-click Win32DiskImager.exe, then select Run as
            administrator.
    4. In Win32 Disk Imager, click the folder icon on the top right.
       Click the folder icon to browse for the Yocto image.
    5. In the file type drop-down list, select *.* so you can see all
       files, regardless of file extension.
       Select *.* to see all files, regardless of extension.
    6. Navigate to and select the .direct file that you extracted earlier,
       then click Open.
    7. From the Device drop-down list, select the device drive of your
       micro SD card.
       Caution: Be sure to select the correct device drive, as the drive
       letter for your card may be different on your system. Selecting the
       wrong drive letter could result in erasing your data on the wrong
       drive.
       Select the drive letter for your SD card.
    8. Click Write, then wait for the write process to finish. Please be
       patient, as this may take up to 5 minutes.
    9. After completing the write process, click Exit to close Win32 Disk
       Imager. Once the write process is complete, your bootable micro SD
       card should contain the following:
          + boot
          + firmware
          + win-driver
          + bzImage
   10. Eject and remove the micro SD card from your card reader.
   11. You can now insert the card into the micro SD card slot on your
       Intel Galileo board. When you power up your board, the board
       automatically boots using the image on the card.


   Now that you have created your bootable card, continue to assemble and
   power your board. If you want to get going quickly in Arduino, skip to
   installing the Arduino IDE.
