Grow Your Brand With Every Click

Branded links can drive a 34% higher click-through versus non-branded links,
meaning they help get more eyeballs on your brand and its content.


   branded links

Inspire trust

   As your click numbers go up, your brand recognition increases. And the
   more that grows, the more confident people become in the integrity of
   your content and communications. (It’s a wonderful cycle.)


   campaign analytics

Boost results

   Better deliverability and improved click-through are just the start.
   Rich link-level data allows you to understand who is clicking your
   links, as well as when and where, so you can make smarter decisions
   around the content and communications you share.


auto branding

Gain control

   On top of being able to fully customize your links, auto-branding
   boosts awareness of your brand by giving you credit for your content
   and more insight into how it’s being consumed.
