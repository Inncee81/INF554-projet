Project Debater: An AI system that can debate humans on complex topics

   Project Debater digests massive texts, constructs a well-structured
   speech on a given topic, delivers it with clarity and purpose, and
   rebuts its opponent. Eventually, Project Debater will help people
   reason by providing compelling, evidence-based arguments and limiting
   the influence of emotion, bias, or ambiguity.
