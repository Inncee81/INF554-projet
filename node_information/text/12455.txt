Camp Nou during a Clásico against Real Madrid



First Team

   League and Copa del Rey
   Written press, photo agencies and radio stations who are not
   broadcasting the game or connecting live to the game must send a
   corporate e-mail from their media outlet addressed to
   premsa@fcbarcelona.cat ten working days before the day of the game,
   with the exception of the Barça-Real Madrid fixture which must arrive
   30 days before the game. The request must come from a director, sports
   editor or another editor. Under no circumstances will requests be
   accepted from e-mail accounts such as Hotmail, Gmail etc.

   Non-rights holding Spanish TV stations and radio stations broadcasting
   the game must request accreditation from the league at
   acreditaciones@laliga.es and international TV companies must apply to
   Mediapro at acreditaciones@mediapro.es.

   Champions League
   The media, with the exception of rights holding TV companies, must send
   a corporate e-mail from their media outlet addressed to
   premsa@fcbarcelona.cat ten working days before the day of the game. The
   request must come from a director, sports editor or another editor.
   Under no circumstances will requests be accepted from e-mail accounts
   such as Hotmail, Gmail etc.

   Comments
   The time it takes to process the request can vary according to the
   level of demand in each of the different press areas: press box,
   pitchside, press room and Mixed Zone.

   Requests received after the deadline will not be considered and we
   advise contacting the Communications Department to confirm that the
   request has been received and processed.

   Sending a request does not guarantee accreditation for the first team’s
   matches at Camp Nou.
