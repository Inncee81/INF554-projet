   What are cookies in computers?

   Also known as browser cookies or tracking cookies, cookies are small,
   often encrypted text files, located in browser directories. They are
   used by web developers to help users navigate their websites
   efficiently and perform certain functions. Due to their core role of
   enhancing/enabling usability or site processes, disabling cookies may
   prevent users from using certain websites.

   Cookies are created when a user's browser loads a particular website.
   The website sends information to the browser which then creates a text
   file. Every time the user goes back to the same website, the browser
   retrieves and sends this file to the website's server. Computer Cookies
   are created not just by the website the user is browsing but also by
   other websites that run ads, widgets, or other elements on the page
   being loaded. These cookies regulate how the ads appear or how the
   widgets and other elements function on the page.For Managing cookies
   for different browsers see here
   [INS: :INS]

   Standard uses for browser cookies

   Website servers set cookies to help authenticate the user if the user
   logs in to a secure area of the website. Login information is stored in
   a cookie so the user can enter and leave the website without having to
   re-enter the same authentication information over and over. More
   information

   Session Cookies are also used by the server to store information about
   user page activities so users can easily pick up where they left off on
   the server's pages. By default, web pages really don't have any
   'memory'. Cookies tell the server what pages to show the user so the
   user doesn't have to remember or start navigating the site all over
   again. Cookies act as a sort of “bookmark” within the site. Similarly,
   cookies can store ordering information needed to make shopping carts
   work instead of forcing the user to remember all the items the user put
   in the shopping cart.

   Persistent or tracking Cookies are also employed to store user
   preferences. Many websites allow the user to customize how information
   is presented through site layouts or themes. These changes make the
   site easier to navigate and/or lets user leave a part of the user's
   “personality” at the site. For Information on session and persistent
   and tracking cookies, see here

   Cookie security and privacy issues

   Cookies are NOT viruses. Cookies use a plain text format. They are not
   compiled pieces of code so they cannot be executed nor are they
   self-executing. Accordingly, they cannot make copies of themselves and
   spread to other networks to execute and replicate again. Since they
   cannot perform these functions, they fall outside the standard virus
   definition.

   Cookies CAN be used for malicious purposes though. Since they store
   information about a user's browsing preferences and history, both on a
   specific site and browsing among several sites, cookies can be used to
   act as a form of spyware. Many anti-spyware products are well aware of
   this problem and routinely flag cookies as candidates for deletion
   after standard virus and/or spyware scans.See here for some privacy
   issues and concerns.

   The way responsible and ethical web developers deal with privacy issues
   caused by cookie tracking is by including clear descriptions of how
   cookies are deployed on their site. If you are a web developer and need
   advice on implementation of cookies and a privacy policy, you can
   contact us by the enquiry form at the bottom of the page. These privacy
   policies should explain what kind of information is collected and how
   the information is used. Organizations utilising and displaying a
   proper and useful cookie's policy and privacy policy include: LinkedIn
   Networkadvertising.org and Dealspotr

   Most browsers have built in privacy settings that provide differing
   levels of cookie acceptance, expiration time, and disposal after a user
   has visited a particular site. Backing up your computer can give you
   the peace of mind that your files are safe.

   Other cookie-based threats

   Since identity protection is highly valued and is every internet users
   right , it pays to be aware of what threat cookies can pose.

   As cookies are transmitted back and forth between a browser and
   website, if an attacker or unauthorized person gets in between the data
   transmission, the sensitive cookie information can be intercepted.
   Although relatively rare, this can happen if the browser is connecting
   to the server using an unencrypted network like an non-secured WiFi
   channel.Internet security is only attainable if you regualrly use a
   anti-virus protection programme.See our anti virus protection section.

   Other cookie-based attacks involve exploiting faulty cookie-setting
   systems on servers. If a website doesn't require browsers to use
   encrypted channels only, attackers can use this vulnerability to trick
   browsers into sending sensitive information over insecure channels. The
   attackers then siphon off the sensitive data for unauthorized access
   purposes.

   New Laws for the use of cookies and other technologies that store
   online user information.

   On May 26th 2011, new rules governing the use of cookies by websites
   comes into force in Europe.

   Rather than the "Opt out" option for website visitors, websites will
   need to specifically gain the consent of their visitor and they must
   "Opt In" to be able to store cookies on their computer or other
   devices.This is expected to be difficult to manage and enforcement will
   more than likely be done subtlely and with encouragement rather than
   with the threat of fines and penalties.

   Businesses in the EU have some great resources that can help them with
   their cookie compliance. The European Union has a internet
   handbook that explains to businesses their requirements under the
   legislation and has a 'cookie kit" to help them comply.

What does the new law say?

   The new requirement is essentially that cookies can only be placed on
   machines where the user or subscriber has given their consent.
   6 (1) Subject to paragraph (4), a person shall not store or gain access
   to information stored, in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or
   user unless the requirements of paragraph (2) are met.
   (2) The requirements are that the subscriber or user of that terminal
   equipment--
   (a) is provided with clear and comprehensive information about the
   purposes of the storage of, or access to, that information; and
   (b) has given his or her consent.
   (3) Where an electronic communications network is used by the same
   person to store or access information in the terminal equipment of a
   subscriber or user on more than one occasion, it is sufficient for the
   purposes of this regulation that the requirements of paragraph (2) are
   met in respect of the initial use.
   “(3A) For the purposes of paragraph (2), consent may be signified by a
   subscriber who amends or sets controls on the internet browser which
   the subscriber uses or by using another application or programme to
   signify consent.
   (4) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to the technical storage of, or
   access to, information--
   (a) for the sole purpose of carrying out the transmission of a
   communication over an electronic communications network; or
   (b) where such storage or access is strictly necessary for the
   provision of an information society service requested by the subscriber
   or user.

   More information on the new changes can be found here.

Key tips for safe and responsible cookie-based Web browsing

   Due to their flexibility and the fact that many of the largest and
   most-visited websites use cookies by default, cookies are almost
   unavoidable. Disabling cookies will lock a user out of many of the most
   widely-used sites on the Internet like Youtube, Gmail, Yahoo mail, and
   others. Even search settings require cookies for language settings.
   Here are some tips you can use to ensure worry-free cookie-based
   browsing:

   Customize your browser's cookie settings to reflect your comfort level
   with cookie security or use our guide to delete cookies.

   If you are very comfortable with cookies and you are the only person
   using your computer, you may want to set long expiration time frames
   for storing your personal access information and browsing history.

   If you share access on your computer, you may want to set your browser
   to clear private browsing data every time you close your browser. While
   not as secure as rejecting cookies outright, this option lets you
   access cookie-based websites while deleting any sensitive information
   after your browsing session.

   Install and keep antispyware applications updated

   Many spyware detection, cleanup applications, and spyware removers
   include attack site detection. They block your browser from accessing
   websites designed to exploit browser vulnerabilities or download
   malicious software.

   Make sure your browser is updated

   If you haven't already, set your browser to update automatically. This
   eliminates security vulnerabilities caused by outdated browsers. Many
   cookie-based exploits are based on exploiting older browsers' security
   shortcomings.

   Cookies are everywhere and can't really be avoided if you wish to enjoy
   the biggest and best websites out there. With a clear understanding of
   how they operate and how they help your browsing experience, you can
   take the necessary security measures to ensure that you browse the Net
   confidently.
