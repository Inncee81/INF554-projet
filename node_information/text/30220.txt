   As CMO of one of the largest software companies in the world, SAP’s
   Alicia Tillman believes that quality of experience is at the center of
   today’s economy. Even in the B2B sector, Tillman focuses her efforts on
   telling a consumer-centric story, not only marketing to the
   stakeholders in charge of purchasing technology, but also the employees
   who use it. She finds that her marketing team does this best when data
   is successfully interpreted and used to shape a narrative that
   resonates with consumers of technology within the business.

   As part of our upcoming report on the future of the CMO, we spoke with
   Tillman about the modern marketing team, reaching millennial consumers
   B2B realm and the challenges of being a CMO.

   What are the most critical components of a modern marketing team?

   I would say two things. First, you need to have the ability to provide
   intelligence and data. Over the past decade, marketers have worked
   hard, as every function has in a company, to get access to data ... and
   derive intelligence from the data. What are we learning from it? How
   does it enable us to better shape an experience for a customer? I'm not
   saying everybody is going to be a data scientist, but ... there needs
   to be a function within any marketing organization where you have
   people who understand data enough to truly understand the intelligence
   that it's bringing to you.

   The second is you need to be able to shape that intelligence into a
   story. You need storytellers. You need not only people who are very
   business-savvy, but also have a beautiful way of being able to tell a
   story about your brand that speaks to the value connected to being able
   to deliver it in a way that is relevant, connected and emotional.

   As CMO, what is top of mind for you at SAP, and where do you see it
   going and driving the business?

   We live in a very experience-driven economy. Business is won or lost
   based on the quality of the experience that your company, product,
   brand and employees are delivering. It's top of mind for every CMO in
   any company, regardless of the industry that you're in, be it consumer
   or B2B.

   So when I think about the role of the marketer, in particular, we have
   a tremendous opportunity to really help get closer to the customer, to
   truly understand, not just their feedback, but also their needs, and
   that should be able to shape our operation as a result of it.

   How does a CMO push forward to deliver and work through challenges?

   The pressures are real. I've been in the corporate environment now for
   over 10 years, and I've had the privilege of working with fantastic
   corporations throughout my career. But all of them are focused on the
   cost of growing the business. You're challenged, often, on headcount
   and programs, yet wanting to give more to this project or that project.
   Whether you're growing rapidly or not, that's always going to be the
   reality you're faced with.

   For me, it’s about understanding what matters to your stakeholders and
   what's commanding results in the marketplace, and this is where you
   make some really tough decisions because everybody on your team feels
   that they're working on the most important project.

   How has your brand story and audience transformed?

   We need to take a hard look at the story that we are positioning in the
   marketplace, about the value of our brand. I was talking with a group
   of employees, and they were asking me about the 47-year-old brand.
   What's the story we need today vs. how you shared the story then?

   Millennials have grown up with technology and, in a lot of ways,
   they're making choices based on the quality of the technology that they
   use day to day to perform their job. Therefore, you're no longer
   messaging to one person, nor are you messaging about features and
   functionality, but you're messaging to a broader group with lots of
   differences.

   How does this change the way you operate as a marketer?

   The dynamic has changed so much that it's cause for our story to need
   to be differentiated to talk about value and purpose, and be authentic
   because people want authenticity, and they want to buy from brands that
   stand for something, have a voice and take a stand on issues.
   Regardless of me being a B2B or not, it has to be much more of a
   consumer-based story because of the broad group that we now need to
   speak with and because, regardless of the industry sector that you're
   in, people buy based on the quality of the experience and how much that
   resonates and speaks to what they're after.

   October.

   Chipotle CMO Chris Brandt on Telling the Company's Story as It Makes
   Its Comeback

   After several years of food safety challenges, Chipotle Mexican Grill
   had to rebuild its brand. Part of those efforts included bringing on
   Chris Brandt as CMO last year, who helped the company embrace digital
   as part of its efforts to reach Gen Z and millennials.

   For our upcoming report on the future of the CMO, we spoke to Brandt
   about making Chipotle more visible and relevant to its customers
   through telling stories about the company's fresh-food values.

   Below is an excerpted conversation with Brandt, who will be speaking in
   October at the ANA Masters of Marketing Week conference in Florida.

   What are some of your priorities right now?

   When I came into Chipotle, our original purpose was to make the brand
   more visible, familiar and relevant. We wanted to keep the disrupted
   nature of the brand and celebrate what makes Chipotle special because
   the brand had spent a lot of time over the last few years being
   invisible. And where it was visible, it was focused against what others
   don't do as opposed to celebrating what makes Chipotle great. When I
   came in, I wanted to change that tone. People have enough negativity,
   and we wanted to be much more positive.

   What does "changing the tone" look like?

   I've always told my teams that our marketing job is threefold: We want
   to be innovators, storytellers and collaborators.

   We've got to have a bunch of ideas, a good stage gate process to vet
   those ideas and move efficiently. We've got to put a lot of irons in
   the fire because you just don't know what's going to be the big idea
   unless you actually get it out there and test.

   And then you have to find the stories of the brand and tell them
   because today's consumer— particularly at Chipotle where almost half of
   our consumers are Gen Zers or millennials—want to know the story behind
   the brand. That's something you didn't have to do much before. People
   not only want a conversation, they expect you to have one and
   understand what the brand stands for.

   How is Chipotle telling that story?

   We use real, unprocessed ingredients that are responsibly sourced using
   classic cooking techniques to make really clean, delicious food—no
   microwaves, can openers or freezers. Those are fundamental things
   people didn't know.

   The big moment for me happened just a few weeks in to the job. We were
   doing in-store training to get a behind-the-scenes look at what really
   happens. I went to a store opening around 7:30am, and Chipotle looked
   more like a farmer's market than any other restaurant I had ever seen:
   There were crates of peppers, bags of onions and boxes of avocados
   coming in. The team in the back was cutting and dicing
   ingredients—using real culinary skills to make all these raw
   ingredients into what we’d put on the line that day. I thought, "If we
   could show this to everybody, people would love it."

   So I spoke with our agency, Venables up in San Francisco, about how we
   capture that. And that gave rise to our new ad campaign “Behind the
   Foil,” where we use employees to talk about what makes Chipotle great
   and what they value most about it."

   What makes the CMO role challenging today?

   The CMO has to be the most balanced left brain/right brain person in
   the organization. You have to be able to understand creative and
   messaging in an artful way, but you also have to be really analytical
   about what's truly driving the business, challenging the analytics,
   being on top of all the numbers. That is a rare person.

   You [also] need to have a sense of, “Well, I want to try new things and
   come up with ideas, but at the same time, be practical.”

   It’s the art and science combination that makes that CMO job harder
   than it's ever been, but it should be more valuable than it's ever been
   because that's where growth can come for the organization. It's where
   you can rally the organization around a cause or a purpose. If you
   can't bring them to life in pictures, sound and storytelling, who else
   is going to do that?

   What are some constraints that you’re working under as you try to reach
   these growth or revenue goals?

   Budgets aren't growing, there's so much pressure on the bottom line,
   quarter by quarter. You have to deliver sales today and the brand
   tomorrow. And in a retail business, you've got to be about 80% in
   building sales today, or you won't be there tomorrow. We call it,
   “Winning today and cultivating the future.” But when I came into this
   business, we weren't winning in the daily, so we had to make sure that
   we were driving transactions and bringing more people in to the
   restaurants.

   Now, we've been lucky that we've been able to build the brand [because]
   some investments you make are much more brand-oriented over time. Those
   are the ones that are harder to justify on the ROI sheet, but they're
   just as important to making sure that you can grow tomorrow the way you
   grow today, especially given consumers' desires to understand your
   brand values.

   Make sure to read our report, publishing in October.

   Netflix Struggles to Gain a Foothold in India; YouTube Dominates

   India
   (BUTTON)

   For our new collection of reports on video trends across the world, we
   published new India forecasts for digital video viewers, subscription
   over-the-top (OTT) users, Netflix viewers and YouTube viewers.

   Overall, our figures show that the number of digital video viewers in
   India continues to grow as cheap data plans flood the market of 1.3
   billion people. We estimate that there will be 290.8 million digital
   video viewers in 2019, an increase of 18.6% from the previous year. By
   2021, we expect that number to reach 368.8 million viewers.
   [svg%3E%0A] [8090_original_lazy]

   Below are our breakdowns for Netflix and YouTube viewers.

Netflix

   Netflix has had difficulty gaining share of the Indian subscription
   video-on-demand (SVOD) market because of its relatively high prices and
   low amount of local-language content. Our latest estimates show that
   since entering the market in 2016, Netflix will have 8.1 million
   viewers in India this year, which will increase to 10.2 million by
   2020. Netflix viewership in India makes up less than 5% of all digital
   video viewers in the country.
   [svg%3E%0A] [8091_original_lazy]

   Netlflix’s challenge in India can be attributed to much higher prices
   for its services than that of local competitors. Its monthly
   subscriptions start at 500 INR ($7.31) and users are not allowed to
   watch on more than one screen at a time. Hotstar, a massively popular
   streaming service with 70% of the market, offers a VIP plan at 365 INR
   ($5.34) a year, making the cost of an annual Netflix subscription more
   than 15 times as expensive.

   Netflix recognizes that its price is a major obstacle to gaining
   subscribers, which is why it announced at the end of July a 199 INR
   ($2.91) mobile-only plan that doesn’t offer HD viewing. Amazon Prime
   Video is another competitor in the market, and Netflix’s cheaper mobile
   plan is still more expensive than Prime Video's monthly 129 INR ($1.85)
   rate. Prime Video also offers much more local-language content.

YouTube

   YouTube has inundated the Indian market, in part because it's free and
   ad-supported, and because it has become a regular part of people’s
   everyday lives. We estimate that this year, there will be 271.9 million
   YouTube viewers in India, which makes up a hefty 93.5% of digital video
   viewers in the country. By next year, that number will grow by 13.5% to
   308.7 million. Growth will slow down by 2021 (10.9%), with 342.3
   million viewers.
   [svg%3E%0A] []

   YouTube has experienced rapid growth in local-language content
   creation. Satya Raghavan, director of content partnerships at YouTube
   India, said that 60% of viewership in the country comes from outside
   the country’s major cities, with 95% of it in Indian languages.

   For more figures on video viewership in India, make sure to read our
   global video report collection publishing in September.

   How Publishers Are Responding to Ad Blocking

   Ad Blocking
   United States
   (BUTTON)

   Ad blocking and avoidance have their most immediate effects on
   publishers that miss out on ad revenues they would otherwise have
   received from serving content to ad blocking users. Ad avoidance is
   just one of the reasons the average non-walled-garden publisher is
   struggling with ad-based monetization, and alternative revenue
   strategies have been gaining importance in recent years.

   For our latest report, "Consumer Attitudes on Marketing 2019," we
   examined how publishers are being affected by continued growth.

   Display ads are still the most important digital revenue stream for
   news publishers worldwide this year, according to polling by the
   Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at the University of
   Oxford. But subscriptions were a close second. Almost half of
   respondents indicated events were an importance source of revenues, and
   31% pointed to ecommerce.

   None of these revenue streams are new, and previous editions of this
   report have noted publisher work on all of them. Big-name publisher
   brands like The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street
   Journal now boast significant subscription revenue streams.
   Ecommerce-related revenues could include a variety of tactics—such as
   affiliate links, which publishers are finding some success with,
   according to reporting in outlets such as Digiday, Nieman Lab and
   Forbes.

   Some publishers are also looking to become ad networks or technology
   vendors of their own, including Vox Media with its Chorus and Concert
   products and The Washington Post with its publishing platform Arc.

   “There’s going to be a lot of different branching out in terms of
   looking into other revenue streams,” said Zack Dugow, founder and CEO
   at publisher monetization partner Insticator. “Certainly the tier one
   publishers with really strong brands will be able to do that
   successfully, for example by creating more of an events business, or
   creating more of a subscription business.

   “But it's really difficult for smaller publishers or mid-tier
   publishers to get people to subscribe to their content and have that
   become useful revenue for them,” he said.

   Subscriptions aren’t a complete solution on the consumer side, either.
   We have followed the issue of subscription fatigue and whether there’s
   a limit to the number of different sources of content people will pay
   for. Many publishers, including video platform Dailymotion, recognize
   there will be major consumer demand for free, ad-supported services as
   well as experiences with no or fewer ads.

   “You're going to start to see higher-quality publishers offer free
   streaming and accessible content, and make it ad-supported,” said
   Claudia Page, senior vice president of product and partner development
   at Dailymotion. “Especially if the ads and the ad formats are
   contextually relevant to the content, un-intrusive, and you're not
   serving three or two in-stream ads just for a 45-minute clip. You're
   going to start seeing a lot more from quality publishers trying to
   diversify the way that they not only reach an audience, but then
   monetize it.”

   “Consumers will accept advertising if it fits their interest and it's
   good,” said Todd Loofbourrow, CEO and chairman of video ad tech
   provider ViralGains. “The consumption of video advertising is at an
   all-time high despite ad blocking and skip buttons. If the ads are good
   and they fit what someone's interested in, there is appetite for free
   services supported by ads. In fact, the appetite is much larger for
   that kind of service than it is for premium ones.”

   So there’s still important work publishers, advertisers and their
   partners must do to ensure the advertising experience is good,
   involving better creative and formats and different ways of targeting
   and creating relevance. And new infrastructures may be needed to
   accomplish that.
