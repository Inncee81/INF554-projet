   Carlos Nobre

   In the 1970s, Brazilian scientist Eneas Salati shattered the long held
   dogma that vegetation is simply the consequence of climate and has no
   influence on climate whatsoever (1). Using isotopic ratios of oxygen in
   rainwater samples collected from the Atlantic to the Peruvian border,
   he was able to demonstrate unequivocally that the Amazon generates
   approximately half of its own rainfall by recycling moisture 5 to 6
   times as airmasses move from the Atlantic across the basin to the west.

   From the start, the demonstration of the hydrological cycle of the
   Amazon raised the question of how much deforestation would be required
   to cause the cycle to degrade to the point of being unable to support
   rain forest ecosystems.

   High levels of evaporation and transpiration that forests produce
   throughout the year contribute to a wetter atmospheric boundary layer
   than would be the case with non-forest.This surface-atmosphere coupling
   is more important where large-scale factors for rainfall formation are
   weaker, such as in central and eastern Amazonia. Near the Andes, the
   impact of at least modest deforestation is less dramatic because the
   general ascending motion of airmasses in this area induces high levels
   of rainfall in addition to that expected from local evaporation and
   transpiration.

   Where might the tipping point be for deforestation-generated
   degradation of the hydrological cycle? The very first model to examine
   this question (2) showed that at about 40% deforestation, central,
   southern and eastern Amazonia would experience diminished rainfall and
   a lengthier dry season, predicting a shift to savanna vegetation to the
   east.

   Moisture from the Amazon is important to rainfall and human wellbeing
   because it contributes to winter rainfall for parts of the La Plata
   basin, especially southern Paraguay, southern Brazil, Uruguay and
   central-eastern Argentina; in other regions, the moisture passes over
   the area, but does not precipitate out. Although the amount
   contributing to rainfall in southeastern Brazil is smaller than in
   other areas, even small amounts can be a welcome addition to urban
   reservoirs.

   The importance of Amazon moisture for Brazilian agriculture south of
   the Amazon is complex but not trivial. Perhaps most important is the
   partial contribution of dry season Amazon evapotranspiration to
   rainfall in southeastern South America. Forests maintain an
   evapotranspiration rate year-round, whereas evapotranspiration in
   pastures is dramatically lower in the dry season. As a consequence,
   models suggest a longer dry season after deforestation.

   In recent decades, new forcing factors have impinged on the
   hydrological cycle: climate change and widespread use of fire to
   eliminate felled trees and clear weedy vegetation. Many studies show
   that in the absence of other contributing factors, 4° Celsius of global
   warming would be the tipping point to degraded savannas in most of the
   central, southern, and eastern Amazon. Widespread use of fire leads to
   drying of surrounding forest and greater vulnerability to fire in the
   subsequent year.

   We believe that negative synergies between deforestation, climate
   change, and widespread use of fire indicate a tipping point for the
   Amazon system to flip to non-forest ecosystems in eastern, southern and
   central Amazonia at 20-25% deforestation.

   The severity of the droughts of 2005, 2010 and 2015-16 could well
   represent the first flickers of this ecological tipping point. These
   events, together with the severe floods of 2009, 2012 (and 2014 over SW
   Amazonia), suggest that the whole system is oscillating. For the last
   two decades the dry season over the southern and eastern Amazon has
   been increasing. Large scale factors such as warmer sea surface
   temperatures over the tropical North Atlantic also seem to be
   associated with the changes on land.

   We believe that the sensible course is not only to strictly curb
   further deforestation, but also to build back a margin of safety
   against the Amazon tipping point, by reducing the deforested area to
   less than 20%, for the commonsense reason that there is no point in
   discovering the precise tipping point by tipping it. At the 2015 Paris
   Conference of the Parties, Brazil committed to 12 million ha of
   reforestation by 2030. Much or most of this reforestation should be in
   southern and eastern Amazonia. The hydrological cycle of the Amazon is
   fundamental to human well-being in Brazil and adjacent South America.

Abstract

   Limiting climate warming to <2°C requires increased mitigation efforts,
   including land stewardship, whose potential in the United States is
   poorly understood. We quantified the potential of natural climate
   solutions (NCS)—21 conservation, restoration, and improved land
   management interventions on natural and agricultural lands—to increase
   carbon storage and avoid greenhouse gas emissions in the United States.
   We found a maximum potential of 1.2 (0.9 to 1.6) Pg CO[2]e year^−1, the
   equivalent of 21% of current net annual emissions of the United States.
   At current carbon market prices (USD 10 per Mg CO[2]e), 299 Tg CO[2]e
   year^−1 could be achieved. NCS would also provide air and water
   filtration, flood control, soil health, wildlife habitat, and climate
   resilience benefits.

INTRODUCTION

   Limiting global warming below the 2°C threshold set by the Paris
   Climate Agreement is contingent upon both reducing emissions and
   removing greenhouse gases (GHGs) from the atmosphere (1, 2). Natural
   climate solutions (NCS), a portfolio of discrete land stewardship
   options (3), are the most mature approaches available for carbon
   conservation and uptake compared to nascent carbon capture technologies
   (4) and could complement increases in zero-carbon energy production and
   energy efficiency to achieve needed climate change mitigation. Within
   the United States, the maximum and economically viable mitigation
   potentials from NCS are unclear.

   Here, we quantify the maximum potential for NCS in the United States
   and the portion of this maximum that could be achieved at several price
   points. We consider 21 distinct NCS to provide a consistent and
   comprehensive exploration of the mitigation potential of conservation,
   restoration, and improved management in forests, grasslands,
   agricultural lands, and wetlands (Fig. 1), carefully defined to avoid
   double counting (details in the Supplementary Materials). We estimate
   the potential for NCS in the year 2025, which is the target year for
   the United States’ Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) under the
   Paris Agreement to reduce GHG emissions by 26 to 28% from 2005 levels.
   Our work refines a coarser-resolution global analysis (3) and updates
   and expands the range of options considered in previous analyses for
   the United States (5–8).

   Fig. 1 Climate mitigation potential of 21 NCS in the United States.

   Black lines indicate the 95% CI or reported range (see table S1).
   Ecosystem service benefits linked with each NCS are indicated by
   colored bars for air (filtration), biodiversity (habitat protection or
   restoration), soil (enrichment), and water (filtration and flood
   control). See the Supplementary Materials for detailed findings and
   sources.

   For each NCS opportunity (Fig. 1 and the Supplementary Materials), we
   estimate the maximum mitigation potential of GHGs measured in CO[2]
   equivalents (CO[2]e), given the below constraints. We then estimate the
   reductions obtainable for less than USD 10, 50, and 100 per Mg CO[2]e.
   Current carbon markets pay around USD 10 (9). The social cost of carbon
   in 2025 is approximately USD 50, using a 3% discount rate (10).
   However, a price of at least USD 100 is thought to be needed to keep
   the 100-year average temperature from warming more than 2.5°C (11), and
   an even higher price may be needed to meet the Paris Agreement <2°C
   target. Many NCS also generate co-benefits, which, even without a price
   on carbon, provide incentives to invest in NCS implementation. We
   identified co-benefits generated by each NCS in four categories of
   ecosystem services: air, biodiversity, water, and soil (Fig. 1 and
   table S2).

   To avoid conflicts with other important societal goals for land use, we
   constrain our maximum estimate to be compatible with human needs for
   food and fiber (Supplementary Materials). Within these constraints, 5.1
   Mha of cropland can be restored to grasslands, forests, and wetlands,
   equal to the area that has left the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP)
   since 2007 (8) and less than half the land currently dedicated to corn
   ethanol. We also estimate that 1.3 Mha of pasture could be reforested
   without affecting livestock production, assuming recent improvements in
   efficiency continue (see the Supplementary Materials). We assume that
   timber production can temporarily decrease by 10%, which maintains
   timber production levels within the historic range of variation and
   enables managed forests and plantations to transition to longer harvest
   rotations (see the Supplementary Materials). We assume that extensive
   natural forests on private lands can all undergo harvest extension,
   with the temporary loss of timber supply replaced by reforestation and
   thinning for fire risk reduction (12) or with thinning or select
   harvest practices that still provide timber but maintain carbon levels
   (Supplementary Materials) (13, 14). We further constrain our analysis
   to avoid impacts on biodiversity. This biodiversity constraint
   precludes both the conversion of natural habitat to energy crops and
   the afforestation of native grasslands.

RESULTS

   We find a maximum additional NCS mitigation potential of 1.2 Pg CO[2]e
   year^−1 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.9 to 1.6 Pg CO[2]e year^−1] in
   the year 2025 (Fig. 1 and table S1). This is 21% of the 5794.5 Tg
   CO[2]e of net emissions in 2016 (15). The majority (63%) of this
   potential comes from increased carbon sequestration in plant biomass,
   with 29% coming from increased carbon sequestration in soil and 7%
   coming from avoided emissions of CH[4] and N[2]O. At the USD 10, 50,
   and 100 price points, 25, 76, and 91%, respectively, of the maximum
   mitigation would be achieved. This means that 1.1 Pg CO[2]e year^−1 are
   available at USD 100 per Mg CO[2]e, which equals the emission
   reductions needed to meet the U.S. NDC under the Paris Agreement (see
   the Supplementary Materials). If NCS were pursued in combination with
   additional mitigation in the energy sector, then it would therefore
   enable the United States to exceed its current NDC ambition. This is
   important because, globally, current NDCs (7 to 9 Pg CO[2]e year^−1)
   would need to be dramatically increased (by an additional 10 to 16 Pg
   CO[2]e year^−1) to limit warming below 2°C (16).

   This estimate of maximum NCS potential is similar to or higher than
   several previous syntheses of mitigation opportunities in the land
   sector. For example, the United States Mid-Century Strategy for Deep
   Decarbonization estimated a potential land sink of 912 Tg CO[2]e
   year^−1, 30% lower than our estimate (5). While other efforts have
   focused on the forest sector (7) or the agricultural sector (6), this
   analysis presents a comprehensive and up-to-date synthesis of NCS
   opportunities in the United States. For example, this analysis
   considers potential additional mitigation from tidal wetlands and
   seagrass (“blue carbon”), which has been comprehensively analyzed for
   its current status in the United States (17), but not its potential for
   additional mitigation.

   Reforestation has the single largest maximum mitigation potential (307
   Tg CO[2]e year^−1). The majority of this potential occurs in the
   northeast (35%) and south central (31%) areas of the United States
   (fig. S1). This mitigation potential increases to 381 Tg CO[2]e year^−1
   if all pastures in historically forested areas are reforested. Previous
   estimates of reforestation potential range widely from 208 to 1290 Tg
   CO[2]e year^−1 (7). Higher estimates than ours can be obtained by
   reforesting or afforesting areas that we excluded (e.g., productive
   crop and pasture lands and natural grasslands) and/or by using rates of
   carbon sequestration from plantation systems rather than from natural
   regenerating forests [e.g., (7)].

   Natural forest management of privately held forests has the second
   largest maximum mitigation potential (267 Tg CO[2]e year^−1). This
   maximum mitigation is achieved by extending harvest cycles. Mitigation
   can also be achieved through forest management practices such as
   reduced impact logging and improved silvicultural practices that
   release suppressed forest growth (18–20), although often at lower
   sequestration rates than extending harvest cycles. These management
   practices can be implemented at low or no net cost (21, 22) and do not
   require a change in business-as-usual (BAU) land use or ownership
   rights.

   Another promising opportunity associated with forests is fire
   management (18 Tg CO[2]e year^−1; fig. S6). Fire management entails
   restoring frequent, low-intensity, understory fires in fire-prone
   forest ecosystems to reduce the potential for high-severity wildfires
   (23). The primary carbon benefit from fire management is avoiding
   decreased net ecosystem production from tree-killing wildfire. In the
   absence of improved fire management, climate change is expected to
   continue to increase the frequency of high-severity fires and
   compromise the ability of forests to regenerate following these fires
   (24). The high uncertainty associated with the climate mitigation
   benefits of fire management would be reduced by additional research to
   quantify the carbon storage benefits of prescribed fire across a
   diversity of forest types, including the length of time that prescribed
   fire reduces the risk of subsequent high-severity fires.

   Avoided conversion protects carbon stored in extant forests and
   grasslands from ongoing losses. More than two-thirds of the avoided
   forest conversion potential (38 Tg CO[2]e year^−1) occurs in the
   Southern and Pacific Northwest regions (table S14 and fig. S9). Many of
   the most intensive areas of rapid forest conversion were located near
   urban zones, with additional hot spots in recent agricultural expansion
   zones (such as California’s Central Valley) and semi-arid regions of
   the West. Avoided conversion of grassland to cropland prevents
   emissions from soils and root biomass (107 Tg CO[2]e year^−1; fig.
   S12). The emissions from grassland conversion exceed the emissions from
   forest conversion because both the rate of conversion and the per
   hectare emissions are higher (table S1). Cropland expansion is a major
   cause of conversion that affects grasslands much more than forests
   (25). The higher rate of emissions occurs because the conversion of
   grasslands to croplands results in a 28% loss of soil carbon from the
   top meter of soil (26). This generates 125 Mg CO[2]e ha^−1 in
   emissions, comprising 81% of the emissions from grassland conversion
   (see the Supplementary Materials). Because research shows conflicting
   conclusions regarding the impact of forest conversion in the United
   States on soil carbon, we do not include the soil carbon pool in our
   estimate of emissions from forest conversion (see the Supplementary
   Materials).

   Carbon sequestration opportunities in croplands include the use of
   cover crops and improved cropland nutrient management. Cover crops,
   grown when fields are normally bare, provide additional carbon inputs
   to soils. Growing cover crops on the 88 Mha of the five primary crops
   in United States not already using cover crops presents a substantial
   opportunity for mitigation (103 Tg CO[2]e year^−1). Cover crops are
   increasingly used by U.S. farmers to improve soil health, yields, and
   yield consistency (27). Improved management of nitrogen fertilizers
   reduces N[2]O emissions and avoids fossil fuel emissions associated
   with fertilizer production (52 Tg CO[2]e year^−1). Fertilizer rates can
   be reduced while maintaining yields by using precision agriculture to
   apply only the amount required in each part of the field and by
   splitting fertilizer applications to match the timing and supply of
   fertilizer with crop demand (see the Supplementary Materials).
   Emissions can also be reduced by switching from anhydrous fertilizer to
   urea, which has lower N[2]O emission (6).

   The agronomic practices of biochar incorporation (95 Tg CO[2]e year^−1)
   and alley cropping (planting widely spaced trees interspersed with a
   row crop; 82 Tg CO[2]e year^−1) also have high maximum potential.
   However, current adoption is negligible due to a variety of cultural,
   technological, and cost barriers that would need to be overcome if
   these practices were to achieve their mitigation potential (28, 29).

   Tidal wetland restoration is the largest wetland NCS (12 Tg CO[2]e
   year^−1). Roughly 27% of U.S. salt marshes are disconnected from the
   ocean and subject to freshwater inundation. This results in a large
   increase in CH[4] emissions from these “freshened” salt marshes.
   Reconnecting salt marshes with the ocean, such as via culverts under
   roads or other barriers, can avoid these CH[4] emissions (30).

   The 10 opportunities described above account for 90% (1082 Tg CO[2]e
   year^−1) of the maximum NCS mitigation potential across all 21
   opportunities. An additional 11 opportunities, which sum to 122 Tg
   CO[2]e year^−1, account for just 10% of the maximum potential. However,
   these NCS may offer optimal ecological and economic opportunities at
   local scales (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Materials). For example,
   peatland restoration offers a high per hectare mitigation benefit,
   especially in regions of the United States with warm temperate climates
   (8.2 Mg CO[2]e ha^−1 year^−1).

   Lower-cost opportunities represent particularly promising areas for
   increased near-term investment. We identified 299 Tg CO[2]e year^−1 of
   NCS opportunities that could be realized for USD 10 Mg CO[2]e^−1 or
   less (table S1), a price that is in line with many current carbon
   markets (9). The two largest lower-cost opportunities are improved
   management practices: cover crops (100 Tg CO[2]e year^−1) and improved
   natural forest management (64 Tg CO[2]e year^−1). Both of these
   practices, along with planting windbreaks (5 Tg CO[2]e year^−1) and
   legumes in pastures (3 Tg CO[2]e year^−1), have the potential to
   increase yields (21, 22, 27) and therefore to generate additional
   revenue for landowners. Improved manure management can also provide
   low-cost mitigation (12 Tg CO[2]e year^−1) (8). In addition, lower-cost
   NCS include increased efficiencies (cropland nutrient management, 28 Tg
   CO[2]e year^−1; grazing optimization, 6 Tg CO[2]e year^−1) and avoided
   conversion (avoided forest conversion, 37 Tg CO[2]e year^−1; avoided
   grassland conversion, 24 Tg CO[2]e year^−1).

   By itself, the marginal abatement cost gives an incomplete picture of
   the potential for implementation of NCS, in part because NCS provide a
   variety of co-benefits (Fig. 1 and table S2). The values of these
   co-benefits are not captured in our marginal abatement costs yet may
   drive NCS implementation. For example, investments in fire management
   are needed to avoid impacts on air quality and drinking water
   provision; urban forestry provides human health, aesthetic, and direct
   temperature reduction benefits; nutrient management is needed to
   improve water quality and avoid toxic algal blooms (table S2). Further,
   NCS can help provide resilience to climate change impacts on nature and
   people. For example, building soil carbon increases the resilience of
   cropland (31); protecting coastal wetlands can provide coastal defense
   against storms (32); and fire management can help avoid damaging
   wildfires (23).

   We have restricted our analysis to those opportunities where the
   literature conclusively demonstrates the potential for mitigation. This
   suggests that new research may reveal additional opportunities for NCS,
   which would increase the potential identified here. At the same time,
   substantial uncertainties exist in some NCS opportunities (Fig. 1 and
   table S1), highlighting the need for implementation to be coupled with
   monitoring and assessment of NCS.

DISCUSSION

   The United States is the largest cumulative emitter of carbon dioxide
   from fossil fuels (33). Despite the immense size of U.S. GHG emissions
   from fossil fuel use, we find that NCS have the potential to generate
   mitigation equivalent to 21% of net annual emissions. This reveals the
   important contribution to climate mitigation that the land sector can
   make, even in developed countries such as the United States.

   Globally, current NCS efforts receive only 0.8% of public and private
   climate financing (34), despite offering roughly 37% of potential
   mitigation needed through 2030 (3). One concern that may have limited
   the adoption of NCS to date includes competition with other land uses
   such as food and bioenergy production. A growing body of literature
   suggests that future global food demand can be met via investments in
   yield increases, closing yield gaps, diet shifts, aquaculture, and
   biofuel policy, without the need to further expand cropland into
   natural areas (35, 36). In the United States, marginal cropland, much
   of which is unprofitable (37), could be restored to grassland or
   forests with net societal benefits (38). Similarly, NCS may compete
   with bioenergy production. However, this conflict can be reduced or
   avoided depending on the form of bioenergy production or NCS. Some
   forms of biomass production, such as residues and wastes, or
   high-yielding methods, such as algae, do not require productive land
   (39). Our grassland restoration pathway could produce a limited amount
   of additional biomass while maintaining carbon sequestration in soils
   if low-productivity croplands are converted to perennial energy grasses
   (40). Further, NCS based on improved management of existing land uses
   do not create land use conflict and can even increase productivity
   within that land use (e.g., fire management or cover crops). However,
   aggressive expansion of dedicated bioenergy crops, given the large land
   requirement of both first- and second-generation bioenergy crops (41),
   would be likely to reduce the mitigation potential available through
   NCS, notably via reforestation, avoided grassland conversion, and
   natural forest management.

   A second concern is that ecosystems have a limited ability to store
   additional carbon. For each pathway, we quantified the duration of time
   for which mitigation is expected to occur at the rates we estimate,
   before saturation effects decrease this rate (table S1). We note that
   carbon can continue to accumulate in forests for hundreds of years and
   in soils for centuries or millennia (table S1 and the Supplementary
   Materials). Further, four of our NCS opportunities (cropland nutrient
   management, tidal wetland restoration, manure management, and improved
   rice management) are based on avoided emissions of CH[4] and N[2]O,
   which are benefits that do not saturate. The mitigation potential of
   avoided conversion of habitat is limited by the total carbon contained
   in the habitat. Our analysis assumes that rates of conversion persist
   at current levels in a BAU scenario, which would represent a continuing
   source of emissions for at least 67 years for each habitat considered
   here before reaching “saturation” when the total area has been lost.
   However, the long-term benefit of avoided conversion depends on assumed
   future BAU conversion rates.

   The permanence of the ~2270 Pg C currently stored globally in biomass
   (42) and soils to 1 m (26) is a significant concern, because
   unmitigated climate change is likely to cause feedbacks that may
   increase disturbances such as fire or pest outbreaks (43) or limit net
   ecosystem productivity or forest regeneration (24). While NCS would
   marginally increase this large carbon pool, putting some additional
   carbon at risk, rapid and widespread implementation of NCS would reduce
   the overall risk of impermanence to the terrestrial biosphere that
   unmitigated climate change is likely to cause.

   Another challenge is that avoiding conversion in one area can cause
   conversion to shift to other areas, often referred to as “leakage.”
   Large-scale sectoral and landscape approaches to land use planning and
   policies will be needed to realize the NCS opportunities identified
   here. These approaches can and should be designed to buffer risks of
   leakage associated with individual projects (44).

   Reducing carbon-intensive energy consumption is necessary but
   insufficient to meet the ambitious goals of the Paris Agreement.
   Comprehensive mitigation efforts that include fossil fuel emission
   reductions coupled with NCS hold promise for keeping warming below 2°C.
   Beyond providing meaningful climate mitigation, NCS investment can
   increase other important ecosystem services. The conservation,
   restoration, and improved management of lands in the United States
   represent a necessary and urgent component of efforts to stabilize the
   climate.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

   Below, we provide a brief overview of methods for each of the 21 NCS
   that we quantified. Full methodological details are provided in the
   Supplementary Materials.

   Reforestation: Additional carbon sequestration in above- and
   belowground biomass and soils gained by converting nonforest (<25% tree
   cover) to forest [>25% tree cover (45)] in areas of the conterminous
   United States where forests are the native cover type. We excluded
   areas with intensive human development, including all major roads (46),
   impervious surfaces (47), and urban areas (48). To eliminate double
   counting with the peatland restoration pathway, we removed Histosol
   soils (49). To safeguard food production, we removed most cropland and
   pasture. We discounted the carbon sequestration mitigation benefit in
   conifer-dominated forests to account for albedo effects.

   Natural forest management: Additional carbon sequestration in above-
   and belowground biomass gained through improved management in forests
   on private lands under nonintensive timber management. The maximum
   mitigation potential was quantified on the basis of a “harvest hiatus”
   scenario starting in 2025, in which natural forests are shifted to
   longer harvest rotations. This could be accomplished with less than 10%
   reduction in timber supply with new timber supply from thinning
   treatments for fuel risk reduction until new timber from reforestation
   is available in 2030.

   Fire management: Use of prescribed fire to reduce the risk of
   high-intensity wildfire. We considered fire-prone forests in the
   western United States. We assume that treatment eliminates the risk of
   subsequent wildfire for 20 years, but only on the land that was
   directly treated. We assume that 5% of lands are treated each year, and
   we calculated the benefits that accrue over 20 years, finding that the
   initial increase in emissions associated with prescribed fire treatment
   is more than offset over time by the avoided impacts of wildfires. We
   report the average annual benefit across these 20 years. The impact of
   wildfires includes both direct emissions from combustion and
   suppression of net ecosystem productivity following wildfires.

   Avoided forest conversion: Emissions of CO[2] avoided by avoiding
   anthropogenic forest conversion. Most forest clearing is followed by
   forest regeneration rather than conversion to another land use. To
   estimate the rate of persistent conversion (i.e., to another land use),
   we first calculated forest clearing in the conterminous United States
   from 2000 to 2010 and then used the proportion of forest clearing that
   historically was converted to another land use to estimate conversion
   rates in 2000 to 2010. We used estimates of avoided carbon emissions
   from above- and belowground biomass that are specific to each region
   and forest type. We did not count forest loss due to fire to avoid
   double counting with the improved fire management opportunity. We did
   not count forest loss due to pests because it is unclear whether this
   loss can be avoided. We reduced the benefit of avoided conversion in
   conifer-dominated forests to account for their albedo effects.

   Urban reforestation: Additional carbon sequestration in above- and
   belowground biomass gained by increasing urban tree cover. We
   considered the potential to increase urban tree cover in 3535 cities in
   the conterminous United States. We considered the potential for
   additional street trees, and for those cities not in deserts, we also
   considered the potential for park and yard tree plantings. The
   potential percent increase in tree cover was estimated on the basis of
   high-resolution analysis of 27 cities, which excluded sports fields,
   golf courses, and lawns (50).

   Improved plantations: Additional carbon sequestration gained in above-
   and belowground tree biomass by extending rotation lengths for a
   limited time in even-aged, intensively managed wood production forests.
   Rotation lengths were extended from current economic optimal rotation
   length to a biological optimal rotation length in which harvest occurs
   when stands reach their maximum annual growth.

   Cover crops: Additional soil carbon sequestration gained by growing a
   cover crop in the fallow season between main crops. We quantified the
   benefit of using cover crops on all of the five major crops in the
   United States (corn, soy, wheat, rice, and cotton) that are not already
   growing cover crops (27), using the mean sequestration rate quantified
   in a recent meta-analysis (51).

   Avoided conversion of grassland: Emissions of CO[2] avoided by avoiding
   conversion of grassland and shrubland to cropland. We quantified
   avoided emissions from soil and roots (for shrubs, we also considered
   aboveground biomass) based on the spatial pattern of conversion from
   2008 to 2012. We used spatial information on location of recent
   conversion and variation in soil carbon and root biomass to estimate
   mean annual emission rate from historic conversion. We estimated a 28%
   loss of soil carbon down to 1 m (26). We modeled spatial variation in
   root biomass based on mean annual temperature and mean annual
   precipitation using data from (52).

   Biochar: Increased soil carbon sequestration by amending agricultural
   soils with biochar, which converts nonrecalcitrant carbon (crop residue
   biomass) to recalcitrant carbon (charcoal) through pyrolysis. We
   limited the source of biochar production to crop residue that can be
   sustainably harvested. We assumed that 79.6% of biochar carbon persists
   on a time scale of >100 years (53, 54) and that there are no effects of
   biochar on emissions of N[2]O or CH[4] (55, 56).

   Alley cropping: Additional carbon sequestration gained by planting wide
   rows of trees with a companion crop grown in the alleyways between the
   rows. We estimated a maximum potential of alley cropping on 10% of U.S.
   cropland (15.4 Mha) (57).

   Cropland nutrient management: Avoided N[2]O emissions due to more
   efficient use of nitrogen fertilizers and avoided upstream emissions
   from fertilizer manufacture. We considered four improved management
   practices: (i) reduced whole-field application rate, (ii) switching
   from anhydrous ammonia to urea, (iii) improved timing of fertilizer
   application, and (iv) variable application rate within field. We
   projected a 4.6% BAU growth in fertilizer use in the United States by
   2025. On the basis of these four practices, we found a maximum
   potential of 22% reduction in nitrogen use, which leads to a 33%
   reduction in field emissions and a 29% reduction including upstream
   emissions.

   Improved manure management: Avoided CH[4] emissions from dairy and hog
   manure. We estimated the potential for emission reductions from
   improved manure management on dairy farms with over 300 cows and hog
   farms with over 825 hogs. Our calculations are based on improved
   management practices described by Pape et al. (8).

   Windbreaks: Additional sequestration in above- and belowground biomass
   and soils from planting windbreaks adjacent to croplands that would
   benefit from reduced wind erosion. We estimated that windbreaks could
   be planted on 0.88 Mha, based on an estimated 17.6 Mha that would
   benefit from windbreaks, and that windbreaks would be planted on ~5% of
   that cropland (8).

   Grazing optimization: Additional soil carbon sequestration due to
   grazing optimization on rangeland and planted pastures, derived
   directly from a recent study by Henderson et al. (58). Grazing
   optimization prescribes a decrease in stocking rates in areas that are
   overgrazed and an increase in stocking rates in areas that are
   undergrazed, but with the net result of increased forage offtake and
   livestock production.

   Grassland restoration: Additional carbon sequestration in soils and
   root biomass gained by restoring 2.1 Mha of cropland to grassland,
   equivalent to returning to the 2007 peak in CRP enrollment. Grassland
   restoration does not include restoration of shrubland.

   Legumes in pastures: Additional soil carbon sequestration due to sowing
   legumes in planted pastures, derived directly from a recent global
   study by Henderson et al. (58). Restricted to planted pastures and to
   where sowing legumes would result in net sequestration after taking
   into account potential increases in N[2]O emissions from the planted
   legumes.

   Improved rice management: Avoided emissions of CH[4] and N[2]O through
   improved practices in flooded rice cultivation. Practices including
   mid-season drainage, alternate wetting and drying, and residue removal
   can reduce these emissions. We used a U.S. Environmental Protection
   Agency (EPA) analysis that projects the potential for improvement
   across U.S. rice fields, in comparison with current agricultural
   practices (59).

   Tidal wetland restoration: In the United States, 27% of tidal wetlands
   (salt marshes and mangroves) have limited tidal connection with the
   sea, causing their salinity to decline to the point where CH[4]
   emissions increase (30). We estimated the potential for reconnecting
   these tidal wetlands to the ocean to increase salinity and reduce CH[4]
   emissions.

   Peatland restoration: Avoided carbon emissions from rewetting and
   restoring drained peatlands. To estimate the extent of restorable
   peatlands, we quantified the difference between historic peatland
   extent [based on the extent of Histosols in soil maps (60)] and current
   peatland extent. Our estimate of mitigation potential accounted for
   changes in soil carbon, biomass, and CH[4] emissions, considering
   regional differences, the type of land use of the converted peatland,
   and whether the peatland was originally forested.

   Avoided seagrass loss: Avoided CO[2] emissions from avoiding seagrass
   loss. An estimated 1.5% of seagrass extent is lost every year (61). We
   assumed that half of the carbon contained in biomass and sediment from
   disappearing seagrass beds is lost to the atmosphere (62).

   Seagrass restoration: Increased sequestration from restoring the
   estimated 29 to 52% of historic seagrass extent that has been lost and
   could be restored (61). We estimated the average carbon sequestration
   rate in the sediment of seagrass restorations based on data from six
   seagrass restoration sites in the United States (63).

Abstract

   Human sleep is highly regulated by temperature. Might climate
   change—through increases in nighttime heat—disrupt sleep in the future?
   We conduct the inaugural investigation of the relationship between
   climatic anomalies, reports of insufficient sleep, and projected
   climate change. Using data from 765,000 U.S. survey respondents from
   2002 to 2011, coupled with nighttime temperature data, we show that
   increases in nighttime temperatures amplify self-reported nights of
   insufficient sleep. We observe the largest effects during the summer
   and among both lower-income and elderly respondents. We combine our
   historical estimates with climate model projections and detail the
   potential sleep impacts of future climatic changes. Our study
   represents the largest ever investigation of the relationship between
   sleep and ambient temperature and provides the first evidence that
   climate change may disrupt human sleep.

INTRODUCTION

   Sleep is vital for healthy human functioning. Yet, approximately
   one-third of adults report sleep difficulties, making insufficient
   sleep a pressing public health issue (1). Too little sleep increases
   susceptibility to disease and chronic illness (2, 3) and harms
   psychological and cognitive functioning (4, 5). Both body temperature
   (6, 7) and ambient temperature (8, 9) significantly influence sleep
   patterns.

   Regular and sufficient sleep serves a crucial role in maintaining and
   restoring the human body. At a physiological level, sleep loss can
   undercut the neural consolidation of new knowledge (10), the repair of
   skeletal muscles (11), and the efficient removal of waste from the
   brain (12). Insufficient sleep may also compromise immune system
   functioning (13), dysregulate metabolism (14), and increase systemic
   inflammation in the body (15). The subsequent health impacts of too
   little sleep are numerous, including increased risk for cardiovascular
   disease (3), diabetes (2), and obesity (16). From a neuropsychiatric
   standpoint, acute sleep deprivation is linked to worse mood (17), and
   sleep problems may contribute to the development of depression (4) and
   suicidality (18). Moreover, restricted sleep harms cognitive
   performance via reductions in memory, attention, and processing speed
   (5). Human well-being suffers without adequate rest.

   Of the factors affecting sleep, temperature plays an integral role.
   Normal sleep-wake cycles are governed by circadian rhythms—automatic
   biological processes that follow a 24-hour clock—and thermoregulation
   is a critical determinant of both falling asleep and staying asleep
   (6). As the body prepares for sleep, dilation of blood vessels in the
   skin facilitates heat loss, producing an important signal for sleep
   onset: a decrease in core body temperature. This core temperature
   decrease is preceded by amplification of temperature at distal sites
   (for example, the hands and feet). The ratio of distal to proximal skin
   temperature is highly predictive of sleep onset (19), suggesting that
   heat loss from distal skin temperature regions helps to cool the core
   in the evening and early morning (20). Once core body temperature drops
   to produce sleep onset, it remains low throughout the night and rises
   again shortly before awakening. By affecting circadian
   thermoregulation, ambient temperatures can interrupt the normal
   physiology of sleep (21). Previous laboratory-based studies have found
   that exposure to elevated temperatures can prevent core body heat
   shedding (9) and that poor sleep is associated with elevated core body
   temperature (7).

   Here, we report on the effect of increases in nighttime temperatures on
   reported nights of insufficient sleep of 765,000 U.S. residents
   spanning the period of 2002 to 2011. Using these data, we examine four
   questions. First, have atypically high nighttime temperatures harmed
   individuals’ reported sleep quality? Second, do the effects of
   nighttime temperatures on sleep vary by season? Third, are the effects
   most acute among those least able to cope with anomalous nighttime
   heat? Finally, might nighttime warming due to climate change increase
   the incidence of insufficient sleep in the future?

RESULTS

Main effect

   To investigate whether anomalous nighttime temperatures harmed the
   sleep quality of individuals, we constructed a data set of individuals’
   reported monthly nights of insufficient sleep linked with monthly
   historical nighttime temperature data. Our individual response data
   come from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Behavioral
   Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS) pooled over the period
   2002–2011. Randomly selected respondents answered the question: “During
   the past 30 days, for about how many days have you felt you did not get
   enough rest or sleep?”

   Questions from the BRFSS have been assessed for validity (22) and
   reliability (23) and are largely consistent with other health-related
   activity measures, including our specific measure of perceived sleep
   insufficiency (24). Further, this specific question is used in widely
   cited public health studies related to sleep (25).

   We combine these individual responses—marked by interview date and
   geolocated to the city level—with station-level daily temperature and
   precipitation and climate normals data from the National Centers for
   Environmental Information Global Historical Climatology Network–Daily
   (GHCN-D) (see Cities and Stations in the Supplementary Materials) (26).
   Notably, our analysis is robust to the use of gridded daily weather
   data from the PRISM Climate Group instead (see PRISM Data in the
   Supplementary Materials) (27). Our theoretical relationship of interest
   is the effect of nighttime temperature anomalies on insufficient sleep.
   We empirically model this relationship as Embedded Image Embedded Image
   (1)where β is our parameter of interest. In this pooled cross-sectional
   model, i indexes individuals, j indexes cities, s indexes seasons, and
   t indexes calendar days (our results are robust to the use of a
   negative binomial model instead; see Negative Binomial in the
   Supplementary Materials). Our dependent variable Y[ijst] represents
   respondents’ number of nights of insufficient sleep over the past 30
   days (results are robust to dichotomizing this variable in a linear
   probability model; see Linear Probability Model in the Supplementary
   Materials). Our independent variable of interest, X[jst], represents
   the 30-day average of daily minimum temperature deviations from their
   normal daily values (from 1981 to 2010) over the same 30-day window as
   respondents’ reported nights of insufficient sleep Embedded Image
   Embedded Image (2)where r indexes the days before an individual’s
   survey response date.

   The Zη term in Eq. 1 represents a set of climatic control variables
   that include average temperature range, precipitation anomalies, cloud
   cover, and humidity [with cloud cover and humidity data drawn from the
   National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Reanalysis 2
   project (28)]. We included these other meteorological variables because
   their exclusion might bias our estimates of the effect of nighttime
   temperature anomalies (although the magnitude of β is largely
   unaffected by the exclusion of these variables; see Main Effect in the
   Supplementary Materials) (29).

   Further, unobserved characteristics may influence sleep. For example,
   people may sleep better in cities with lower noise pollution or higher
   prevalence of air conditioning, on days when they are more likely to
   have leisure time, or because of other city-specific seasonal factors.
   To be sure that geographic and temporal factors like these do not
   interfere with our estimate of the effect of nighttime temperature on
   human sleep, we included γ[t], and ν[js] in Eq. 1. These terms
   represent calendar date and city-by-season indicator variables that
   account for unobserved characteristics constant across cities and days
   as well as seasonal factors that might vary differentially by city
   (30). Notably, our results are robust to varying the specification of
   these controls (see Time and Location Controls in the Supplementary
   Materials). Our empirical identifying assumption, consistent with the
   literature (31–33), is that temperature anomalies are as good as random
   after conditioning on these fixed effects. The estimated model
   coefficient β can thus be interpreted as the effect of temperature
   anomalies on reports of insufficient sleep (34–36).

   Because our estimation procedure uses exogenous city-level variations
   in nightly temperature deviations to predict individual-level outcomes,
   we account for within-city and within-day clustering of standard errors
   by using heteroskedasticity robust errors clustered on both city and
   day. Finally, we omit nonclimatic control variables from Eq. 1 because
   of their potential to generate bias—a phenomenon known as a “bad
   control” (36)—in our parameter of interest (nonetheless, our results
   are robust to the inclusion of common demographic covariates; see
   Demographic Controls in the Supplementary Materials).

   As can be seen in Fig. 1, as temperature anomalies become more
   positive, the incidence of nights with insufficient sleep increases.
   The results of estimating Eq. 1 indicate that a +1°C deviation in
   nighttime temperatures produces an increase of approximately three
   nights of insufficient sleep per 100 individuals per month (β = 0.028,
   P = 0.014, n = 766,761). Notably, nonlinear specifications of nighttime
   temperatures, precipitation, and daily temperature range return similar
   estimates of β, and a permutation test further supports our statistical
   inference (see Main Effect and Permutation Test in the Supplementary
   Materials) (37). Putting scale to the magnitude of our estimated
   effect, a harmonized +1°C nighttime temperature anomaly, if
   extrapolated across the current population of the United States, would
   produce nearly 9 million additional nights of insufficient sleep per
   month or approximately 110 million extra nights of insufficient sleep
   annually.

   Fig. 1 Nights of insufficient sleep increase with nighttime temperature
   anomalies.

   (A) Relationship between average monthly nighttime temperature
   anomalies and 765,000 respondents’ reported number of monthly nights
   with insufficient sleep from 2002 to 2011. As temperature anomalies
   become more positive, nights with insufficient sleep become more
   frequent. Points represent the average of respondents’ monthly number
   of nights with insufficient sleep for each 0.5°C nighttime temperature
   anomaly bin. The line represents a smoothing of the raw data using a
   cubic spline fit. Shaded error bounds represent the 95% confidence
   interval of this fit. (B) Distribution of 2002–2011 average monthly
   nighttime temperature anomalies from the daily nighttime temperature
   normals of 1981–2010.

Heterogeneous effects of nighttime temperature on sleep

   The above β represents an estimate of the average effect of anomalous
   nighttime temperatures on sleep over the course of a full year.
   However, because excessive heat disrupts sleep by preventing normal
   decreases in core body temperature (9, 21, 38), above-average summer
   nighttime temperatures might plausibly harm sleep more than
   above-average temperatures in cooler periods of the year. This leads us
   to our second question: Do the effects of nighttime temperatures on
   sleep vary by season?

   To investigate this question, we stratify our sample and examine Eq. 1
   for each season of the year (excluding city-by-season indicator
   variables). We find that the effect size β during summer (β = 0.073, P
   = 0.019, n = 179,117) is almost three times the magnitude of the
   effects observed during any other season of the year, as can be seen in
   Fig. 2A. The effects during spring, fall, and winter are all positive
   but are smaller in magnitude and fail to gain significance at the α =
   0.05 level.

   Fig. 2 The effect of nighttime temperature anomalies is most acute
   during the summer and among lower-income respondents and the elderly.

   (A) Marginal effects from our main model specification run on samples
   stratified by season (rescaled to an effect per 100 individuals). The
   effects observed in the summertime sample are over double the magnitude
   of those observed in other seasons. (B) Marginal effects associated
   with splitting the sample by median income. Those with under $50,000
   per year have notably higher responses to nighttime temperature
   anomalies. (C) Sample by age, showing that the effects of nighttime
   temperature anomalies on sleep are larger in the elderly. Marginal
   effects significantly different from zero at the α = 0.05 level are
   presented in red. Error bars are SEM (see regression tables in the
   Supplementary Materials).

   In addition to heterogeneous effects by season, we may expect that not
   all individuals will be similarly affected by anomalous increases in
   nighttime temperatures. This leads us to our third question: Are the
   observed effects most acute among those least able to cope with
   nighttime heat? For example, more wealthy individuals may be able to
   afford running the air conditioning at night, whereas those in
   lower-income brackets may not (39). Further, it has been observed that
   older individuals can have deficient thermoregulation (40), which may
   make their sleep cycles more vulnerable to anomalous temperatures.

   To examine whether lower-income and elderly respondents are most
   acutely disturbed by above-average nighttime heat, we stratify our
   sample along relevant demographic covariates, again estimating Eq. 1
   for each subsample. Splitting the sample along its median income
   bracket ($50,000), we find that the effect of temperature anomalies on
   insufficient sleep is greatest for lower-income respondents (see Fig.
   2B). The effect for the lower-income group (β = 0.042, P = 0.009, n =
   342,565) is over three times the magnitude of the higher-income group
   (β = 0.012, P = 0.455, n = 322,044). Next, splitting the sample along a
   common age dimension—over or under 65 years of age—we find that our
   effects in older adults (β = 0.041, P = 0.043, n = 223,211) are nearly
   twice the magnitude of those found in younger adults (β = 0.025, P =
   0.064, n = 535,968) (see Fig. 2C).

   Combining these insights, the effect observed in a subsample of
   elderly, lower-income respondents during the summer (β = 0.175, P =
   0.007, n = 30,532) is approximately 10 times the magnitude of the
   effect observed in the remainder of the sample excluding this group (β
   = 0.018, P = 0.089, n = 735,743). Thus, our data suggest that both
   lower-income and elderly individuals may be most susceptible to
   increasing nightly temperatures and that these individuals experience
   more severe sleep disruptions in response to atypically warm summer
   nights.

Potential implications of climate change for human sleep

   Our historical data indicate that past nighttime temperature anomalies
   have likely altered historical sleep patterns in meaningful ways. In
   the future, climate change is likely to produce an increased frequency
   of above-average nighttime temperatures (see Fig. 3A) (41), and
   observed nighttime temperatures have been increasing more rapidly than
   daytime temperatures over the last century (42). These observations
   lead us to our fourth question: Might warming nighttime temperatures
   due to climate change increase the incidence of insufficient sleep in
   the future?

   Fig. 3 Climate change may amplify human sleep loss.

   (A) Distributions of nighttime temperature anomalies calculated from 21
   downscaled climate models for the cities in our sample in 2010, 2050,
   and 2099. Nighttime temperature anomalies from the 1981–2010 city
   nighttime temperature normals increase in both magnitude and variation
   by 2050 and 2099 as compared to 2010. (B) City-level forecasts for the
   impact of climate change on monthly nights of insufficient sleep per
   100 individuals. To incorporate downscaled climate model uncertainty,
   we calculate an estimated change for an ensemble of 21 climatic models
   for 219 cities, producing nearly 4600 estimates for both 2050 and 2099.
   The change between 2010 and 2050 is represented by golden lines,
   whereas the predicted change between 2050 and 2099 is represented by
   red lines. The black dashed lines plot the median predicted change
   between each period. (C) Mean predicted change in sleep for each period
   across all climate models (rescaled to an effect per 100 individuals).
   Error bars are SEM and incorporate downscaled climate model
   uncertainty.

   To examine this question, we calculate projected nighttime temperature
   anomalies for 2050 and 2099 from NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily
   Downscaled Projections (NEX-GDDP) bias-corrected, statistically
   downscaled (to 25 km × 25 km), nightly temperature projections (43)
   drawn from 21 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5
   (CMIP5) models (44) run on the Representative Concentration Pathways
   “high emissions” scenario (RCP8.5) (45). We extract the projections’
   time series for the grid cells associated with each city and couple
   these predicted anomalies with our historical estimate of the
   relationship between nighttime temperature anomalies and insufficient
   sleep—β from Eq. 1—to calculate a forecast of possible insufficient
   sleep due to future nighttime warming at the city level for each
   downscaled climate model. We define our forecast of the increase in
   insufficient nights of sleep due to climate change by 2050 (ΔY[mj2050])
   as Embedded Image Embedded Image (3)and for the additional effect from
   2050 to 2099 (ΔY[mj2099]) as Embedded Image Embedded Image (4)where m
   indexes the 21 specific climate models, j indexes the city, and t
   indexes the day. X[mjt]—our measure of 30-day nighttime temperature
   anomalies—is calculated as in Eq. 2, using 1981–2010 as the baseline.
   This forecasting procedure enables us to incorporate uncertainty
   regarding future downscaled climatic projections into our forecast
   (29). Figure 3B plots the estimation results. Each of the 219 cities in
   our analysis has a prediction for each of the 21 downscaled climate
   models, producing approximately 4600 estimates per period. On average,
   we project that climate change may cause approximately 6 additional
   nights of insufficient sleep per 100 individuals by 2050 and an excess
   of approximately 14 nights per 100 individuals by 2099 (see Fig. 3C).

   In addition, the effects of climate change on nighttime
   temperatures—and thus the potential impacts of climate change on
   sleep—are likely to vary geographically across the United States. To
   investigate the spatial distribution of potential reductions in
   sufficient sleep due to climate change, we take the ensemble average of
   the 21 NEX downscaled climate models for each of the 2010, 2050, and
   2099 forecasts. We then take the yearly average of nighttime
   temperature anomalies for each grid cell in the continental United
   States in each year. For the 2050 forecast, we assign to each grid cell
   the difference in average nighttime temperature anomaly between 2010
   and 2050. For the 2099 forecast, we assign to each grid cell the
   difference in average anomalies between 2010 and 2099. As can be seen
   in Fig. 4—with effects scaled to be per 100 individuals—areas of the
   western and northern United States are likely to have the most
   significant changes in nighttime temperatures and, as a result, may see
   the greatest increase in climate change–induced nights of insufficient
   sleep.

   Fig. 4 Geographic dispersion of the predicted effects of climate
   change–induced nighttime warming on human sleep.

   This figure presents the 25-km × 25-km grid cell forecasts of the
   potential impact of nighttime warming on monthly nights of insufficient
   sleep per 100 individuals. Downscaled climatic model data are averaged
   across the 21 models in the ensemble and then coupled with our
   historical model parameter β to produce an estimated change in
   insufficient sleep in each geographic location for the periods of 2050
   and 2099. Areas of the western and northern United States—where
   nighttime temperatures are projected to increase most acutely—may
   experience the largest future changes in sleep.

DISCUSSION

   Our analysis of historical data demonstrates a robust link between
   atypical nightly temperatures and insufficient sleep that is largest
   during the summer and among lower-income individuals and the elderly.
   Moreover, across both our city-level and geographic grid cell–level
   forecasts, we predict that every location in the United States may
   experience an increased incidence of insufficient sleep due to
   nighttime warming induced by future climate change.

   These findings correspond to a growing literature on the close ties
   between temperature, climate, and human health and well-being (35).
   Recent studies have demonstrated the effects of temperature on
   mortality and morbidity (46–50) as well as on psychological states and
   propensity for crime and other forms of violence (51–54), although, to
   our knowledge, ours is the first study to examine the implications of
   climate change for human sleep.

   There are several considerations important to the interpretation of the
   results of this study. First, although we have data on hundreds of
   thousands of individuals’ reports of insufficient sleep, optimal data
   would also contain objective measurements of each individual’s nightly
   sleep duration. Reports of insufficient sleep may be driven due to
   actual sleep loss, but they may also be driven by other factors such as
   excess fatigue due to warmer than normal temperatures.

   This point raises a second consideration: Here, we focus on the average
   treatment effect of nighttime temperature anomalies on a measure of
   sleep sufficiency. Yet, it is likely that there are interactive effects
   between sleep and other physiological and psychological metrics. Future
   study of these other metrics will be important to help identify the
   causal mechanisms underpinning our results. Third, future attainment of
   sufficient sleep will be determined by factors in addition to nighttime
   temperatures—including use of technology, hours worked, stress levels,
   changes to the built environment (55), and many others—that may each
   trend differentially going forward. The potential effects of nighttime
   warming on sleep may be exacerbated or even reduced by these other
   sleep-related trends. Further studies are needed to clarify how
   increased nighttime temperatures may interact with these factors.
   Fourth, because respondents are geolocated to the city level,
   measurement error may exist between the nighttime temperatures observed
   at weather stations and the temperatures respondents actually
   experienced, possibly attenuating the size of our estimates (56). This,
   in turn, suggests that our results may represent a lower bound for the
   estimate of “business as usual” climate change on human sleep. Finally,
   our analysis is conducted on a randomly sampled, pooled cross section
   of respondents. An ideal source of data would track the same
   individuals over time to enable controlling for individual-specific
   characteristics.

   Ultimately, if observed temperature-sleep relationships from the recent
   past persist, further climate change–induced nighttime warming may
   reduce the attainment of sufficient sleep, magnifying many of the
   physiological and psychological costs of sleep deprivation. These costs
   may be most acute for the poor and elderly. Although adaptations to
   changing nighttime temperature distributions may mitigate some or all
   of these sleep effects, positive feedback loops from the other
   potential social impacts of climate change—such as increased stress,
   acute trauma, and interpersonal conflict—could amplify them.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

   We collected data for this project from the public domain. We used the
   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention BRFSS Selected
   Metropolitan/Micropolitan Area Risk Trends product for our measure of
   nights of insufficient sleep. We gathered daily meteorological data
   from the National Centers for Environmental Information GHCN-D product,
   the NCEP Reanalysis 2, and the PRISM Climate Group. In addition, we
   incorporated climate model data from the NEX-GDDP bias-corrected,
   statistically downscaled models.

Abstract

   The rapid growth of the use and disposal of plastic materials has
   proved to be a challenge for solid waste management systems with
   impacts on our environment and ocean. While recycling and the circular
   economy have been touted as potential solutions, upward of half of the
   plastic waste intended for recycling has been exported to hundreds of
   countries around the world. China, which has imported a cumulative 45%
   of plastic waste since 1992, recently implemented a new policy banning
   the importation of most plastic waste, begging the question of where
   the plastic waste will go now. We use commodity trade data for mass and
   value, region, and income level to illustrate that higher-income
   countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation have been
   exporting plastic waste (70% in 2016) to lower-income countries in the
   East Asia and Pacific for decades. An estimated 111 million metric tons
   of plastic waste will be displaced with the new Chinese policy by 2030.
   As 89% of historical exports consist of polymer groups often used in
   single-use plastic food packaging (polyethylene, polypropylene, and
   polyethylene terephthalate), bold global ideas and actions for reducing
   quantities of nonrecyclable materials, redesigning products, and
   funding domestic plastic waste management are needed.

INTRODUCTION

   Plastic has become a major commodity on a global scale and has
   infiltrated almost every aspect of human life. The historic growth in
   production has outpaced almost all other manufactured materials from 2
   million metric tons (MT) produced in 1950 to 322 million MT produced in
   2015 (1, 2). A cumulative total of 8.3 billion MT of plastic has been
   produced as of 2017 (1). Plastic is a very useful material (moldable,
   durable, light, and inexpensive), and packaging is the most significant
   sector (40%) of use (2). Plastic as a material for packaging has had
   significant advantages, allowing companies to market effectively,
   design appealing-looking and appealing-feeling packages, prevent loss
   from store shelves, and transport goods efficiently and economically
   throughout the world. However, plastic packaging for food, beverage,
   and tobacco items is often used only once, which has contributed to 61%
   of global beach litter (3).

   While the use of plastic has expanded quickly, little thought has been
   given to the impact of this growing use on solid waste management
   systems, which have had to react to the influx of new and variable
   materials entering the solid waste stream. Plastic packaging and
   single-use items enter the waste stream immediately after use,
   contributing to a cumulative total of 6.3 billion MT of plastic waste
   generated worldwide (1). Management of this large increase and quantity
   of plastic waste has been challenging, particularly in areas of rapid
   economic development and population growth. Only 9% of plastic waste
   has been recycled globally, with the overwhelming majority of global
   plastic waste being landfilled or ending up contaminating the
   environment (80%), resulting in an estimated 4 million to 12 million MT
   of waste plastic entering the oceans annually (1, 4).

   Plastics can be challenging to recycle because of the wide variety of
   uses, additives, and blends that are used in a multitude of products
   (5), as well as the fact that there are material properties that can
   limit the number of times that products can be recycled. Commingled and
   single-stream recycling operations have also contributed to more
   contamination than ever before in the recycling stream, especially for
   plastic waste, but the emerging markets in China in the 1990s found
   that the material could be used profitably, especially when ships could
   efficiently deliver the material, and that it could be used to
   manufacture more goods for sale or export. For exporting countries,
   shipping-processed plastic waste to China and surrounding countries has
   provided an outlet for managing plastic waste, preventing it from going
   to landfill or incineration in the source countries (6).

   China has increasingly implemented more rigid waste import policies,
   starting prior to 2010 (7). Then, in 2013, the relationship between
   plastic waste exporters and China as the primary importer was disrupted
   when China introduced a temporary restriction on waste imports that
   required significantly less contamination. This operation was referred
   to as the “Green Fence” and highlighted the fragility of global
   dependence on a single importer. The goal of the Green Fence campaign
   was to increase the quality of the plastic waste that China was
   receiving while also reducing illegal foreign smuggling and trading
   (6). While informal (that is, undocumented) flows of plastic waste are
   known to occur, available data from the European Union (EU) estimate
   that these instances are a fraction of the waste that which is legally
   traded and documented. That said, the Green Fence succeeded in its
   aforementioned goals; however, it did not entirely stop the informal
   flow of plastic waste, and true quantities are unknown at this time.
   While the Green Fence campaign was temporary, in 2017, China announced
   a new import policy permanently banning the import of nonindustrial
   plastic waste (8).

   Here, we quantify the cascading impacts of this new Chinese import ban.
   We characterize the rapid globalization of management of plastic waste,
   identifying major import and export trends by region and income level.
   Twenty-eight years of data (1988–2016) were compiled from the United
   Nations (UN) Comtrade Database on the imports and exports of the
   category “plastic waste, parings, and scrap” for four polymer
   classifications: polyethylene (PE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC),
   polystyrene (PS), and others (9–12) reported by mass (in kilograms) and
   trade value (in U.S. dollars). The “other” plastics group includes
   plastic waste polymers that do not yet have an internationally
   harmonized code used for reporting but encompasses trade of polymers
   such as polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). To
   quantify the magnitude of the Chinese regulations regarding imports of
   forbidden and constrained waste items, we estimated the quantity of
   plastic waste that would be displaced on the basis of historical
   cumulative imports of plastic waste into China. Historical cumulative
   import data were projected forward in a business-as-usual (BAU)
   scenario using a best-fit trendline analysis, bounded by upper and
   lower estimates (figs. S1 to S4).

RESULTS

   Global annual imports and exports of plastic waste began to rapidly
   increase in 1993, having grown 723 and 817% in 2016, respectively (Fig.
   1). In 2016 alone, about half of all plastic waste intended for
   recycling (14.1 million MT) was exported by 123 countries, with China
   taking most of it (7.35 million MT) from 43 different countries (Fig.
   2) (9–13). Since it began reporting in 1992, China has imported 106
   million MT of plastic waste, making up 45.1% of all cumulative imports
   (Table 1). Collectively, China and Hong Kong have imported 72.4% of all
   plastic waste. However, Hong Kong acts as an entry port into China,
   with most of the plastic waste imported to Hong Kong (63%) going
   directly to China as an export in 2016. With the projected BAU Chinese
   import data, an estimated cumulative 111 million MT of plastic waste
   will be displaced by 2030 (Fig. 3). The displaced plastic waste is
   equal to nearly half (47%) of all plastic waste that has been imported
   globally since reporting began in 1988.

   Fig. 3 Estimated mass of global displaced plastic waste due to the new
   Chinese import ban based on cumulative imports of PE, PS, PVC, and
   other plastics into China [UN Comtrade data; (9–12)].

   The BAU (business as usual) projection of Chinese imports was created
   by using a linear regression of the last 10 years of imports. The
   Chinese ban on importation of plastic waste is based on a 100%
   implementation of the regulation (see the Supplementary Materials for
   details).

   High Income (HIC) countries have overwhelmingly been the primary
   exporters of plastic waste since 1988, contributing to 87% of all
   exports and valued at $71 billion USD (Table 1 and table S1). Imports
   of plastic waste are almost evenly split between HIC and Upper Middle
   Income (UMI) countries, which collectively account for 96% of all
   imports and are valued at $106 billion USD (Table 1 and table S1). All
   of the top 10 countries exporting plastic waste are HIC, except for
   Mexico (UMI) ranking fifth. Seven of the top 10 countries importing
   plastic waste are HIC as well, except for China (first), India (ninth),
   and other Asia not elsewhere specified (see note # in Table 1). If
   taken collectively, then the EU-28 would be the top exporter.

   Regionally, EAP (East Asia and Pacific) countries are characterized as
   the leading exporters of plastic waste; however, this is because of the
   large flow of exports from Hong Kong to China (fig. S5). Excluding Hong
   Kong, ECA (Europe and Central Asia) countries lead in exporting (for
   example, Germany, UK, and Netherlands), contributing to 32% ($27.6
   billion USD) of all exports, followed by NA countries (United States
   and Canada) contributing to 14% ($14.3 billion USD) of exports (see
   footnote ∥ in Table 1 and table S2). EAP countries have dominated the
   import of plastic waste, having imported 75% ($83.3 billion USD) of
   plastic waste imports since 1988 (table S2). Collectively, the nation
   members of the OECD have contributed to 64% ($57.4 billion USD) of all
   exports, suggesting that the trade of plastic waste may largely be
   occurring between OECD and EAP countries (see note 2 in table S2).
   Furthermore, 33 of 35 OECD countries are considered HIC, 90% of the top
   10 exporting countries are members of the OECD, and 23 of 36 EAP
   countries are low- or middle-income countries. These findings are
   consistent with historical trends of waste management practices in
   which low- and middle-income countries often import waste material for
   recycling (14). Consequently, wealthier nations, with more robust waste
   management infrastructure, are sending plastic waste to countries that
   are still developing economically with less-developed waste management
   infrastructure. Relatively high domestic management costs in exporting
   countries versus the cheaper processing fees in China have driven the
   trends illustrated here (for example, it is often cheaper to transport
   recycled materials by ship to China than it is to transport
   domestically by truck or rail) (15). In addition, exporting countries
   have preserved solid waste management capacity by sending waste to
   China where there are progressive environmental policies related to
   circular economy (for example, Environmental Protection Law, Circular
   Economy Promotion Law, etc.) (16); however, implementation of these
   policies has lagged, largely because of the top-down approach that has
   been taken, which lacks social and environmental indicators supporting
   market-based policy and public participation (16, 17).

   Of the four polymer groups, the “other plastics” group is the most
   commonly traded plastic waste comprising a cumulative 131 million MT
   imported ($61.5 billion USD) and 123 million MT exported ($50.4 billion
   USD) traded between 1988 and 2016, followed by PE, which has had 67
   million MT exported ($25.5 billion USD) and 71 million MT imported
   ($33.2 billion USD) since 1988 (fig. S6). Within this time period,
   China has imported primarily other plastics and PE (fig. S7). Excluding
   Hong Kong, the United States is the leading exporter of PVC and other
   plastics. Germany is the leading exporter of PE, and Japan is the
   leading exporter of PS. Each of these countries remains in the list of
   top five cumulative exporters for all four polymer groups. China is the
   leading importer of three of four polymer groups (table S3), with Hong
   Kong leading China in importing PS.

DISCUSSION

   China is still developing solid waste management infrastructure, and an
   estimated 1.3 million to 3.5 million MT of plastic is estimated to
   enter the oceans annually from its coastline (4). Using population
   data, waste generation rates, and percent plastic in the waste stream,
   we estimated the contribution of imports to the domestic waste stream
   in China. On the basis of the data from 2010 to 2016, the import of
   plastic waste to China contributes 10 to 13% additional mass to the
   domestic plastic waste that is already generated within the country and
   is difficult to manage. In 2016, the imports (7.35 million MT)
   contributed another 10.8% of waste to the 60.9 million MT of plastic
   waste estimated to be generated in China (table S4).

   The UN Comtrade data alone cannot accurately portray what is happening
   to plastic waste worldwide and does not trace the movement of waste
   between countries, which is a limitation of this research. For example,
   while we did obtain industry data showing that the United States
   imports plastic waste from Mexico, we do not know whether that waste is
   then processed domestically or exported to Hong Kong or China. The fact
   that plastic waste transfer between countries can be convoluted
   provides impetus for closely monitoring plastic waste to accurately
   track and better manage it. In addition, two of the most commonly used
   polymers, PET and PP, lack specific data because trade codes for these
   waste materials are not yet harmonized.

   In 2013, the Chinese Green Fence campaign resulted in a reduction of
   plastic waste accepted at the Chinese border, with some shipments being
   turned away and sent back to the source countries. As a result, plastic
   recycling industries experienced a globally cascading effect since
   little infrastructure exists elsewhere to manage the rejected waste. A
   $446 million USD and $298 million USD reduction in export and import
   trade values, respectively, occurred from 2012 to 2013 (Fig. 1). While
   the value of plastic waste trade did not recover to levels seen before
   the Green Fence, it remained significant in 2016, and the Green Fence
   was only a small sample of the potential impact of the recent policy
   banning waste imports. Furthermore, since it restricts legal trade, the
   new import ban policy could increase the informal and illegal flow of
   plastic waste.

   Suggestions from the recycling industry demonstrate that, if no
   adjustments are made in solid waste management, and plastic waste
   management in particular, then much of the waste originally diverted
   from landfills by consumers paying for a recycling service will
   ultimately be landfilled (6). Furthermore, it is possible that EAP
   countries surrounding China could also receive the displaced plastic
   waste; however, many of these countries lack the infrastructure to
   manage their own plastic waste, let alone a rapid increase in plastic
   waste supplied by other countries. While there are some country-level
   assessments that exist (for example, World Bank, OECD, etc.), there is
   no global standard for the classification of countries that have
   sufficient infrastructure to manage imported plastic waste.

   Both the displaced plastic waste and future increases in plastic
   recycling must be addressed immediately. Initially, the countries
   exporting the most plastic waste can use this as an opportunity to
   develop and expand internal markets. If domestic recycling of plastic
   waste is not possible, then this constraint reinforces the motivation
   to reduce use and redesign plastic packaging and products so that they
   retain their value and are more recyclable in domestic markets. In
   addition, the import and export of plastic waste are another
   justification for a global agreement relating to the use and management
   of plastic materials called for previously (18, 19). Of relevance to
   this discussion is the fact that the international Basel Convention,
   which governs the export of hazardous and other waste, already exists.
   For example, if plastic waste were characterized as a “waste requiring
   special consideration” (Y46) under the Basel Convention, then export
   could potentially be regulated. Basel also provides a framework for
   knowledge sharing and promoting the proper management of waste,
   including harmonization of technical standards and practices, which
   could help build capacity to properly manage plastic waste around the
   world. One legal concept that could be applied to the management of
   plastic waste is strict liability, holding both waste producers and
   exporters accountable for making sure that the material they ship is
   properly managed by any receiving entity. Lastly, each country wishing
   to continue to import significant quantities of plastic waste could
   consider an import tax specifically to fund the development of solid
   waste management infrastructure within that country.

   With plastic production and use continuing to rise, and companies and
   countries both committing to circular economies and increasing plastic
   recycling rates, the quantity of plastic waste needing a “home” will
   continue to increase for the foreseeable future. Where will the plastic
   waste go now? Without bold new ideas and management strategies, current
   recycling rates will no longer be met, and ambitious goals and
   timelines for future recycling growth will be insurmountable.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Historical trade of plastic waste

   The UN Comtrade Database provides the most comprehensive international
   trade data regarding imports and exports of many commodities. Trade
   data were organized on the basis of the Harmonized Commodity
   Description and Coding Systems (HS), which was implemented by the UN in
   1988. This system provides an international nomenclature structure for
   international trade commodities. Countries and regions can report data
   regarding traded items based on the given code. Reported trade flows
   include net weight (in kilograms) of exports, imports, reexports, and
   reimports. In addition, trade values associated with annual trade of
   plastic waste were provided by the UN database in U.S. dollars. Annual
   values were based on reported tonnage and corresponding trade values
   between 1 January and 31 December each year. Within the UN Comtrade
   data is information regarding the global trade of plastic waste
   including waste, parings, and scraps of PE (3915.10), PS (3915.20), PVC
   (3915.30), and other plastics (3915.90) (9–12). Other plastics include
   trade data for plastic waste polymers that do not have an individual HS
   trading code such as PP and PET.

   Any commodity, including plastic waste, can be reimported and
   reexported for a variety of reasons. According to the UN, reexported
   material may be “defective, the importer might have defaulted on
   payments or canceled the order, the authorities might have imposed an
   import barrier, or demand or prices in the country of origin might have
   made it worthwhile to bring the good back” (20). Both the reimport and
   reexport values were incorporated into the overall trade quantities
   reported in this study and contributed only 0.02 and 9.3% of all global
   imports and exports since 1988.

   Since the implementation of the HS, trade information for plastic waste
   as commodities was reported by 191 countries from 1988 to 2016. Of the
   four plastic waste categories, 175 countries reported exports greater
   than 0 MT, and 190 have reported imports greater than 0 MT. Because of
   geopolitical changes in national boundaries and names, trade data were
   combined for some reporting countries and territories. For example,
   data from 1988 to 1990 were reported by the “Former Federal Republic of
   Germany.” Data from 1991 to 2016 were reported by “Germany.” These two
   data sets were combined and reported as Germany. In addition, data from
   each of the 28 nations participating in the EU were combined for
   comparison of Europe’s trading of plastic waste (see footnote ¶ in
   Table 1). It should be noted that variation in how reporting is done,
   valuation between the commodity source and destination country, and
   timing of reporting can affect the consistency and reliability of the
   data.

   The available data for PE, PS, PVC, and other plastics from 1988 to
   2016 were used to determine historical and regional trends of
   international trade of plastic waste in terms of net weight and trade
   value. We analyzed trade patterns over time by country, income level
   and region, and individual polymer. Data were compiled and sorted for
   all reporting countries for each of the four plastic waste polymers. In
   addition, World Bank regional assignments and income levels were
   applied to every reporting country for all trade flows, plastic waste
   polymer categories, and years in which data were available. Economic
   classifications were based on 2015 gross national income estimations
   reported by the World Bank (21). Regional classifications were assigned
   on the basis of the current World Bank assignment groups (22, 23).
   Cumulative values of traded recycled waste from 1988 to 2016 were used
   to create historical rankings of reporting countries, income status,
   world regions, and polymers (Table 1 and tables S1 to S3).

   Finally, cumulative values were used to show geographic trends by
   country in ArcGIS 10.4 (Fig. 2 and figs. S8 to S12). Quantitative
   symbolization based on cumulative net weight of traded recycled
   polymers was used to provide geographic understanding of trade of
   plastic waste. Radial flow maps were generated using the Data
   Management XY to Line tool for the 2016 exports of PE, PS, and PVC from
   the top five historical exporters excluding Hong Kong (United States,
   Japan, Germany, Mexico, and UK) (figs. S8 to S12) (24–26). Sources of
   Chinese imports of plastic waste in 2016 were visualized by radial flow
   maps, weighted, and shaded on the basis of reported net weight (Fig. 1)
   (13).

Displaced plastic waste

   To estimate the quantity of plastic waste displaced by the new Chinese
   regulations, we examined historical trends for the import of plastic
   waste into China. The projection assumed that no imports of plastic
   waste were made after the implementation of the regulations as of 31
   December 2017 as per the Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection
   announcement. Overall, the new regulations ban the following categories
   of items: (i) forbidden items (n = 125), (ii) constrained items (n =
   32), and (iii) allowed items (n = 18) (8). Forbidden wastes are no
   longer allowed to be imported into China, and constrained waste is only
   accepted if it meets specific material standards. Eight types of
   plastic waste from consumer goods are now banned including plastic
   waste polymers of PE, PS, PVC, PET, and others (for example, PP), as
   well as bales of PET plastic bottles, aluminum plastic film, and
   compact disk/digital video disks. Industrial plastic waste that meets
   Chinese control standard GB 16487.12 is still conditionally accepted
   (27).

   The displaced plastic was represented by the difference between the
   projected BAU cumulative Chinese imports in 2030 and the 100%
   implementation of the ban in 2030. Three different regression fits were
   made using (i) a linear fit of all the data (1988–2016) that resulted
   in fig. S1 and a coefficient of determination (R^2) of 0.89, (ii) a
   second-order polynomial fit of all the data (1988–2016) that resulted
   in fig. S2 and an R^2 of 1.0, and (iii) a linear fit of the linear part
   of the curve, in the last 10 years (2006–2016), which resulted in fig.
   S3 and an R^2 of 1.0. The highest and lowest of these projections were
   used to bound our estimate of displaced plastic. The “best” estimate is
   in between the linear regression of all the data (projected at 63.3
   million MT) and the second-order polynomial (projected at 195 million
   MT). Thus, the 10-year linear regression estimate of 111 million MT
   became the best estimate (fig. S4). Although the announcement of the
   new regulations suggested complete restrictions on the imports of
   recycled waste, analyses of 50 and 75% restriction scenarios were
   provided. The quantity of displaced plastic waste was calculated for
   the year, immediately following the restrictions (2018), and every 5
   years from 2020 to 2030 (table S5).

Impact of imported plastic waste in China

   The imported plastic waste into China has an impact on their existing
   waste stream. To examine this impact, the population of China for years
   2010 to 2016 was obtained from the World Bank. Values for Chinese waste
   generation rates and percent plastic in the waste stream were obtained
   from Jambeck et al. (4). Waste generation rates were multiplied by the
   population and converted to years and MT to calculate the plastic waste
   generation (in MT) per year. We then summed the plastic waste
   generation values and imported plastic waste values to determine the
   total waste to be managed within China per year. Finally, the impact
   was estimated by the percentage of plastic waste that was imported each
   year divided by the total waste to be managed.

Abstract

   Plastics have outgrown most man-made materials and have long been under
   environmental scrutiny. However, robust global information,
   particularly about their end-of-life fate, is lacking. By identifying
   and synthesizing dispersed data on production, use, and end-of-life
   management of polymer resins, synthetic fibers, and additives, we
   present the first global analysis of all mass-produced plastics ever
   manufactured. We estimate that 8300 million metric tons (Mt) as of
   virgin plastics have been produced to date. As of 2015, approximately
   6300 Mt of plastic waste had been generated, around 9% of which had
   been recycled, 12% was incinerated, and 79% was accumulated in
   landfills or the natural environment. If current production and waste
   management trends continue, roughly 12,000 Mt of plastic waste will be
   in landfills or in the natural environment by 2050.

INTRODUCTION

   A world without plastics, or synthetic organic polymers, seems
   unimaginable today, yet their large-scale production and use only dates
   back to ~1950. Although the first synthetic plastics, such as Bakelite,
   appeared in the early 20th century, widespread use of plastics outside
   of the military did not occur until after World War II. The ensuing
   rapid growth in plastics production is extraordinary, surpassing most
   other man-made materials. Notable exceptions are materials that are
   used extensively in the construction sector, such as steel and cement
   (1, 2).

   Instead, plastics’ largest market is packaging, an application whose
   growth was accelerated by a global shift from reusable to single-use
   containers. As a result, the share of plastics in municipal solid waste
   (by mass) increased from less than 1% in 1960 to more than 10% by 2005
   in middle- and high-income countries (3). At the same time, global
   solid waste generation, which is strongly correlated with gross
   national income per capita, has grown steadily over the past five
   decades (4, 5).

   The vast majority of monomers used to make plastics, such as ethylene
   and propylene, are derived from fossil hydrocarbons. None of the
   commonly used plastics are biodegradable. As a result, they accumulate,
   rather than decompose, in landfills or the natural environment (6). The
   only way to permanently eliminate plastic waste is by destructive
   thermal treatment, such as combustion or pyrolysis. Thus,
   near-permanent contamination of the natural environment with plastic
   waste is a growing concern. Plastic debris has been found in all major
   ocean basins (6), with an estimated 4 to 12 million metric tons (Mt) of
   plastic waste generated on land entering the marine environment in 2010
   alone (3). Contamination of freshwater systems and terrestrial habitats
   is also increasingly reported (7–9), as is environmental contamination
   with synthetic fibers (9, 10). Plastic waste is now so ubiquitous in
   the environment that it has been suggested as a geological indicator of
   the proposed Anthropocene era (11).

   We present the first global analysis of all mass-produced plastics ever
   made by developing and combining global data on production, use, and
   end-of-life fate of polymer resins, synthetic fibers, and additives
   into a comprehensive material flow model. The analysis includes
   thermoplastics, thermosets, polyurethanes (PURs), elastomers, coatings,
   and sealants but focuses on the most prevalent resins and fibers:
   high-density polyethylene (PE), low-density and linear low-density PE,
   polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), polyvinylchloride (PVC),
   polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and PUR resins; and polyester,
   polyamide, and acrylic (PP&A) fibers. The pure polymer is mixed with
   additives to enhance the properties of the material.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

   Global production of resins and fibers increased from 2 Mt in 1950 to
   380 Mt in 2015, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.4% (table
   S1), roughly 2.5 times the CAGR of the global gross domestic product
   during that period (12, 13). The total amount of resins and fibers
   manufactured from 1950 through 2015 is 7800 Mt. Half of this—3900
   Mt—was produced in just the past 13 years. Today, China alone accounts
   for 28% of global resin and 68% of global PP&A fiber production
   (13–15). Bio-based or biodegradable plastics currently have a global
   production capacity of only 4 Mt and are excluded from this analysis
   (16).

   We compiled production statistics for resins, fibers, and additives
   from a variety of industry sources and synthesized them according to
   type and consuming sector (table S2 and figs. S1 and S2) (12–24). Data
   on fiber and additives production are not readily available and have
   typically been omitted until now. On average, we find that nonfiber
   plastics contain 93% polymer resin and 7% additives by mass. When
   including additives in the calculation, the amount of nonfiber plastics
   (henceforth defined as resins plus additives) manufactured since 1950
   increases to 7300 Mt. PP&A fibers add another 1000 Mt. Plasticizers,
   fillers, and flame retardants account for about three quarters of all
   additives (table S3). The largest groups in total nonfiber plastics
   production are PE (36%), PP (21%), and PVC (12%), followed by PET, PUR,
   and PS (<10% each). Polyester, most of which is PET, accounts for 70%
   of all PP&A fiber production. Together, these seven groups account for
   92% of all plastics ever made. Approximately 42% of all nonfiber
   plastics have been used for packaging, which is predominantly composed
   of PE, PP, and PET. The building and construction sector, which has
   used 69% of all PVC, is the next largest consuming sector, using 19% of
   all nonfiber plastics (table S2).

   We combined plastic production data with product lifetime distributions
   for eight different industrial use sectors, or product categories, to
   model how long plastics are in use before they reach the end of their
   useful lifetimes and are discarded (22, 25–29). We assumed log-normal
   distributions with means ranging from less than 1 year, for packaging,
   to decades, for building and construction (Fig. 1). This is a commonly
   used modeling approach to estimating waste generation for specific
   materials (22, 25, 26). A more direct way to measure plastic waste
   generation is to combine solid waste generation data with waste
   characterization information, as in the study of Jambeck et al. (3).
   However, for many countries, these data are not available in the detail
   and quality required for the present analysis.

   Fig. 1 Product lifetime distributions for the eight industrial use
   sectors plotted as log-normal probability distribution functions (PDF).

   Note that sectors other and textiles have the same PDF.

   We estimate that in 2015, 407 Mt of primary plastics (plastics
   manufactured from virgin materials) entered the use phase, whereas 302
   Mt left it. Thus, in 2015, 105 Mt were added to the in-use stock. For
   comparison, we estimate that plastic waste generation in 2010 was 274
   Mt, which is equal to the independently derived estimate of 275 Mt by
   Jambeck et al. (3). The different product lifetimes lead to a
   substantial shift in industrial use sector and polymer type between
   plastics entering and leaving use in any given year (tables S4 and S5
   and figs. S1 to S4). Most of the packaging plastics leave use the same
   year they are produced, whereas construction plastics leaving use were
   produced decades earlier, when production quantities were much lower.
   For example, in 2015, 42% of primary nonfiber plastics produced (146
   Mt) entered use as packaging and 19% (65 Mt) as construction, whereas
   nonfiber plastic waste leaving use was 54% packaging (141 Mt) and only
   5% construction (12 Mt). Similarly, in 2015, PVC accounted for 11% of
   nonfiber plastics production (38 Mt) and only 6% of nonfiber plastic
   waste generation (16 Mt).

   By the end of 2015, all plastic waste ever generated from primary
   plastics had reached 5800 Mt, 700 Mt of which were PP&A fibers. There
   are essentially three different fates for plastic waste. First, it can
   be recycled or reprocessed into a secondary material (22, 26).
   Recycling delays, rather than avoids, final disposal. It reduces future
   plastic waste generation only if it displaces primary plastic
   production (30); however, because of its counterfactual nature, this
   displacement is extremely difficult to establish (31). Furthermore,
   contamination and the mixing of polymer types generate secondary
   plastics of limited or low technical and economic value. Second,
   plastics can be destroyed thermally. Although there are emerging
   technologies, such as pyrolysis, which extracts fuel from plastic
   waste, to date, virtually all thermal destruction has been by
   incineration, with or without energy recovery. The environmental and
   health impacts of waste incinerators strongly depend on emission
   control technology, as well as incinerator design and operation.
   Finally, plastics can be discarded and either contained in a managed
   system, such as sanitary landfills, or left uncontained in open dumps
   or in the natural environment.

   We estimate that 2500 Mt of plastics—or 30% of all plastics ever
   produced—are currently in use. Between 1950 and 2015, cumulative waste
   generation of primary and secondary (recycled) plastic waste amounted
   to 6300 Mt. Of this, approximately 800 Mt (12%) of plastics have been
   incinerated and 600 Mt (9%) have been recycled, only 10% of which have
   been recycled more than once. Around 4900 Mt—60% of all plastics ever
   produced—were discarded and are accumulating in landfills or in the
   natural environment (Fig. 2). Of this, 600 Mt were PP&A fibers. None of
   the mass-produced plastics biodegrade in any meaningful way; however,
   sunlight weakens the materials, causing fragmentation into particles
   known to reach millimeters or micrometers in size (32). Research into
   the environmental impacts of these “microplastics” in marine and
   freshwater environments has accelerated in recent years (33), but
   little is known about the impacts of plastic waste in land-based
   ecosystems.

   Fig. 2 Global production, use, and fate of polymer resins, synthetic
   fibers, and additives (1950 to 2015; in million metric tons).

   Before 1980, plastic recycling and incineration were negligible. Since
   then, only nonfiber plastics have been subject to significant recycling
   efforts. The following results apply to nonfiber plastic only: Global
   recycling and incineration rates have slowly increased to account for
   18 and 24%, respectively, of nonfiber plastic waste generated in 2014
   (figs. S5 and S6). On the basis of limited available data, the highest
   recycling rates in 2014 were in Europe (30%) and China (25%), whereas
   in the United States, plastic recycling has remained steady at 9% since
   2012 (12, 13, 34–36). In Europe and China, incineration rates have
   increased over time to reach 40 and 30%, respectively, in 2014 (13,
   35). However, in the United States, nonfiber plastics incineration
   peaked at 21% in 1995 before decreasing to 16% in 2014 as recycling
   rates increased, with discard rates remaining constant at 75% during
   that time period (34). Waste management information for 52 other
   countries suggests that in 2014, the rest of the world had recycling
   and incineration rates similar to those of the United States (37). To
   date, end-of-life textiles (fiber products) do not experience
   significant recycling rates and are thus incinerated or discarded
   together with other solid waste.

   Primary plastics production data describe a robust time trend
   throughout its entire history. If production were to continue on this
   curve, humankind will have produced 26,000 Mt of resins, 6000 Mt of
   PP&A fibers, and 2000 Mt of additives by the end of 2050. Assuming
   consistent use patterns and projecting current global waste management
   trends to 2050 (fig. S7), 9000 Mt of plastic waste will have been
   recycled, 12,000 Mt incinerated, and 12,000 Mt discarded in landfills
   or the natural environment (Fig. 3).

   Fig. 3 Cumulative plastic waste generation and disposal (in million
   metric tons).

   Solid lines show historical data from 1950 to 2015; dashed lines show
   projections of historical trends to 2050.

   Any material flow analysis of this kind requires multiple assumptions
   or simplifications, which are listed in Materials and Methods, and is
   subject to considerable uncertainty; as such, all cumulative results
   are rounded to the nearest 100 Mt. The largest sources of uncertainty
   are the lifetime distributions of the product categories and the
   plastic incineration and recycling rates outside of Europe and the
   United States. Increasing/decreasing the mean lifetimes of all product
   categories by 1 SD changes the cumulative primary plastic waste
   generation (for 1950 to 2015) from 5900 to 4600/6200 Mt or by −4/+5%.
   Increasing/decreasing current global incineration and recycling rates
   by 5%, and adjusting the time trends accordingly, changes the
   cumulative discarded plastic waste from 4900 (for 1950 to 2015) to
   4500/5200 Mt or by −8/+6%.

   The growth of plastics production in the past 65 years has
   substantially outpaced any other manufactured material. The same
   properties that make plastics so versatile in innumerable
   applications—durability and resistance to degradation—make these
   materials difficult or impossible for nature to assimilate. Thus,
   without a well-designed and tailor-made management strategy for
   end-of-life plastics, humans are conducting a singular uncontrolled
   experiment on a global scale, in which billions of metric tons of
   material will accumulate across all major terrestrial and aquatic
   ecosystems on the planet. The relative advantages and disadvantages of
   dematerialization, substitution, reuse, material recycling,
   waste-to-energy, and conversion technologies must be carefully
   considered to design the best solutions to the environmental challenges
   posed by the enormous and sustained global growth in plastics
   production and use.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Plastic production

   The starting point of the plastic production model is global annual
   pure polymer (resin) production data from 1950 to 2015, published by
   the Plastics Europe Market Research Group, and global annual fiber
   production data from 1970 to 2015 published by The Fiber Year and
   Tecnon OrbiChem (table S1). The resin data closely follow a
   second-order polynomial time trend, which generated a fit of R^2 =
   0.9968. The fiber data closely follow a third-order polynomial time
   trend, which generated a fit of R^2 = 0.9934. Global breakdowns of
   total production by polymer type and industrial use sector were derived
   from annual market and polymer data for North America, Europe, China,
   and India (table S2) (12, 13, 19–24). U.S. and European data are
   available for 2002 to 2014. Polymer type and industrial use sector
   breakdowns of polymer production are similar across countries and
   regions.

   Global additives production data, which are not publicly available,
   were acquired from market research companies and cross-checked for
   consistency (table S3) (17, 18). Additives data are available for 2000
   to 2014. Polymer type and industrial use sector breakdowns of polymer
   production and the additives to polymer fraction were both stable over
   the time period for which data are available and thus assumed constant
   throughout the modeling period of 1950–2015. Any errors in the early
   decades were mitigated by the lower production rates in those years.
   Additives data were organized by additive type and industrial use
   sector and integrated with the polymer data. P[i] (t) denotes the
   amount of primary plastics (that is, polymers plus additives) produced
   in year t and used in sector i (fig. S1).

Plastic waste generation and fate

   Plastics use was characterized by discretized log-normal distributions,
   LTD[i] (j), which denotes the fraction of plastics in industrial use
   sector i used for j years (Fig. 1). Mean values and SDs were gathered
   from published literature (table S4) (22, 25–29). Product lifetimes may
   vary significantly across economies and also across demographic groups,
   which is why distributions were used and sensitivity analysis was
   conducted with regard to mean product lifetimes. The total amount of
   primary plastic waste generated in year t was calculated as PW (t) =
   Embedded Image Embedded Image (figs. S3 and S4). Secondary plastic
   waste generated in year t was calculated as the fraction of total
   plastic waste that was recycled k years ago, SW (t) = [PW (t − k) + SW
   (t − k)][RR (t − k)], where k is the average use time of secondary
   plastics and RR (t − k) is the global recycling rate in year t − k.
   Amounts of plastic waste discarded and incinerated are calculated as
   DW(t) = [PW(t) + SW(t) ∙ DR(t) and IW(t) = [PW(t) + SW(t)] ∙ IR(t),
   with DR(t) and IR(t) being the global discard and incineration rates in
   year t (fig. S5). Cumulative values at time T were calculated as the
   sum over all T − 1950 years of plastics mass production. Examples are
   cumulative primary production Embedded Image Embedded Image and
   cumulative primary plastic waste generation, Embedded Image Embedded
   Image (Fig. 3).

Recycling, incineration, and discard rates

   Time series for resin, that is, nonfiber recycling, incineration, and
   discard rates were collected separately for four world regions: the
   United States, the EU-28 plus Norway and Switzerland, China, and the
   rest of the world. Detailed and comprehensive solid waste management
   data for the United States were published by the U.S. Environmental
   Protection Agency dating back to 1960 (table S7) (34). European data
   were from several reports by PlasticsEurope, which collectively cover
   1996 to 2014 (12, 13, 38). Chinese data were synthesized and reconciled
   from the English version of the China Statistical Yearbook,
   translations of Chinese publications and government reports, and
   additional waste management literature (35, 36, 39–41). Waste
   management for the rest of the world was based on World Bank data (37).
   Time series for global recycling, incineration, and discard rates (fig.
   S5) were derived by adding the rates of the four regions weighted by
   their relative contribution to global plastic waste generation. In many
   world regions, waste management data were sparse and of poor quality.
   For this reason, sensitivity analysis with regard to waste management
   rates was conducted.

   The resulting global nonfiber recycling rate increased at a constant
   0.7% per annum (p.a.) between 1990 and 2014. If this linear trend is
   assumed to continue, the global recycling rate would reach 44% in 2050.
   The global nonfiber incineration rate has grown more unevenly but, on
   average, increased 0.7% p.a. between 1980 and 2014. Assuming an annual
   increase of 0.7% between 2014 and 2050 yielded a global incineration
   rate of 50% by 2050. With those two assumptions, global discard rate
   would decrease from 58% in 2014 to 6% in 2050 (fig. S7). The dashed
   lines in Fig. 3 are based on those assumptions and therefore simply
   forward projections of historical global trends and should not be
   mistaken for a prediction or forecast. There is currently no
   significant recycling of synthetic fibers. It was thus assumed that
   end-of-life textiles are incinerated and discarded together with all
   other municipal solid waste.
