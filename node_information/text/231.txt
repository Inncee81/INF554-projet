   Syria

Raqqa is in ruins like a modern Dresden. This is not 'precision bombing'

   Kate Allen

   Thousands of Syrians are dead and their city devastated. How dare the
   US, UK and French militaries speak of ‘surgical strikes’?

   From Kosovo to Iraq and Syria, the US and its military allies have for
   years told a tale of “precision bombing” and “surgical strikes”. It was
   a lie then and it’s a lie now. When huge numbers of bombs and missiles
   are unleashed on densely populated cities like Mosul or Raqqa,
   civilians are killed in their hundreds – possibly thousands. But still,
   the myth of precision and “meticulous processes” persists. Not least
   because militaries like our own refuse to even go back to the cities
   they’ve bombed, and refuse to acknowledge deaths unless presented with
   irrefutable evidence from the likes of Amnesty.

   Last week I did what UK, US and French military officials refuse to do:
   I went to Raqqa to see for myself what has happened to this city as a
   result of mass bombardments by the US-led coalition between June and
   October 2017.

     The coalition has refused to send investigators into Raqqa to
     establish the truth of its boast about 'precision'

   Never before have I seen a city so completely devastated. Not just in
   one district area, but almost entirely. Think Dresden and you’d be
   close. Street after street of windowless, hollowed-out buildings. Miles
   of rubble. Piles of twisted metal. Utter ruin. There has been no
   assistance for residents desperate to rebuild, and entire families are
   reduced to living in bombed-out husks of buildings. Meanwhile, many
   children spend all day scavenging in the rubble for bits of steel and
   plastic they can sell so as to buy food. They risk injury and death
   from unsafe buildings and uncleared landmines.

   Among those I met in this ruined city was Mohamed, a 28-year-old
   carpenter who cares for his younger brother, Rabi’a, who is now
   paralysed after a coalition airstrike destroyed the building where his
   family was sheltering in October 2017. Most of his family were killed.
   Mohamed lost his wife, two children (the youngest of whom was 11 days
   old), his parents, his sister, her husband and their four children.
   With his family as devastated as the city he still inhabits, Mohamed
   has devoted himself to looking after his brother. It’s heartbreaking,
   tragic and deeply moving.

   The battle to oust Islamic State from Raqqa followed the modern US
   military playbook. A massive aerial assault conducted with willing
   military powers (here, the UK and France); zero use of ground troops;
   and a reliance on proxy fighters at street level (here, the Kurdish-led
   Syrian Democratic Forces militia). The bombardment was immense. For
   four months the coalition pounded the city into the ground – with
   thousands of airstrikes (215 from the UK, says the MoD) and 30,000 US
   artillery rounds. Never mind that artillery is notoriously imprecise
   and should not be used in heavily populated areas (such use is
   “indiscriminate” in international legal parlance), the coalition fired
   artillery round after artillery round into residential areas for four
   solid months. In fact, as US forces themselves boasted, more artillery
   was fired into the streets, squares and homes of downtown Raqqa than
   has been fired in any conflict in the world since Vietnam.

   ‘More than 11,000 buildings are uninhabitable and Raqqa is widely
   considered the most-destroyed city of modern times.’

   As I saw for myself, the results are predictably apocalyptic; 80% of
   the city has been reduced to ruins. More than 11,000 buildings are
   uninhabitable and Raqqa is widely considered the most-destroyed city of
   modern times.

   On top of this lethally irresponsible behaviour, the coalition has
   refused to send investigators into the ruined city to establish the
   truth of its boast about “precision”. It has refused to set up a
   compensation fund for those maimed or bereaved by its handiwork. And –
   perhaps most worryingly of all – it has refused to even try to learn
   lessons from this latest exercise in mass bombing without
   responsibility.

   Recently, Amnesty and Airwars presented the UK, US and French
   authorities with detailed evidence from our own painstaking
   on-the-ground investigation showing that at least 1,600 civilians in
   Raqqa were killed by the coalition’s aerial attacks, 10 times more than
   previously acknowledged. Collating huge data streams from
   investigations spanning almost two years and including multiple visits
   to Raqqa, we built a database of the victims, with names for more than
   1,000 of the dead.

   For the last two years, the coalition’s responses have been a mix of
   denial, attacks on the messenger and grudging acknowledgement of a
   small number of deaths when presented with irrefutable evidence.

We lost faith in joint efforts to halt wars. Result? Ask Syria...

   Last year, after Amnesty published a 70-page report based on 42 site
   visits in Raqqa and interviews with 112 beleaguered Raqqa residents,
   then defence secretary Gavin Williamson responded not with alarm at the
   report’s findings but with a broadside against Amnesty from the House
   of Commons despatch box. Our report was “deeply disappointing” and
   “disgraceful”. We needed to recognise the “amazing professionalism of
   our Royal Air Force”. Flag-waving rather than dealing with the
   unpalatable facts – this was yet another aggressive denial from a
   government increasingly unwilling to hold its own military forces to
   account.

   Last week, Willamson’s successor Penny Mordaunt signalled that the UK
   would in future go even further in its refusal to deal with alleged war
   crimes committed by UK forces overseas.

   The fact that Isis fighters terrorised and effectively held hostage
   vast populations in Syria and Iraq doesn’t justify the coalition in
   indiscriminate bombing campaigns. Our armed forces are supposed to be
   better than that. If they are not, it is largely because our
   politicians and top brass continue to wave their flags and hide behind
   the lie of precision.

   exhibition, War in Raqqa: Rhetoric versus Reality, based on Amnesty’s
   Raqqa research, is at the Architectural Association until 30 May

Argentina's women joined across South America in marches against violence

   The crowd of women packed into the historic square of Plaza de Mayo in
   downtown Buenos Aires under the freezing rain was so vast that some had
   to close their umbrellas to all fit together. “Machismo Kills,” read
   the hand-painted sign held aloft by one young woman.

   Tens of thousands of women marched here on Wednesday to protest the
   growing problem of violence against women in Argentina, a problem so
   prevalent that the country sanctioned a law four years ago legally
   defining as “femicide” cases of domestic violence, so-called “honour”
   killings and other categories of hate crimes against women.

   The Buenos Aires march was matched by others across Argentina and other
   South American countries, after women’s groups called for solidarity
   via social media under the hashtags #NiUnaMenos (“Not one less”,
   meaning not one more woman lost to male violence) and #BlackWednesday.

   “This is a march against femicide,” supreme court judge Elena Highton
   de
   Nolasco told the press on the eve of the march. “Cases of femicide are
   growing in number, they are becoming more violent, more perverse – we
   even
   had the news today that there have been 19 femicides in the last 18
   days.”

   “Walking home I want to feel free, not brave,” read another sign by one
   of the marchers on Wednesday.

   “I came because they are killing women who could be my sisters, my
   friends,” said one young marcher.

   Similar marches were held in all of Argentina’s main cities, while the
   Ni Una Menos movement transcended the country’s borders. Demonstrations
   also took place in Mexico, El Salvador, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay and
   Uruguay.

   The protest was prompted by the abduction of Lucía Pérez, a schoolgirl
   who was drugged, raped and tortured earlier this month in the coastal
   city of Mar del Plata.

   The cruelty of her attack was such that Pérez suffered a cardiac
   arrest, according to prosecutor María Isabel Sánchez, who described it
   as “an act of inhuman sexual aggression”.

   Following their assault, the assailants washed the 16-year-old in an
   attempt to erase forensic evidence and took her to a nearby hospital,
   where she died shortly after arrival from internal injuries sustained
   during her rape.

   “I know it’s not very professional to say this, but I’m a mother and a
   woman, and though I’ve seen thousands of cases in my career, I’ve never
   seen anything like this,” prosecutor Sánchez told local media.

   But Pérez’s murder is just the latest in a harrowing sequence of
   “femicides”, crimes usually committed by husbands, boyfriends, family
   members or acquaintances of the victim. In more than one case, the
   woman has been set on fire by her partner.

   Hundreds of people took part in the march in Santiago, Chile.

   The unrelenting series of killings led Michelle Bachelet, president of
   neighbouring Chile, to post a video on Twitter saying that similar
   cases of
   violence in her own country “have led me to join Ni Una Menos, the
   social
   movement born in Argentina, which expresses the frustration felt by our
   own
   compatriots at the cases of violence against women and girls”.

   Every 30 hours in Argentina a woman is killed in such crimes, according
   to statistics kept by La Casa del Encuentro, an NGO that helps female
   victims of violence.

Britain and the US must stop fuelling the bloody Saudi war on Yemen

   Patrick Wilcken
   From Germany to Canada, governments are finally waking up to the
   catastrophe in Yemen. Saudi’s remaining allies are part of the problem

   The end of this week marks three tragedy-filled years for the people of
   Yemen, who have suffered from the Saudi-led military coalition’s
   devastating – and often indiscriminate – bombing of their country.
   Fleets of fighter jets, the bulk from Saudi Arabia itself, have wreaked
   havoc on an impoverished country, with thousands of airstrikes on
   targets including hospitals, markets, homes, factories and funeral
   halls.

   Thousands of civilians have been killed, thousands more horribly
   injured. Collapsed infrastructure, coupled with a partial blockade,
   have deprived most of the population of clean water and proper
   healthcare, unleashing the worst cholera outbreak in modern history.

   Despite all this, western countries, led by the US and the UK, have
   supplied the Saudi-led coalition with huge amounts of advanced military
   equipment, facilitating a military campaign characterised by repeated
   violations of international humanitarian law, including possible war
   crimes.

Nearly half of US arms exports go to the Middle East

   This conflict has revealed in the starkest possible terms the real cost
   of the lucrative global arms trade, not to mention the challenge of
   implementing the UN arms trade treaty. Beyond the US and the UK, many
   other countries – including France, Spain and Italy – profess their
   support for human rights and adherence to the treaty while similarly
   lavishing hi-tech weaponry on the Saudi coalition.

   However, on this grim anniversary for Yemen there are glimmers of hope.
   Across the world vocal criticism from campaigners, journalists and,
   crucially, some politicians has begun to bear fruit. In recent months,
   under growing public pressure, a host of European countries have
   suspended arms transfers to the Saudi coalition. In other countries
   where arms exports have continued, they are coming under intense
   scrutiny, with court challenges and growing criticism from
   parliamentarians and the wider public.

   It’s just possible the tide may be turning.

   In Greece, there was a storm of protest in December when news emerged
   of a deal to send 300,000 tank shells to Saudi Arabia. Amid mounting
   pressure, led by Amnesty Greece, a parliamentary committee broke with
   precedent and cancelled the deal.

   UN calls for more aid to avoid largest humanitarian crisis in 70 years

   In Finland, when images surfaced in January of the United Arab
   Emirates, a key Saudi coalition member, using a Finnish-made Patria
   armoured vehicle for combat operations in Yemen, there was public
   uproar. News that Finland had granted a licence for spare Patria parts
   prompted most candidates in the recent Finnish elections – including
   the president – to speak out about arming the UAE. Norway announced in
   the same month that it was suspending exports of lethal military goods
   to the UAE (it had already stopped supplying Saudi Arabia), citing the
   risk of misuse in Yemen. Austria, the Netherlands and Belgium’s Flemish
   region have repeatedly denied licences for arms sales to Saudi Arabia.

   The really big news, though, was the decision by Germany’s incoming
   coalition to suspend future licences for arms transfers to countries
   directly engaged in the Yemen conflict. After years of concerted
   pressure from civil society, journalists and some key politicians, one
   of the world’s major arms manufacturers has finally drawn the line. It
   remains to be seen how robust this stance will be – in the past arms
   suspensions have often been short-lived and reversed when the pressure
   abates – and, crucially, goods under current deals will still be
   shipped. But it’s another sign that opponents of these reckless arms
   sales are beginning to gain traction.

   Meanwhile, pressure is growing elsewhere as well.

   In the UK, public opinion and all opposition parties support an end to
   arming Saudi Arabia. Much of the outcry over Mohammed bin Salman’s
   recent visit to London focused on this. Dismayed at the government’s
   unwillingness to halt its vast arms sales to Saudi Arabia, campaigners
   took the UK to court, arguing that the government breached its own –
   and international – laws. It is disappointing that their case was lost
   (the government won on the grounds that its licensing decisions were
   “rational” given the evidence being assessed, notwithstanding that much
   of it had been provided by the Saudis themselves), but efforts are
   under way to appeal.

   In the US, impassioned speeches in the Senate accompanied a vote last
   June to block the transfer of $510m of precision-guided munitions and
   related services to Riyadh. The vote was lost by an unprecedentedly
   narrow margin of 47-53. Meanwhile, a new Senate resolution invoking the
   1973 War Powers Act seeks to remove US logistical and intelligence
   support for the Saudi-led coalition’s Yemen campaign on the basis that
   it amounts to US involvement in a war never authorised by Congress.

Why is Saudi Arabia in Yemen and what does it mean for Britain?

   And in Canada, France, Italy and Spain we are seeing a flurry of
   challenges to arms supplies to the coalition – including court cases,
   activism and intense public debate.

   A growing legal and moral quandary now faces European supplier
   countries that still pour weapons into the bloody conflict. Under the
   UN arms trade treaty, they have an obligation to halt the supply of
   weapons if these are likely to be used for serious violations of
   international human rights or humanitarian law. The US, as a signatory,
   has pledged not to undermine the treaty’s object and purpose, which
   includes “reducing human suffering” – a commitment mocked by the
   current desperate situation on the ground in Yemen.

   As Yemen enters another gruelling year of hunger, disease and war, with
   more than 20 million of its people now in need of humanitarian aid, the
   moral and legal bankruptcy of western support for the Saudi-led
   coalition has never been clearer.

   A growing number of countries have recognised the risk of ever-greater
   complicity in the mounting violations and likely war crimes being
   committed in Yemen. It’s time for the Saudi coalition’s remaining arms
   suppliers to follow suit and end their Faustian pact over weapons and
   Yemen.

Brazil officials failed to act after warning of 'fire day’ in Amazon,
prosecutors say

   Investigation into why environment agency ignored warnings that farmers
   and land-grabbers were planning day of coordinated fires

   Drone footage reveals devastation from Amazon fires – video

   Brazilian environmental officials and federal prosecutors say they sent
   a warning that farmers and land-grabbers in the Amazon were planning a
   day of coordinated fires on 10 August to send a message to far-right
   president Jair Bolsonaro, but authorities failed to act.

   Wildfires and burning deforested land are common during the Amazon’s
   dry seasons but peaked this month to more than 26,000 – the highest
   August figure since 2010. The environmental disaster has taken on
   international dimensions and overshadowed the G7 meeting in Biarritz.

   Federal prosecutors in the Amazon state of Pará have now launched an
   investigation after revealing that they warned Brazil’s environment
   agency Ibama that a “fire day” demonstration was being planned around
   the town of Novo Progresso.

   The prosecutors noted that the local Folha do Progresso news site had
   reported on plans for the fire day 5 August. “We need to show the
   president that we want to work” one local farmer told the website,
   adding that the only way to clear land for pasture was by felling trees
   and burning them.

   But Ibama did not reply to the warnings until two days after the
   protests began, when it said that its operations had been hampered
   because police support had been withdrawn, putting their teams at risk
   in a region where they already face threats.

   “It was a considerable failure,” prosecutor Paulo Moreira Oliveira told
   the Guardian. “There should have been immediate action to confront the
   risk of these fires.”

   A separate investigation is examining the rise in deforestation on
   public land in Pará and whether public bodies and authorities could be
   responsible. Moreira Oliveira said that Ibama has imposed fewer fines
   for deforestation in Pará even though forest clearance has increased
   since Bolsonaro took office.

   Two environment officials with experience in the region told the
   Guardian they also knew about the fire day beforehand. One official at
   the Chico Mendes Institute in Pará – which, like Ibama, is part of the
   ministry of the environment – said officials had asked bosses in
   Brasília for help, but requests for reinforcements were ignored.

   “I know support was requested for an emergency plan, but it was not
   answered,” the official said. Both spoke anonymously because the
   government has banned environment officials from talking to media.

   Brazil’s prosecutor-general Raquel Dodge said on Monday that there was
   a “suspicion of orchestrated action,” the G1 news site reported.

Brazilian Amazon deforestation surges to break August records

   Bolsonaro has repeatedly attacked Ibama for running a “fines industry”
   and vowed to open up the Amazon for development.

   He first blamed the fires on NGOs but provided no evidence, then
   conceded that farmers were also setting land on fire to increase
   productive areas and called on them to stop.

   On Sunday, Brazil’s justice minister Sergio Moro tweeted that Bolsonaro
   had asked for a “rigorous investigation” and said federal police had
   been activated, after environment minister Ricardo Salles tweeted an
   article from the Globo Rural site about the “fire day”.

   The site reported that about 70 rural farmers, land grabbers and
   businessmen Novo Progresso and Altamira coordinated ‘fire day’ on the
   margins of the BR-163, a highway which leads through heavily deforested
   areas.

   “These people are Bolsonaro’s electoral base,” said another environment
   official who has worked in the area. “The last thing they want to know
   about is protecting the Amazon.”

   On Monday, the leader of a farmers’ union in Novo Progresso denied that
   there had been a plan for the fire day. “We have no knowledge of this.
   If there was anything like that, it was an isolated act,” Agamenon
   Menezes told the Agência Brasil news agency.

   The Brazilian environment ministry did not respond to a request for
   comment.

Raqqa is in ruins like a modern Dresden. This is not 'precision bombing'

   Kate Allen

   Thousands of Syrians are dead and their city devastated. How dare the
   US, UK and French militaries speak of ‘surgical strikes’?

   From Kosovo to Iraq and Syria, the US and its military allies have for
   years told a tale of “precision bombing” and “surgical strikes”. It was
   a lie then and it’s a lie now. When huge numbers of bombs and missiles
   are unleashed on densely populated cities like Mosul or Raqqa,
   civilians are killed in their hundreds – possibly thousands. But still,
   the myth of precision and “meticulous processes” persists. Not least
   because militaries like our own refuse to even go back to the cities
   they’ve bombed, and refuse to acknowledge deaths unless presented with
   irrefutable evidence from the likes of Amnesty.

   Last week I did what UK, US and French military officials refuse to do:
   I went to Raqqa to see for myself what has happened to this city as a
   result of mass bombardments by the US-led coalition between June and
   October 2017.

     The coalition has refused to send investigators into Raqqa to
     establish the truth of its boast about 'precision'

   Never before have I seen a city so completely devastated. Not just in
   one district area, but almost entirely. Think Dresden and you’d be
   close. Street after street of windowless, hollowed-out buildings. Miles
   of rubble. Piles of twisted metal. Utter ruin. There has been no
   assistance for residents desperate to rebuild, and entire families are
   reduced to living in bombed-out husks of buildings. Meanwhile, many
   children spend all day scavenging in the rubble for bits of steel and
   plastic they can sell so as to buy food. They risk injury and death
   from unsafe buildings and uncleared landmines.

   Among those I met in this ruined city was Mohamed, a 28-year-old
   carpenter who cares for his younger brother, Rabi’a, who is now
   paralysed after a coalition airstrike destroyed the building where his
   family was sheltering in October 2017. Most of his family were killed.
   Mohamed lost his wife, two children (the youngest of whom was 11 days
   old), his parents, his sister, her husband and their four children.
   With his family as devastated as the city he still inhabits, Mohamed
   has devoted himself to looking after his brother. It’s heartbreaking,
   tragic and deeply moving.

   The battle to oust Islamic State from Raqqa followed the modern US
   military playbook. A massive aerial assault conducted with willing
   military powers (here, the UK and France); zero use of ground troops;
   and a reliance on proxy fighters at street level (here, the Kurdish-led
   Syrian Democratic Forces militia). The bombardment was immense. For
   four months the coalition pounded the city into the ground – with
   thousands of airstrikes (215 from the UK, says the MoD) and 30,000 US
   artillery rounds. Never mind that artillery is notoriously imprecise
   and should not be used in heavily populated areas (such use is
   “indiscriminate” in international legal parlance), the coalition fired
   artillery round after artillery round into residential areas for four
   solid months. In fact, as US forces themselves boasted, more artillery
   was fired into the streets, squares and homes of downtown Raqqa than
   has been fired in any conflict in the world since Vietnam.

   ‘More than 11,000 buildings are uninhabitable and Raqqa is widely
   considered the most-destroyed city of modern times.’

   As I saw for myself, the results are predictably apocalyptic; 80% of
   the city has been reduced to ruins. More than 11,000 buildings are
   uninhabitable and Raqqa is widely considered the most-destroyed city of
   modern times.

   On top of this lethally irresponsible behaviour, the coalition has
   refused to send investigators into the ruined city to establish the
   truth of its boast about “precision”. It has refused to set up a
   compensation fund for those maimed or bereaved by its handiwork. And –
   perhaps most worryingly of all – it has refused to even try to learn
   lessons from this latest exercise in mass bombing without
   responsibility.

   Recently, Amnesty and Airwars presented the UK, US and French
   authorities with detailed evidence from our own painstaking
   on-the-ground investigation showing that at least 1,600 civilians in
   Raqqa were killed by the coalition’s aerial attacks, 10 times more than
   previously acknowledged. Collating huge data streams from
   investigations spanning almost two years and including multiple visits
   to Raqqa, we built a database of the victims, with names for more than
   1,000 of the dead.

   For the last two years, the coalition’s responses have been a mix of
   denial, attacks on the messenger and grudging acknowledgement of a
   small number of deaths when presented with irrefutable evidence.

We lost faith in joint efforts to halt wars. Result? Ask Syria...

   Last year, after Amnesty published a 70-page report based on 42 site
   visits in Raqqa and interviews with 112 beleaguered Raqqa residents,
   then defence secretary Gavin Williamson responded not with alarm at the
   report’s findings but with a broadside against Amnesty from the House
   of Commons despatch box. Our report was “deeply disappointing” and
   “disgraceful”. We needed to recognise the “amazing professionalism of
   our Royal Air Force”. Flag-waving rather than dealing with the
   unpalatable facts – this was yet another aggressive denial from a
   government increasingly unwilling to hold its own military forces to
   account.

   Last week, Willamson’s successor Penny Mordaunt signalled that the UK
   would in future go even further in its refusal to deal with alleged war
   crimes committed by UK forces overseas.

   The fact that Isis fighters terrorised and effectively held hostage
   vast populations in Syria and Iraq doesn’t justify the coalition in
   indiscriminate bombing campaigns. Our armed forces are supposed to be
   better than that. If they are not, it is largely because our
   politicians and top brass continue to wave their flags and hide behind
   the lie of precision.

   exhibition, War in Raqqa: Rhetoric versus Reality, based on Amnesty’s
   Raqqa research, is at the Architectural Association until 30 May

Argentina's women joined across South America in marches against violence

   Ni Una Menos demonstrations spurred by rape and killing of 16-year-old
   Lucía Pérez as thousands of protesters call for action on crimes
   against women

   The crowd of women packed into the historic square of Plaza de Mayo in
   downtown Buenos Aires under the freezing rain was so vast that some had
   to close their umbrellas to all fit together. “Machismo Kills,” read
   the hand-painted sign held aloft by one young woman.

   Tens of thousands of women marched here on Wednesday to protest the
   growing problem of violence against women in Argentina, a problem so
   prevalent that the country sanctioned a law four years ago legally
   defining as “femicide” cases of domestic violence, so-called “honour”
   killings and other categories of hate crimes against women.

   The Buenos Aires march was matched by others across Argentina and other
   South American countries, after women’s groups called for solidarity
   via social media under the hashtags #NiUnaMenos (“Not one less”,
   meaning not one more woman lost to male violence) and #BlackWednesday.

   “This is a march against femicide,” supreme court judge Elena Highton
   de
   Nolasco told the press on the eve of the march. “Cases of femicide are
   growing in number, they are becoming more violent, more perverse – we
   even
   had the news today that there have been 19 femicides in the last 18
   days.”

   “Walking home I want to feel free, not brave,” read another sign by one
   of the marchers on Wednesday.

   “I came because they are killing women who could be my sisters, my
   friends,” said one young marcher.

   Similar marches were held in all of Argentina’s main cities, while the
   Ni Una Menos movement transcended the country’s borders. Demonstrations
   also took place in Mexico, El Salvador, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay and
   Uruguay.

   The protest was prompted by the abduction of Lucía Pérez, a schoolgirl
   who was drugged, raped and tortured earlier this month in the coastal
   city of Mar del Plata.

   The cruelty of her attack was such that Pérez suffered a cardiac
   arrest, according to prosecutor María Isabel Sánchez, who described it
   as “an act of inhuman sexual aggression”.

   Following their assault, the assailants washed the 16-year-old in an
   attempt to erase forensic evidence and took her to a nearby hospital,
   where she died shortly after arrival from internal injuries sustained
   during her rape.

   “I know it’s not very professional to say this, but I’m a mother and a
   woman, and though I’ve seen thousands of cases in my career, I’ve never
   seen anything like this,” prosecutor Sánchez told local media.

   But Pérez’s murder is just the latest in a harrowing sequence of
   “femicides”, crimes usually committed by husbands, boyfriends, family
   members or acquaintances of the victim. In more than one case, the
   woman has been set on fire by her partner.

   Hundreds of people took part in the march in Santiago, Chile.

   The unrelenting series of killings led Michelle Bachelet, president of
   neighbouring Chile, to post a video on Twitter saying that similar
   cases of
   violence in her own country “have led me to join Ni Una Menos, the
   social
   movement born in Argentina, which expresses the frustration felt by our
   own
   compatriots at the cases of violence against women and girls”.

   Every 30 hours in Argentina a woman is killed in such crimes, according
   to statistics kept by La Casa del Encuentro, an NGO that helps female
   victims of violence.

Britain and the US must stop fuelling the bloody Saudi war on Yemen

   Patrick Wilcken
   From Germany to Canada, governments are finally waking up to the
   catastrophe in Yemen. Saudi’s remaining allies are part of the problem

   The end of this week marks three tragedy-filled years for the people of
   Yemen, who have suffered from the Saudi-led military coalition’s
   devastating – and often indiscriminate – bombing of their country.
   Fleets of fighter jets, the bulk from Saudi Arabia itself, have wreaked
   havoc on an impoverished country, with thousands of airstrikes on
   targets including hospitals, markets, homes, factories and funeral
   halls.

   Thousands of civilians have been killed, thousands more horribly
   injured. Collapsed infrastructure, coupled with a partial blockade,
   have deprived most of the population of clean water and proper
   healthcare, unleashing the worst cholera outbreak in modern history.

   Despite all this, western countries, led by the US and the UK, have
   supplied the Saudi-led coalition with huge amounts of advanced military
   equipment, facilitating a military campaign characterised by repeated
   violations of international humanitarian law, including possible war
   crimes.

Nearly half of US arms exports go to the Middle East

   This conflict has revealed in the starkest possible terms the real cost
   of the lucrative global arms trade, not to mention the challenge of
   implementing the UN arms trade treaty. Beyond the US and the UK, many
   other countries – including France, Spain and Italy – profess their
   support for human rights and adherence to the treaty while similarly
   lavishing hi-tech weaponry on the Saudi coalition.

   However, on this grim anniversary for Yemen there are glimmers of hope.
   Across the world vocal criticism from campaigners, journalists and,
   crucially, some politicians has begun to bear fruit. In recent months,
   under growing public pressure, a host of European countries have
   suspended arms transfers to the Saudi coalition. In other countries
   where arms exports have continued, they are coming under intense
   scrutiny, with court challenges and growing criticism from
   parliamentarians and the wider public.

   It’s just possible the tide may be turning.

   In Greece, there was a storm of protest in December when news emerged
   of a deal to send 300,000 tank shells to Saudi Arabia. Amid mounting
   pressure, led by Amnesty Greece, a parliamentary committee broke with
   precedent and cancelled the deal.

   UN calls for more aid to avoid largest humanitarian crisis in 70 years

   In Finland, when images surfaced in January of the United Arab
   Emirates, a key Saudi coalition member, using a Finnish-made Patria
   armoured vehicle for combat operations in Yemen, there was public
   uproar. News that Finland had granted a licence for spare Patria parts
   prompted most candidates in the recent Finnish elections – including
   the president – to speak out about arming the UAE. Norway announced in
   the same month that it was suspending exports of lethal military goods
   to the UAE (it had already stopped supplying Saudi Arabia), citing the
   risk of misuse in Yemen. Austria, the Netherlands and Belgium’s Flemish
   region have repeatedly denied licences for arms sales to Saudi Arabia.

   The really big news, though, was the decision by Germany’s incoming
   coalition to suspend future licences for arms transfers to countries
   directly engaged in the Yemen conflict. After years of concerted
   pressure from civil society, journalists and some key politicians, one
   of the world’s major arms manufacturers has finally drawn the line. It
   remains to be seen how robust this stance will be – in the past arms
   suspensions have often been short-lived and reversed when the pressure
   abates – and, crucially, goods under current deals will still be
   shipped. But it’s another sign that opponents of these reckless arms
   sales are beginning to gain traction.

   Meanwhile, pressure is growing elsewhere as well.

   In the UK, public opinion and all opposition parties support an end to
   arming Saudi Arabia. Much of the outcry over Mohammed bin Salman’s
   recent visit to London focused on this. Dismayed at the government’s
   unwillingness to halt its vast arms sales to Saudi Arabia, campaigners
   took the UK to court, arguing that the government breached its own –
   and international – laws. It is disappointing that their case was lost
   (the government won on the grounds that its licensing decisions were
   “rational” given the evidence being assessed, notwithstanding that much
   of it had been provided by the Saudis themselves), but efforts are
   under way to appeal.

   In the US, impassioned speeches in the Senate accompanied a vote last
   June to block the transfer of $510m of precision-guided munitions and
   related services to Riyadh. The vote was lost by an unprecedentedly
   narrow margin of 47-53. Meanwhile, a new Senate resolution invoking the
   1973 War Powers Act seeks to remove US logistical and intelligence
   support for the Saudi-led coalition’s Yemen campaign on the basis that
   it amounts to US involvement in a war never authorised by Congress.

Why is Saudi Arabia in Yemen and what does it mean for Britain?

   And in Canada, France, Italy and Spain we are seeing a flurry of
   challenges to arms supplies to the coalition – including court cases,
   activism and intense public debate.

   A growing legal and moral quandary now faces European supplier
   countries that still pour weapons into the bloody conflict. Under the
   UN arms trade treaty, they have an obligation to halt the supply of
   weapons if these are likely to be used for serious violations of
   international human rights or humanitarian law. The US, as a signatory,
   has pledged not to undermine the treaty’s object and purpose, which
   includes “reducing human suffering” – a commitment mocked by the
   current desperate situation on the ground in Yemen.

   As Yemen enters another gruelling year of hunger, disease and war, with
   more than 20 million of its people now in need of humanitarian aid, the
   moral and legal bankruptcy of western support for the Saudi-led
   coalition has never been clearer.

   A growing number of countries have recognised the risk of ever-greater
   complicity in the mounting violations and likely war crimes being
   committed in Yemen. It’s time for the Saudi coalition’s remaining arms
   suppliers to follow suit and end their Faustian pact over weapons and
   Yemen.

Brazil officials failed to act after warning of 'fire day’ in Amazon,
prosecutors say

   Investigation into why environment agency ignored warnings that farmers
   and land-grabbers were planning day of coordinated fires

   Drone footage reveals devastation from Amazon fires – video

   Brazilian environmental officials and federal prosecutors say they sent
   a warning that farmers and land-grabbers in the Amazon were planning a
   day of coordinated fires on 10 August to send a message to far-right
   president Jair Bolsonaro, but authorities failed to act.

   Wildfires and burning deforested land are common during the Amazon’s
   dry seasons but peaked this month to more than 26,000 – the highest
   August figure since 2010. The environmental disaster has taken on
   international dimensions and overshadowed the G7 meeting in Biarritz.

   Federal prosecutors in the Amazon state of Pará have now launched an
   investigation after revealing that they warned Brazil’s environment
   agency Ibama that a “fire day” demonstration was being planned around
   the town of Novo Progresso.

   The prosecutors noted that the local Folha do Progresso news site had
   reported on plans for the fire day 5 August. “We need to show the
   president that we want to work” one local farmer told the website,
   adding that the only way to clear land for pasture was by felling trees
   and burning them.

   But Ibama did not reply to the warnings until two days after the
   protests began, when it said that its operations had been hampered
   because police support had been withdrawn, putting their teams at risk
   in a region where they already face threats.

   “It was a considerable failure,” prosecutor Paulo Moreira Oliveira told
   the Guardian. “There should have been immediate action to confront the
   risk of these fires.”

   A separate investigation is examining the rise in deforestation on
   public land in Pará and whether public bodies and authorities could be
   responsible. Moreira Oliveira said that Ibama has imposed fewer fines
   for deforestation in Pará even though forest clearance has increased
   since Bolsonaro took office.

   Two environment officials with experience in the region told the
   Guardian they also knew about the fire day beforehand. One official at
   the Chico Mendes Institute in Pará – which, like Ibama, is part of the
   ministry of the environment – said officials had asked bosses in
   Brasília for help, but requests for reinforcements were ignored.

   “I know support was requested for an emergency plan, but it was not
   answered,” the official said. Both spoke anonymously because the
   government has banned environment officials from talking to media.

   Brazil’s prosecutor-general Raquel Dodge said on Monday that there was
   a “suspicion of orchestrated action,” the G1 news site reported.

Brazilian Amazon deforestation surges to break August records

   Bolsonaro has repeatedly attacked Ibama for running a “fines industry”
   and vowed to open up the Amazon for development.

   He first blamed the fires on NGOs but provided no evidence, then
   conceded that farmers were also setting land on fire to increase
   productive areas and called on them to stop.

   On Sunday, Brazil’s justice minister Sergio Moro tweeted that Bolsonaro
   had asked for a “rigorous investigation” and said federal police had
   been activated, after environment minister Ricardo Salles tweeted an
   article from the Globo Rural site about the “fire day”.

   The site reported that about 70 rural farmers, land grabbers and
   businessmen Novo Progresso and Altamira coordinated ‘fire day’ on the
   margins of the BR-163, a highway which leads through heavily deforested
   areas.

   “These people are Bolsonaro’s electoral base,” said another environment
   official who has worked in the area. “The last thing they want to know
   about is protecting the Amazon.”

   On Monday, the leader of a farmers’ union in Novo Progresso denied that
   there had been a plan for the fire day. “We have no knowledge of this.
   If there was anything like that, it was an isolated act,” Agamenon
   Menezes told the Agência Brasil news agency.

   The Brazilian environment ministry did not respond to a request for
   comment.
