Huawei announces computing strategy and releases Atlas 900, the world's
fastest AI training cluster

   Sep 18, 2019

   [Shanghai, China, September 18, 2019] At HUAWEI CONNECT 2019, Huawei
   announced its strategy for the computing market and released Atlas 900,
   the world's fastest AI training cluster. A powerhouse of AI computing,
   Atlas 900 will help make AI more readily available for different fields
   of scientific research and business innovation.

   Ken Hu outlines Huawei’s computing strategy in his keynote at HUAWEI
   CONNECT 2019

   "The future of computing is a massive market worth more than two
   trillion US dollars," said Ken Hu, Huawei's Deputy Chairman. "We'll
   keep investing with a strategy that focuses on four key areas. We will
   push the boundaries of architecture, invest in processors for all
   scenarios, keep clear business boundaries, and build an open
   ecosystem."

   Huawei's computing strategy

   The industry's approach to computing is evolving from rule-based to
   statistical models, which are the foundation of machine learning.
   Huawei estimates that in the next five years, statistical computing
   will become the mainstream and AI computing will account for more than
   80% of all computing power used around the world.

   To carve out a place in this market, Huawei's strategy will focus on
   four key areas:
     * Architecture innovation. Last year Huawei launched the Da Vinci
       architecture, an innovative processor architecture designed to
       provide a steady and abundant supply of affordable computing power.
       Huawei will continue to invest in basic research.
     * Investment in all-scenario processors. Huawei has a full lineup of
       processors: Kunpeng processors for general purpose computing,
       Ascend processors for AI, Kirin processors for smart devices, and
       Honghu processors for smart screens.
     * Clear business boundaries. Huawei won't sell its processors
       directly. Instead, it will provide them to its customers in the
       form of cloud services, and to its partners in the form of
       components, prioritizing support for integrated solutions.
     * Building an open ecosystem. In the next five years, Huawei will
       invest another US$1.5 billion in its developer program. The aim is
       to expand the program to support five million developers and enable
       Huawei's worldwide partners to develop the next generation of
       intelligent applications and solutions.

   Atlas 900, the world's fastest AI training cluster

   Building on the technical strengths that Huawei has developed over the
   past decade, Atlas 900 combines the power of thousands of Ascend
   processors. It takes Atlas 900 only 59.8 seconds to train ResNet-50,
   the gold standard for measuring AI training performance. This is 10
   seconds faster than the previous world record.

   Atlas 900 is a powerhouse of AI computing, and it will bring new
   possibilities to different fields of scientific research and business
   innovation – anything from astronomy, weather forecasting, and
   autonomous driving, to oil exploration. Huawei also deployed Atlas 900
   on Huawei Cloud as a cluster service, making extraordinary computing
   power more broadly accessible to its customers across different
   industries. Huawei has offered these services at a great discount to
   universities and scientific research institutes worldwide.

   Gao Wen, a Member of Chinese Academy of Engineering and Director of
   Peng Cheng Lab, also spoke at this year's event. He shared the mission
   and vision of Peng Cheng Lab and how the organization will work with
   Huawei to build China's first evolving AI supercomputing system that
   supports exascale computing. The two companies will work together to
   establish a new generation of platforms for AI basic research and
   innovation.

   Zheng Yelai, President of Huawei's Cloud BU, talked about how AI can be
   applied in different scenarios. Based on Huawei's experience in over
   500 projects across more than 10 industries, Zheng pointed out that
   industry AI is crossing the commercial chasm and becoming the key
   driver for reshaping how companies go digital.

   "This is a new age of exploration," Ken Hu concluded. "An ocean of
   boundless potential is waiting, but just one ship won't cut it. Today
   we launch a thousand ships. Let's work together, seize this historic
   opportunity, and advance intelligence to new heights."

   HUAWEI CONNECT 2019 is an annual flagship event hosted by Huawei for
   the global ICT industry, and is held in Shanghai from September 18 to
   20, 2019. This year’s Conference is themed on "Advance Intelligence"
   and aims to establish an open, cooperative, and shared platform for
   customers and partners to explore new opportunities for an intelligent
   future.

     *

   [Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, October 3, 2019] In a significant step towards
   superior connectivity for Malaysia, Maxis and Huawei Technologies
   Malaysia (Huawei) today signed an agreement for the provisioning of 5G
   network in the country. The signing ceremony was witnessed by Yang Amat
   Berhormat Tun Dr. Mahathir bin Mohamad, the Prime Minister of Malaysia
   at Yayasan Kepimpinan Perdana, Putrajaya.

   Signing the agreement on behalf of Maxis was its Chief Executive
   Officer, Gokhan Ogut, while Huawei was represented by Michael Yuan, its
   Chief Executive Officer.

   Accompanying the Prime Minister at the signing were Yang Berhormat Tuan
   Eddin Syazlee Shith, Deputy Minister of Communication and Multimedia
   and Yang Berusaha Encik Al-Ishsal Ishak, Chairman of the Malaysian
   Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC). Also present at the
   signing were Maxis’ Chairman, Yang Mulia Raja Tan Sri Dato’ Seri Arshad
   bin Raja Tun Uda,  Ryan Ding, Executive Director, CEO of the Carrier
   BG, Huawei and Jeffery Liu, President of South Pacific Region, Huawei.

   Maxis and Huawei Technologies Malaysia sign 5G agreement

   The agreement marks an important milestone in Maxis’ 5G journey as it
   commits to deliver the best 5G innovation to benefit the people and
   businesses in Malaysia. 5G will be the fastest network and far more
   advanced in terms of robustness, latency, peak speed and reliability
   with potential speeds reaching 10Gbps.

   With this agreement, Maxis has committed to work with its long-term
   network partner, Huawei, to launch 5G in Malaysia. As part of the
   agreement, Huawei will be supplying 4G/LTE and 5G radio equipment and
   services. Besides having access to 5G technologies, Maxis will able to
   modernise its existing LTE network to be 5G-ready. Leveraging on
   existing investments and footprint, Maxis will be able to facilitate
   faster rollout of 5G services when spectrum is available.

   Additionally, Maxis will have access to insights, standards, products
   and solutions that would make 5G easier to deploy and operate and
   introduce new use cases in Malaysia. Huawei will also be putting
   together a strong team of experts to support Maxis on a series of
   technical training programmes on planning, operations and maintenance
   of the 5G network.

   Yang Amat Berhormat Tun Dr. Mahathir bin Mohamad, Prime Minister of
   Malaysia, said, “The impact of advanced technologies on our progress as
   a nation is inevitable and we cannot afford to be left behind,
   especially with Industry 4.0 already upon us. There is no doubt that 5G
   will be a key driver to connecting everyone in Malaysia and
   transforming key industries such as manufacturing, agriculture and
   healthcare so that we can remain globally competitive. Collaboration
   between global players and local vendors is important to support a
   thriving technology ecosystem in Malaysia. I am pleased to see Maxis
   and Huawei taking advantage of this environment and supporting the
   growth of Malaysia’s digital economy.”

   YM Raja Tan Sri Dato’ Seri Arshad bin Raja Tun Uda, Chairman of Maxis,
   said, “This is an important moment not just for Maxis, but for everyone
   in Malaysia as we prepare ourselves for an exciting future of next
   generation connectivity. Today’s signing therefore represents
   significant progress in our journey and commitment to accelerate 5G in
   Malaysia. We are pleased to be working with global technology leader
   and our long term partner, Huawei, whose experience, expertise and
   capabilities in 5G complement our ambitions to be Malaysia’s leading
   converged solutions company. We would like to thank the Government for
   its instrumental role in driving the 5G national agenda, and we look
   forward to continue working with the Ministry of Communication and
   Multimedia and MCMC throughout our journey.”

   Ryan Ding, Executive Director, CEO of the Carrier BG, Huawei, said that
   “Malaysia has been making tremendous progress in connecting the
   unconnected and embracing new ICT infrastructure development. With 5G
   technology deployment, we foresee Malaysia will go through a phase of
   rapid digital transformation. 5G technology is expected to accelerate
   the adoption of Internet of Things (IoT), which will be a part of
   implementation of an end-to-end solution that covers the supply chain
   to meet the requirements of building a smart nation. Our vision is
   aligned with the Government of Malaysia in bringing digital to every
   person, home and organisation for a fully connected, intelligent world.
   Maxis has always been at the forefront in introducing new technologies
   to Malaysia. It was the first to bring 4G to the market and continues
   to invest significantly in this area to maintain its 4G network
   leadership in terms of speed, performance and experience, as attested
   by MCMC’s 2018 Network Performance Report as well as independent
   studies. Huawei has supported the deployment of 5G by many operators
   globally. The company brings with them years of expertise and research
   in 5G, having set up a platform for operators and industry partners to
   incubate 5G applications together. Working together for over 10 years,
   Huawei has supported Maxis to become the undisputed network leader in
   the country.”

   Maxis’ 5G journey

   Maxis has long started its 5G journey. Over the last few years, Maxis
   has been assessing the technology and conducting demo trials in its
   test lab. Maxis has been upgrading its transport network to support the
   gigabit speeds and at the same time virtualising its core network
   elements for flexibility and scalability for the capacity demands of
   this technology.

   In February, Maxis and Huawei signed an MoU to cooperate on
   full-fledged 5G trials. Following this, Maxis commenced the first 5G
   live trials in the country, where it recorded close to 3Gbps download
   speeds. Maxis also participated in MCMC’s #5GMalaysia showcase in
   Putrajaya, demonstrating how 5G can enable Government and corporations
   to make informed decisions using the technology. Most recently, Maxis
   and Huawei brought its 5G showcase to Kuching at IDECS 2019.

Huawei announces computing strategy and releases Atlas 900, the world's
fastest AI training cluster

   Sep 18, 2019

   [Shanghai, China, September 18, 2019] At HUAWEI CONNECT 2019, Huawei
   announced its strategy for the computing market and released Atlas 900,
   the world's fastest AI training cluster. A powerhouse of AI computing,
   Atlas 900 will help make AI more readily available for different fields
   of scientific research and business innovation.

   Ken Hu outlines Huawei’s computing strategy in his keynote at HUAWEI
   CONNECT 2019

   "The future of computing is a massive market worth more than two
   trillion US dollars," said Ken Hu, Huawei's Deputy Chairman. "We'll
   keep investing with a strategy that focuses on four key areas. We will
   push the boundaries of architecture, invest in processors for all
   scenarios, keep clear business boundaries, and build an open
   ecosystem."

   Huawei's computing strategy

   The industry's approach to computing is evolving from rule-based to
   statistical models, which are the foundation of machine learning.
   Huawei estimates that in the next five years, statistical computing
   will become the mainstream and AI computing will account for more than
   80% of all computing power used around the world.

   To carve out a place in this market, Huawei's strategy will focus on
   four key areas:
     * Architecture innovation. Last year Huawei launched the Da Vinci
       architecture, an innovative processor architecture designed to
       provide a steady and abundant supply of affordable computing power.
       Huawei will continue to invest in basic research.
     * Investment in all-scenario processors. Huawei has a full lineup of
       processors: Kunpeng processors for general purpose computing,
       Ascend processors for AI, Kirin processors for smart devices, and
       Honghu processors for smart screens.
     * Clear business boundaries. Huawei won't sell its processors
       directly. Instead, it will provide them to its customers in the
       form of cloud services, and to its partners in the form of
       components, prioritizing support for integrated solutions.
     * Building an open ecosystem. In the next five years, Huawei will
       invest another US$1.5 billion in its developer program. The aim is
       to expand the program to support five million developers and enable
       Huawei's worldwide partners to develop the next generation of
       intelligent applications and solutions.

   Atlas 900, the world's fastest AI training cluster

   Building on the technical strengths that Huawei has developed over the
   past decade, Atlas 900 combines the power of thousands of Ascend
   processors. It takes Atlas 900 only 59.8 seconds to train ResNet-50,
   the gold standard for measuring AI training performance. This is 10
   seconds faster than the previous world record.

   Atlas 900 is a powerhouse of AI computing, and it will bring new
   possibilities to different fields of scientific research and business
   innovation – anything from astronomy, weather forecasting, and
   autonomous driving, to oil exploration. Huawei also deployed Atlas 900
   on Huawei Cloud as a cluster service, making extraordinary computing
   power more broadly accessible to its customers across different
   industries. Huawei has offered these services at a great discount to
   universities and scientific research institutes worldwide.

   Gao Wen, a Member of Chinese Academy of Engineering and Director of
   Peng Cheng Lab, also spoke at this year's event. He shared the mission
   and vision of Peng Cheng Lab and how the organization will work with
   Huawei to build China's first evolving AI supercomputing system that
   supports exascale computing. The two companies will work together to
   establish a new generation of platforms for AI basic research and
   innovation.

   Zheng Yelai, President of Huawei's Cloud BU, talked about how AI can be
   applied in different scenarios. Based on Huawei's experience in over
   500 projects across more than 10 industries, Zheng pointed out that
   industry AI is crossing the commercial chasm and becoming the key
   driver for reshaping how companies go digital.

   "This is a new age of exploration," Ken Hu concluded. "An ocean of
   boundless potential is waiting, but just one ship won't cut it. Today
   we launch a thousand ships. Let's work together, seize this historic
   opportunity, and advance intelligence to new heights."

   HUAWEI CONNECT 2019 is an annual flagship event hosted by Huawei for
   the global ICT industry, and is held in Shanghai from September 18 to
   20, 2019. This year’s Conference is themed on "Advance Intelligence"
   and aims to establish an open, cooperative, and shared platform for
   customers and partners to explore new opportunities for an intelligent
   future.

     *

   [Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, October 3, 2019] In a significant step towards
   superior connectivity for Malaysia, Maxis and Huawei Technologies
   Malaysia (Huawei) today signed an agreement for the provisioning of 5G
   network in the country. The signing ceremony was witnessed by Yang Amat
   Berhormat Tun Dr. Mahathir bin Mohamad, the Prime Minister of Malaysia
   at Yayasan Kepimpinan Perdana, Putrajaya.

   Signing the agreement on behalf of Maxis was its Chief Executive
   Officer, Gokhan Ogut, while Huawei was represented by Michael Yuan, its
   Chief Executive Officer.

   Accompanying the Prime Minister at the signing were Yang Berhormat Tuan
   Eddin Syazlee Shith, Deputy Minister of Communication and Multimedia
   and Yang Berusaha Encik Al-Ishsal Ishak, Chairman of the Malaysian
   Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC). Also present at the
   signing were Maxis’ Chairman, Yang Mulia Raja Tan Sri Dato’ Seri Arshad
   bin Raja Tun Uda,  Ryan Ding, Executive Director, CEO of the Carrier
   BG, Huawei and Jeffery Liu, President of South Pacific Region, Huawei.

   Maxis and Huawei Technologies Malaysia sign 5G agreement

   The agreement marks an important milestone in Maxis’ 5G journey as it
   commits to deliver the best 5G innovation to benefit the people and
   businesses in Malaysia. 5G will be the fastest network and far more
   advanced in terms of robustness, latency, peak speed and reliability
   with potential speeds reaching 10Gbps.

   With this agreement, Maxis has committed to work with its long-term
   network partner, Huawei, to launch 5G in Malaysia. As part of the
   agreement, Huawei will be supplying 4G/LTE and 5G radio equipment and
   services. Besides having access to 5G technologies, Maxis will able to
   modernise its existing LTE network to be 5G-ready. Leveraging on
   existing investments and footprint, Maxis will be able to facilitate
   faster rollout of 5G services when spectrum is available.

   Additionally, Maxis will have access to insights, standards, products
   and solutions that would make 5G easier to deploy and operate and
   introduce new use cases in Malaysia. Huawei will also be putting
   together a strong team of experts to support Maxis on a series of
   technical training programmes on planning, operations and maintenance
   of the 5G network.

   Yang Amat Berhormat Tun Dr. Mahathir bin Mohamad, Prime Minister of
   Malaysia, said, “The impact of advanced technologies on our progress as
   a nation is inevitable and we cannot afford to be left behind,
   especially with Industry 4.0 already upon us. There is no doubt that 5G
   will be a key driver to connecting everyone in Malaysia and
   transforming key industries such as manufacturing, agriculture and
   healthcare so that we can remain globally competitive. Collaboration
   between global players and local vendors is important to support a
   thriving technology ecosystem in Malaysia. I am pleased to see Maxis
   and Huawei taking advantage of this environment and supporting the
   growth of Malaysia’s digital economy.”

   YM Raja Tan Sri Dato’ Seri Arshad bin Raja Tun Uda, Chairman of Maxis,
   said, “This is an important moment not just for Maxis, but for everyone
   in Malaysia as we prepare ourselves for an exciting future of next
   generation connectivity. Today’s signing therefore represents
   significant progress in our journey and commitment to accelerate 5G in
   Malaysia. We are pleased to be working with global technology leader
   and our long term partner, Huawei, whose experience, expertise and
   capabilities in 5G complement our ambitions to be Malaysia’s leading
   converged solutions company. We would like to thank the Government for
   its instrumental role in driving the 5G national agenda, and we look
   forward to continue working with the Ministry of Communication and
   Multimedia and MCMC throughout our journey.”

   Ryan Ding, Executive Director, CEO of the Carrier BG, Huawei, said that
   “Malaysia has been making tremendous progress in connecting the
   unconnected and embracing new ICT infrastructure development. With 5G
   technology deployment, we foresee Malaysia will go through a phase of
   rapid digital transformation. 5G technology is expected to accelerate
   the adoption of Internet of Things (IoT), which will be a part of
   implementation of an end-to-end solution that covers the supply chain
   to meet the requirements of building a smart nation. Our vision is
   aligned with the Government of Malaysia in bringing digital to every
   person, home and organisation for a fully connected, intelligent world.
   Maxis has always been at the forefront in introducing new technologies
   to Malaysia. It was the first to bring 4G to the market and continues
   to invest significantly in this area to maintain its 4G network
   leadership in terms of speed, performance and experience, as attested
   by MCMC’s 2018 Network Performance Report as well as independent
   studies. Huawei has supported the deployment of 5G by many operators
   globally. The company brings with them years of expertise and research
   in 5G, having set up a platform for operators and industry partners to
   incubate 5G applications together. Working together for over 10 years,
   Huawei has supported Maxis to become the undisputed network leader in
   the country.”

   Maxis’ 5G journey

   Maxis has long started its 5G journey. Over the last few years, Maxis
   has been assessing the technology and conducting demo trials in its
   test lab. Maxis has been upgrading its transport network to support the
   gigabit speeds and at the same time virtualising its core network
   elements for flexibility and scalability for the capacity demands of
   this technology.

   In February, Maxis and Huawei signed an MoU to cooperate on
   full-fledged 5G trials. Following this, Maxis commenced the first 5G
   live trials in the country, where it recorded close to 3Gbps download
   speeds. Maxis also participated in MCMC’s #5GMalaysia showcase in
   Putrajaya, demonstrating how 5G can enable Government and corporations
   to make informed decisions using the technology. Most recently, Maxis
   and Huawei brought its 5G showcase to Kuching at IDECS 2019.
