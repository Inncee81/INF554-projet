   The Jakarta administration announced on Thursday the 2019 minimum wage,
   which has been set at Rp 3.94 million (US$260), as stated in
   Gubernatorial Regulation No. 114/2018.

   The figure is around 8 percent increase from the current minimum wage
   of Rp 3.6 million.

   The announcement took place simultaneously with other regions across
   the country, as suggested by Manpower Ministerial Regulation No. 7/201
   on the minimum wage.

   In a written statement published on the city’s official website, the
   Jakarta administration also cited its program to improve workers’
   welfare in the city through the Kartu Pekerja, or worker’s card.

   The program is aimed at helping low-income workers to cut their
   expenditure especially on transportation, household needs and
   education.

   In order to get the card, workers whose monthly income is equal to or
   10 percent higher than the minimum wage should submit an application to
   the city administration. The application should include copies of their
   ID card (KTP), family card (KK), tax number (NPWP), a salary slip and
   an official letter from their employer.

   “The application can be submitted to the Manpower Agency or
   sub-agencies or through union representatives,” the statement read.

   Under the program, the card holder will be able to use Transjakarta
   buses for free. The card also provides subsidies for basic household
   needs in city-owned traditional markets and allowances for their
   children’s education.

   The education subsidy ranges from Rp 250,000 per month for an
   elementary school pupil to Rp 1.8 million per semester for older
   students. (vla)
