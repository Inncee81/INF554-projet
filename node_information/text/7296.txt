The House of Gaunt - Lord Voldemort Origins

   alt

   Thank you for believing in this project as a bit insane as we are !

   Some of you have asked us what would be the purpose of the collected
   donations once the 100% have been reached. We answer you in 3 points :

   Incredible sets for the final battle !

   Special effects even more breathtaking !

   A better infrastructure for the post-production and a faster theatrical
   release !

   Obviously, the cumulative donations system (whatever the amount) for
   the compensations is always within the campaign. For example :

   If you have donated 20€, you will have the right to get the film in 4K
   digital version in preview, to the poster (and of course, your name in
   the credits).

   By giving another 20€, you won’t receive the movie twice (even if we
   know that you will adore it and that you will want to see it twice in a
   row !), but the compensation corresponding to a donation of 40€, that
   is to say the Star Pack which contains an invitation to the private
   showing of the movie in Paris with the movie team, followed by a debate
   and also a meeting… Without forgetting the 4K digital version of the
   film, the poster and your name in the credits !

   You are the ambassadors of this ambitious project,

   We are counting on you to keep sharing it !

   The House of Gaunt team.

   alt

   Imbused with esthetics of Harry Potter saga, and freely adapted from
   the book « Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince » written by J.K.
   Rowling, The House of Gaunt is a french (but in english) short-movie
   relating « darkly, violently and realistically » the origins and the
   height of Voldemort.

   Want to see the greatest black mage (played by Maxence Danet-Fauvel)
   like you had never seen him before ? There are still some shots to
   make, your support is essential.

   alt

   (former sponsors, we have sent you an email in which you will find a
   surprise, last September the 23) :

   Two years and a half ago, we launched our first Ulule campaign to begin
   the filming and according to the evolution of the short-movie and the
   related expectations, it was necessary to ensure the project’s quality
   to deploy a second one. Then, we sincerely thought that the proceeds
   would have been enough to finance and close this short-movie that many
   of you are waiting for… Unfortunately, we were not able to finish the
   filming of the whole second part of the short film dedicated to the
   climax of Voldemort.

   Indeed, the last filming session required many financial efforts in
   terms of location, technical equipment or special effects… and we
   preferred favouring the aesthetic quality and the artistic coherence,
   rather than botch certain crucial scenes and to tarnish the universe of
   the saga, or worse, to totally harm the original work…

   15% of the short-movie is all that remains to be filmed ! However, 15%
   corresponding to three days of work and for which we need to rent
   equipment, ensure transports…

   alt

   That is why we are asking for your help one last time to finally end
   the shooting of this short-movie which, as you have noticed and as we
   promise you that it will be… spectacular. If you already had made one
   or more donations, we do not expect you to do it again, but if you
   share this campaign to your friends, family, if you talk about it
   around you, your support would be as precious !

   Optimistic, we have already begun the preparations of this final
   shooting that we expect for the end of October / early November if the
   donations campaign that will end on October the XX is validated. The
   program includes : spells, broom pursuits, fights… we won’t say more
   but we can’t wait to show you !

   This is our last chance to end this short-movie in which you will see
   Voldemort as you have never seen it, to offer you a saga chapter never
   showed in the films. Since the beginning of 2016 when we had started
   the writing of the scenario, we invest all of our energy and passion
   hoping that this short-movie will finally see the light of day. And
   your messages of support are a Felix Felicis flask of everyday. It is a
   project which transports us and we hope that it will be able to
   « port-key-rry » you with us, that you will be proud of you for having
   contributed to its financial, to have brought it out of the shadow !

   These 20 days can change everything, we are counting on you !

   This movie tells the origins of Lord Voldemort, from the meeting
   between his mother, Merope Gaunt, and his father, Tom Jedusor Senior,
   to the height of the biggest dark wizard of all times. Condensed of
   tensions, emotions and sparkles, it raises a new portrait of the Gaunt
   family and of Voldemort, well aged of 30 years. This script, co-written
   by the director Joris FAUCON GRIMAUD and Thomas ROKITA, comes from the
   book « Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince » of J.K. Rowling and it
   is intended to be the most faithful to the author work and its
   universe. Backed by the support which it already received, this short
   movie is carried by a team of cinema lovers also first hour fans of
   Harry Potter universe. We dreamt about filming a movie in this universe
   as long as it be the most professional, and it’s about to happen !

   alt

   We want this adaptation to delight both fans and spectators less
   familiar with this universe, so that short movie is accessible to
   everyone. In order to do this, and despite the budgetary obligations,
   we globally adapt. It’s why we make a fantasy (and pretty horrific)
   thriller : to offer an oppressive, realistic, even violent atmosphere,
   while keeping the spirit of books and movies.

   alt

   The Gaunt family comes from an old line of pureblood wizards, the last
   heirs of Salazar Slytherin, one of the founding members of Hogwarts. If
   it was a wealthy family in the 20’s, its members were more well-known
   for their instability and their pronounced taste for the violence.

   Bob Ogden, the department Head of police of the Ministry of Magic, goes
   to Elvis Gaunt’s with a subpoena for his son, Morfin. Last night, that
   latter cast a spell upon a Muggle. Bob then meets a young woman, Merope
   Gaunt, who looks through the window a Muggle named Tom Jedusor Senior.

   Bob doesn’t know it yet, but the event which is about to happen will be
   decisive for the birth of Voldemort, the darkest Lord of all times.

   alt

   As announced before, we are driven by the ambition to honor this saga
   which lulled our childhood and we want to offer you a result that meets
   your expectations. That is why we are launching a final crowdfunding
   campaign in order to end the shooting of this short-movie (only 15%
   left !). Even if this movie doesn’t have any prospect of profitability,
   and that it will not generate any profit because it is led by a team of
   volunteers, however some costs remains unavoidable (equipment rents,
   special effects…)

   alt

   alt

   Once post-product, we will compete this film in various international
   festivals and we also aim for a theatrical release, in France and
   abroad, before it is posted on YouTube.

The House of Gaunt - Lord Voldemort Origins

   alt

   Thank you for believing in this project as a bit insane as we are !

   Some of you have asked us what would be the purpose of the collected
   donations once the 100% have been reached. We answer you in 3 points :

   Incredible sets for the final battle !

   Special effects even more breathtaking !

   A better infrastructure for the post-production and a faster theatrical
   release !

   Obviously, the cumulative donations system (whatever the amount) for
   the compensations is always within the campaign. For example :

   If you have donated 20€, you will have the right to get the film in 4K
   digital version in preview, to the poster (and of course, your name in
   the credits).

   By giving another 20€, you won’t receive the movie twice (even if we
   know that you will adore it and that you will want to see it twice in a
   row !), but the compensation corresponding to a donation of 40€, that
   is to say the Star Pack which contains an invitation to the private
   showing of the movie in Paris with the movie team, followed by a debate
   and also a meeting… Without forgetting the 4K digital version of the
   film, the poster and your name in the credits !

   You are the ambassadors of this ambitious project,

   We are counting on you to keep sharing it !

   The House of Gaunt team.

   alt

   Imbused with esthetics of Harry Potter saga, and freely adapted from
   the book « Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince » written by J.K.
   Rowling, The House of Gaunt is a french (but in english) short-movie
   relating « darkly, violently and realistically » the origins and the
   height of Voldemort.

   Want to see the greatest black mage (played by Maxence Danet-Fauvel)
   like you had never seen him before ? There are still some shots to
   make, your support is essential.

   alt

   (former sponsors, we have sent you an email in which you will find a
   surprise, last September the 23) :

   Two years and a half ago, we launched our first Ulule campaign to begin
   the filming and according to the evolution of the short-movie and the
   related expectations, it was necessary to ensure the project’s quality
   to deploy a second one. Then, we sincerely thought that the proceeds
   would have been enough to finance and close this short-movie that many
   of you are waiting for… Unfortunately, we were not able to finish the
   filming of the whole second part of the short film dedicated to the
   climax of Voldemort.

   Indeed, the last filming session required many financial efforts in
   terms of location, technical equipment or special effects… and we
   preferred favouring the aesthetic quality and the artistic coherence,
   rather than botch certain crucial scenes and to tarnish the universe of
   the saga, or worse, to totally harm the original work…

   15% of the short-movie is all that remains to be filmed ! However, 15%
   corresponding to three days of work and for which we need to rent
   equipment, ensure transports…

   alt

   That is why we are asking for your help one last time to finally end
   the shooting of this short-movie which, as you have noticed and as we
   promise you that it will be… spectacular. If you already had made one
   or more donations, we do not expect you to do it again, but if you
   share this campaign to your friends, family, if you talk about it
   around you, your support would be as precious !

   Optimistic, we have already begun the preparations of this final
   shooting that we expect for the end of October / early November if the
   donations campaign that will end on October the XX is validated. The
   program includes : spells, broom pursuits, fights… we won’t say more
   but we can’t wait to show you !

   This is our last chance to end this short-movie in which you will see
   Voldemort as you have never seen it, to offer you a saga chapter never
   showed in the films. Since the beginning of 2016 when we had started
   the writing of the scenario, we invest all of our energy and passion
   hoping that this short-movie will finally see the light of day. And
   your messages of support are a Felix Felicis flask of everyday. It is a
   project which transports us and we hope that it will be able to
   « port-key-rry » you with us, that you will be proud of you for having
   contributed to its financial, to have brought it out of the shadow !

   These 20 days can change everything, we are counting on you !

   This movie tells the origins of Lord Voldemort, from the meeting
   between his mother, Merope Gaunt, and his father, Tom Jedusor Senior,
   to the height of the biggest dark wizard of all times. Condensed of
   tensions, emotions and sparkles, it raises a new portrait of the Gaunt
   family and of Voldemort, well aged of 30 years. This script, co-written
   by the director Joris FAUCON GRIMAUD and Thomas ROKITA, comes from the
   book « Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince » of J.K. Rowling and it
   is intended to be the most faithful to the author work and its
   universe. Backed by the support which it already received, this short
   movie is carried by a team of cinema lovers also first hour fans of
   Harry Potter universe. We dreamt about filming a movie in this universe
   as long as it be the most professional, and it’s about to happen !

   alt

   We want this adaptation to delight both fans and spectators less
   familiar with this universe, so that short movie is accessible to
   everyone. In order to do this, and despite the budgetary obligations,
   we globally adapt. It’s why we make a fantasy (and pretty horrific)
   thriller : to offer an oppressive, realistic, even violent atmosphere,
   while keeping the spirit of books and movies.

   alt

   The Gaunt family comes from an old line of pureblood wizards, the last
   heirs of Salazar Slytherin, one of the founding members of Hogwarts. If
   it was a wealthy family in the 20’s, its members were more well-known
   for their instability and their pronounced taste for the violence.

   Bob Ogden, the department Head of police of the Ministry of Magic, goes
   to Elvis Gaunt’s with a subpoena for his son, Morfin. Last night, that
   latter cast a spell upon a Muggle. Bob then meets a young woman, Merope
   Gaunt, who looks through the window a Muggle named Tom Jedusor Senior.

   Bob doesn’t know it yet, but the event which is about to happen will be
   decisive for the birth of Voldemort, the darkest Lord of all times.

   As announced before, we are driven by the ambition to honor this saga
   which lulled our childhood and we want to offer you a result that meets
   your expectations. That is why we are launching a final crowdfunding
   campaign in order to end the shooting of this short-movie (only 15%
   left !). Even if this movie doesn’t have any prospect of profitability,
   and that it will not generate any profit because it is led by a team of
   volunteers, however some costs remains unavoidable (equipment rents,
   special effects…)

   alt

   alt

   Once post-product, we will compete this film in various international
   festivals and we also aim for a theatrical release, in France and
   abroad, before it is posted on YouTube.
