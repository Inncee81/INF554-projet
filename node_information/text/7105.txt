Bank mergers don’t address crux of crisis: The nexus between lenders,

The problem of skilling India

   07 Sep 2019

Caste politics is being reinvigorated by actors who traditionally opposed it

   22 Aug 2019
   Quota and bad faith Quota and bad faith UP’s case shows that the way
   the state government is revisiting India’s model of positive
   discrimination is as debatable as the initiatives of the Modi
   government at the Centre and the Fadnavis government in Maharashtra.
   (Illustration by C R Sasikumar)

   The constitutional amendment by the Modi government in order to
   introduce a 10 per cent quota for the poor within the “general”
   category looks like an attempt, five months before general elections,
   at wooing upper caste voters longing for the jobs that were to be part
   of “acche din”. This is at odds with the initial rationale of India’s
   positive discrimination programmes, which were intended to make up for
   past oppression — and not as an employment scheme.

   Advertising

   This is not the only recent move by the BJP to cash in on reservation.
   While the constitutional amendment does not mention caste, Maharashtra
   Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has taken up the previous Congress
   government’s idea in favour of reservation for Marathas, the largest
   dominant caste asking for quotas. These initiatives contradict the
   traditional Hindu nationalist stand, expressed in the name of merit,
   against positive discrimination. The latter even clashes with the
   Sangh’s formula that gained momentum during the Mandal affair: If
   reservation had to take place, it had to be according to economic
   criteria. None of these initiatives could bear fruit because of the
   systematic rejection by the judiciary of quotas beyond 50 per cent —
   Tamil Nadu being the only exception.

   In contrast, the Yogi Adityanath government is revisiting the existing
   quotas in Uttar Pradesh in a much more effective manner. After assuming
   office in 2017, the state BJP government had appointed an OBC Social
   Justice Committee headed by Justice Raghvendra Kumar. The committee
   submitted its report in 2018, recommending that the 27 per cent quota
   for the OBCs should be dispatched between three sub-categories: The
   Backward Classes (BCs) would get 7 per cent of the reservations, the
   Very Backward Classes (VBCs) 9 per cent and the Most Backward Classes
   (MBCs) 11 per cent. Among the BCs figured nine jatis out of 79 —
   including Yadavs, Kurmis, Kalwars, Kalals and Kallars. Among the VBCs
   were found 33 jatis, including Gujjars, Lodhs, Kacchhis and Gadariyas.
   And among the MBCs, were 37 jatis, including Mallahs, Nishads and
   Rajbhars. This subcategorisation, which has already been implemented by
   other states including Bihar, was justified on the grounds that the
   BCs, also called the “aristocratic class” in the report, had cornered
   most of the reservation benefits at the expense of the others. However,
   this assumption is not substantiated by any data in the report.
   Similarly, the status of the OBC castes under review is qualified
   arbitrarily. For instance, the BCs are presented as members or former
   members of the “Vaishya caste, the caste in the third position of the
   Varna system”. They are also described as “similar to Brahmins and
   Kshatriyas”. In contrast, the MBCs are shown in an unfavourable light,
   as people who “believe in magic” and “regularly consume local liquor in
   the evening”.

   Whether the BCs do benefit more from positive discrimination than other
   OBCs is very difficult to determine. In fact, this is exactly what the
   UP government should have tried to ascertain. But we can use the Indian
   Human Development Survey to come to an approximate response. It shows
   that between 2004-5 and 2011-12 most of the large OBC jatis have
   improved their economic situation in the same proportion. Their annual
   per capita income (APCI) has multiplied by roughly three times: The
   Kurmis’ APCI has jumped from Rs 9,286 to Rs 25,989 and is second only
   to the Brahmins (ahead of the APCI of the “other upper castes”); the
   Yadavs’ has increased from Rs 5,623 to Rs 17,894, that of the Kacchhis
   from Rs 5,238 to Rs 15,064, that of the Telis from Rs 4,708 to Rs
   12,789 and that of the Nishads from Rs 3,396 to Rs 12,596. Those who
   are lagging behind are the Jats, whose APCI multiplied by only two,
   from Rs 8,307 to Rs 17,867, like the Lodhs (from Rs 5,616 to Rs
   10,300), whereas the Gadariyas were below doubling their income (from
   Rs 9,512 to 16,016) and the Rajbhars did slightly better (from Rs 5,351
   to Rs 12, 476).
   Advertising

   The three categories in the report are not applicable from the point of
   view of the percentage of caste members occupying salaried jobs as
   well. For instance, in 2011-12 this proportion reached 13 per cent in
   the case of Gadariyas (VBCs), whereas it was below 6 per cent among
   Kurmis (BCs). Incidentally, the Kurmis could hardly be accused of
   cornering reservation if less than 6 per cent of them had a salaried
   job — whereas Yadavs may be a more plausible usual suspect with 14.5
   per cent. For Kurmis, the correlation between reservation and caste
   achievements works more in the case of education, since 8.3 per cent of
   them graduated in 2011-12. But it does not work in the case of the
   Yadavs, who have apparently not benefited more than others from
   reservation in the university, as only 4.7 per cent of them were
   graduates in 2011-12 — not more than Telis.

   In fact, most of the BCs are either farmers or agricultural labourers,
   like the rest of the OBCs. In 2011-12, that was the case of,
   respectively, 68 per cent and 15 per cent of Kurmis, 56 per cent and 17
   per cent of the Yadavs. In fact, the edge the Kurmis and Yadavs have
   over the others is actually due to their over-representation among the
   farmers and their under-representation among the agricultural
   labourers. In contrast, among the Kacchhis 45 per cent were farmers and
   34 per cent labourers, the Nishads, were respectively 16 and 54 per
   cent, the Rajbhars, 16 and 64 per cent and even the Jats 31 and 64 per
   cent. To make the OBCs more egalitarian, the issue to address is
   less-related to reservations than to the agrarian structure. But, to
   announce new sub-quotas to caste groups which have been marginalised is
   easier than land reform.

   The methodology of the OBC Social Justice Committee was flawed for two
   other reasons. First, while it intended to do justice to the poor, it
   continued to rely on caste — not class — as the unit of analysis. This
   contradiction is obvious in the case of the BCs, whose quotas will be
   reduced at the expense of the poor Yadavs and Kurmis who will have to
   compete with affluent Yadavs and Kurmis for fewer jobs and fewer seats
   in the university system if the report under review is implemented.
   Second, the “creamy layer” concept is not mentioned even once in this
   report, whereas it would make sense to adjust this notion in order to
   solve, at least partly, the contradiction we have just mentioned.

   UP’s case shows that the way the state government is revisiting India’s
   model of positive discrimination is as debatable as the initiatives of
   the Modi government at the Centre and the Fadnavis government in
   Maharashtra. All this does not mean that the system does not need to be
   reformed in order to promote equality — besides other policies,
   including land reform. Reservation is far from a panacea, and
   definitely not an employment scheme. Incidentally, Hardik Patel, the
   leader of the Patidars who are asking for reservation in Gujarat, is
   now saying that better agricultural prices may be more important than
   quotas.

Bank mergers don’t address crux of crisis: The nexus between lenders,

The problem of skilling India

   07 Sep 2019

Caste politics is being reinvigorated by actors who traditionally opposed it

   22 Aug 2019
   Quota and bad faith Quota and bad faith UP’s case shows that the way
   the state government is revisiting India’s model of positive
   discrimination is as debatable as the initiatives of the Modi
   government at the Centre and the Fadnavis government in Maharashtra.

   The constitutional amendment by the Modi government in order to
   introduce a 10 per cent quota for the poor within the “general”
   category looks like an attempt, five months before general elections,
   at wooing upper caste voters longing for the jobs that were to be part
   of “acche din”. This is at odds with the initial rationale of India’s
   positive discrimination programmes, which were intended to make up for
   past oppression — and not as an employment scheme.

   Advertising

   This is not the only recent move by the BJP to cash in on reservation.
   While the constitutional amendment does not mention caste, Maharashtra
   Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has taken up the previous Congress
   government’s idea in favour of reservation for Marathas, the largest
   dominant caste asking for quotas. These initiatives contradict the
   traditional Hindu nationalist stand, expressed in the name of merit,
   against positive discrimination. The latter even clashes with the
   Sangh’s formula that gained momentum during the Mandal affair: If
   reservation had to take place, it had to be according to economic
   criteria. None of these initiatives could bear fruit because of the
   systematic rejection by the judiciary of quotas beyond 50 per cent —
   Tamil Nadu being the only exception.

   In contrast, the Yogi Adityanath government is revisiting the existing
   quotas in Uttar Pradesh in a much more effective manner. After assuming
   office in 2017, the state BJP government had appointed an OBC Social
   Justice Committee headed by Justice Raghvendra Kumar. The committee
   submitted its report in 2018, recommending that the 27 per cent quota
   for the OBCs should be dispatched between three sub-categories: The
   Backward Classes (BCs) would get 7 per cent of the reservations, the
   Very Backward Classes (VBCs) 9 per cent and the Most Backward Classes
   (MBCs) 11 per cent. Among the BCs figured nine jatis out of 79 —
   including Yadavs, Kurmis, Kalwars, Kalals and Kallars. Among the VBCs
   were found 33 jatis, including Gujjars, Lodhs, Kacchhis and Gadariyas.
   And among the MBCs, were 37 jatis, including Mallahs, Nishads and
   Rajbhars. This subcategorisation, which has already been implemented by
   other states including Bihar, was justified on the grounds that the
   BCs, also called the “aristocratic class” in the report, had cornered
   most of the reservation benefits at the expense of the others. However,
   this assumption is not substantiated by any data in the report.
   Similarly, the status of the OBC castes under review is qualified
   arbitrarily. For instance, the BCs are presented as members or former
   members of the “Vaishya caste, the caste in the third position of the
   Varna system”. They are also described as “similar to Brahmins and
   Kshatriyas”. In contrast, the MBCs are shown in an unfavourable light,
   as people who “believe in magic” and “regularly consume local liquor in
   the evening”.

   Whether the BCs do benefit more from positive discrimination than other
   OBCs is very difficult to determine. In fact, this is exactly what the
   UP government should have tried to ascertain. But we can use the Indian
   Human Development Survey to come to an approximate response. It shows
   that between 2004-5 and 2011-12 most of the large OBC jatis have
   improved their economic situation in the same proportion. Their annual
   per capita income (APCI) has multiplied by roughly three times: The
   Kurmis’ APCI has jumped from Rs 9,286 to Rs 25,989 and is second only
   to the Brahmins (ahead of the APCI of the “other upper castes”); the
   Yadavs’ has increased from Rs 5,623 to Rs 17,894, that of the Kacchhis
   from Rs 5,238 to Rs 15,064, that of the Telis from Rs 4,708 to Rs
   12,789 and that of the Nishads from Rs 3,396 to Rs 12,596. Those who
   are lagging behind are the Jats, whose APCI multiplied by only two,
   from Rs 8,307 to Rs 17,867, like the Lodhs (from Rs 5,616 to Rs
   10,300), whereas the Gadariyas were below doubling their income (from
   Rs 9,512 to 16,016) and the Rajbhars did slightly better (from Rs 5,351
   to Rs 12, 476).
   Advertising

   The three categories in the report are not applicable from the point of
   view of the percentage of caste members occupying salaried jobs as
   well. For instance, in 2011-12 this proportion reached 13 per cent in
   the case of Gadariyas (VBCs), whereas it was below 6 per cent among
   Kurmis (BCs). Incidentally, the Kurmis could hardly be accused of
   cornering reservation if less than 6 per cent of them had a salaried
   job — whereas Yadavs may be a more plausible usual suspect with 14.5
   per cent. For Kurmis, the correlation between reservation and caste
   achievements works more in the case of education, since 8.3 per cent of
   them graduated in 2011-12. But it does not work in the case of the
   Yadavs, who have apparently not benefited more than others from
   reservation in the university, as only 4.7 per cent of them were
   graduates in 2011-12 — not more than Telis.

   In fact, most of the BCs are either farmers or agricultural labourers,
   like the rest of the OBCs. In 2011-12, that was the case of,
   respectively, 68 per cent and 15 per cent of Kurmis, 56 per cent and 17
   per cent of the Yadavs. In fact, the edge the Kurmis and Yadavs have
   over the others is actually due to their over-representation among the
   farmers and their under-representation among the agricultural
   labourers. In contrast, among the Kacchhis 45 per cent were farmers and
   34 per cent labourers, the Nishads, were respectively 16 and 54 per
   cent, the Rajbhars, 16 and 64 per cent and even the Jats 31 and 64 per
   cent. To make the OBCs more egalitarian, the issue to address is
   less-related to reservations than to the agrarian structure. But, to
   announce new sub-quotas to caste groups which have been marginalised is
   easier than land reform.

   The methodology of the OBC Social Justice Committee was flawed for two
   other reasons. First, while it intended to do justice to the poor, it
   continued to rely on caste — not class — as the unit of analysis. This
   contradiction is obvious in the case of the BCs, whose quotas will be
   reduced at the expense of the poor Yadavs and Kurmis who will have to
   compete with affluent Yadavs and Kurmis for fewer jobs and fewer seats
   in the university system if the report under review is implemented.
   Second, the “creamy layer” concept is not mentioned even once in this
   report, whereas it would make sense to adjust this notion in order to
   solve, at least partly, the contradiction we have just mentioned.

   UP’s case shows that the way the state government is revisiting India’s
   model of positive discrimination is as debatable as the initiatives of
   the Modi government at the Centre and the Fadnavis government in
   Maharashtra. All this does not mean that the system does not need to be
   reformed in order to promote equality — besides other policies,
   including land reform. Reservation is far from a panacea, and
   definitely not an employment scheme. Incidentally, Hardik Patel, the
   leader of the Patidars who are asking for reservation in Gujarat, is
   now saying that better agricultural prices may be more important than
   quotas.

Caste politics is being reinvigorated by actors who traditionally opposed it

   Quota and bad faith Quota and bad faith UP’s case shows that the way
   the state government is revisiting India’s model of positive
   discrimination is as debatable as the initiatives of the Modi
   government at the Centre and the Fadnavis government in Maharashtra.

   The constitutional amendment by the Modi government in order to
   introduce a 10 per cent quota for the poor within the “general”
   category looks like an attempt, five months before general elections,
   at wooing upper caste voters longing for the jobs that were to be part
   of “acche din”. This is at odds with the initial rationale of India’s
   positive discrimination programmes, which were intended to make up for
   past oppression — and not as an employment scheme.

   This is not the only recent move by the BJP to cash in on reservation.
   While the constitutional amendment does not mention caste, Maharashtra
   Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has taken up the previous Congress
   government’s idea in favour of reservation for Marathas, the largest
   dominant caste asking for quotas. These initiatives contradict the
   traditional Hindu nationalist stand, expressed in the name of merit,
   against positive discrimination. The latter even clashes with the
   Sangh’s formula that gained momentum during the Mandal affair: If
   reservation had to take place, it had to be according to economic
   criteria. None of these initiatives could bear fruit because of the
   systematic rejection by the judiciary of quotas beyond 50 per cent —
   Tamil Nadu being the only exception.

   In contrast, the Yogi Adityanath government is revisiting the existing
   quotas in Uttar Pradesh in a much more effective manner. After assuming
   office in 2017, the state BJP government had appointed an OBC Social
   Justice Committee headed by Justice Raghvendra Kumar. The committee
   submitted its report in 2018, recommending that the 27 per cent quota
   for the OBCs should be dispatched between three sub-categories: The
   Backward Classes (BCs) would get 7 per cent of the reservations, the
   Very Backward Classes (VBCs) 9 per cent and the Most Backward Classes
   (MBCs) 11 per cent. Among the BCs figured nine jatis out of 79 —
   including Yadavs, Kurmis, Kalwars, Kalals and Kallars. Among the VBCs
   were found 33 jatis, including Gujjars, Lodhs, Kacchhis and Gadariyas.
   And among the MBCs, were 37 jatis, including Mallahs, Nishads and
   Rajbhars. This subcategorisation, which has already been implemented by
   other states including Bihar, was justified on the grounds that the
   BCs, also called the “aristocratic class” in the report, had cornered
   most of the reservation benefits at the expense of the others. However,
   this assumption is not substantiated by any data in the report.
   Similarly, the status of the OBC castes under review is qualified
   arbitrarily. For instance, the BCs are presented as members or former
   members of the “Vaishya caste, the caste in the third position of the
   Varna system”. They are also described as “similar to Brahmins and
   Kshatriyas”. In contrast, the MBCs are shown in an unfavourable light,
   as people who “believe in magic” and “regularly consume local liquor in
   the evening”.

   Whether the BCs do benefit more from positive discrimination than other
   OBCs is very difficult to determine. In fact, this is exactly what the
   UP government should have tried to ascertain. But we can use the Indian
   Human Development Survey to come to an approximate response. It shows
   that between 2004-5 and 2011-12 most of the large OBC jatis have
   improved their economic situation in the same proportion. Their annual
   per capita income (APCI) has multiplied by roughly three times: The
   Kurmis’ APCI has jumped from Rs 9,286 to Rs 25,989 and is second only
   to the Brahmins (ahead of the APCI of the “other upper castes”); the
   Yadavs’ has increased from Rs 5,623 to Rs 17,894, that of the Kacchhis
   from Rs 5,238 to Rs 15,064, that of the Telis from Rs 4,708 to Rs
   12,789 and that of the Nishads from Rs 3,396 to Rs 12,596. Those who
   are lagging behind are the Jats, whose APCI multiplied by only two,
   from Rs 8,307 to Rs 17,867, like the Lodhs (from Rs 5,616 to Rs
   10,300), whereas the Gadariyas were below doubling their income (from
   Rs 9,512 to 16,016) and the Rajbhars did slightly better (from Rs 5,351
   to Rs 12, 476).

   The three categories in the report are not applicable from the point of
   view of the percentage of caste members occupying salaried jobs as
   well. For instance, in 2011-12 this proportion reached 13 per cent in
   the case of Gadariyas (VBCs), whereas it was below 6 per cent among
   Kurmis (BCs). Incidentally, the Kurmis could hardly be accused of
   cornering reservation if less than 6 per cent of them had a salaried
   job — whereas Yadavs may be a more plausible usual suspect with 14.5
   per cent. For Kurmis, the correlation between reservation and caste
   achievements works more in the case of education, since 8.3 per cent of
   them graduated in 2011-12. But it does not work in the case of the
   Yadavs, who have apparently not benefited more than others from
   reservation in the university, as only 4.7 per cent of them were
   graduates in 2011-12 — not more than Telis.

   In fact, most of the BCs are either farmers or agricultural labourers,
   like the rest of the OBCs. In 2011-12, that was the case of,
   respectively, 68 per cent and 15 per cent of Kurmis, 56 per cent and 17
   per cent of the Yadavs. In fact, the edge the Kurmis and Yadavs have
   over the others is actually due to their over-representation among the
   farmers and their under-representation among the agricultural
   labourers. In contrast, among the Kacchhis 45 per cent were farmers and
   34 per cent labourers, the Nishads, were respectively 16 and 54 per
   cent, the Rajbhars, 16 and 64 per cent and even the Jats 31 and 64 per
   cent. To make the OBCs more egalitarian, the issue to address is
   less-related to reservations than to the agrarian structure. But, to
   announce new sub-quotas to caste groups which have been marginalised is
   easier than land reform.

   The methodology of the OBC Social Justice Committee was flawed for two
   other reasons. First, while it intended to do justice to the poor, it
   continued to rely on caste — not class — as the unit of analysis. This
   contradiction is obvious in the case of the BCs, whose quotas will be
   reduced at the expense of the poor Yadavs and Kurmis who will have to
   compete with affluent Yadavs and Kurmis for fewer jobs and fewer seats
   in the university system if the report under review is implemented.
   Second, the “creamy layer” concept is not mentioned even once in this
   report, whereas it would make sense to adjust this notion in order to
   solve, at least partly, the contradiction we have just mentioned.

   UP’s case shows that the way the state government is revisiting India’s
   model of positive discrimination is as debatable as the initiatives of
   the Modi government at the Centre and the Fadnavis government in
   Maharashtra. All this does not mean that the system does not need to be
   reformed in order to promote equality — besides other policies,
   including land reform. Reservation is far from a panacea, and
   definitely not an employment scheme. Incidentally, Hardik Patel, the
   leader of the Patidars who are asking for reservation in Gujarat, is
   now saying that better agricultural prices may be more important than
   quotas.
