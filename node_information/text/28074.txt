   Souq.com was active in three countries, United Arab Emirates, Saudi
   Arabia and Egypt, and was built on the Amazon model with retail,
   fulfillment and marketplace, with more than 50 million active users

   spearheaded a consulting company that managed numerous web and
   e-commerce projects in the Arab world.

   With a family background in trading, combined with a passion for
   innovation and technology, Mouchawar was inspired to start, develop and
   lead the e-commerce market in this region.  As keen to set high goals
   for himself and his team in his career as he did as a basketball
   player, he is an inspiration to young entrepreneurs looking to blaze
   their own trail and is passionate about creating jobs for Arabs and
   recruiting like-minded entrepreneurs to join his growing team.

   In March 2015, Mouchawar received an award from His Highness Sheikh
