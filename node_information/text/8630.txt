   Blue Origin, billionaire Jeff Bezos' spaceflight company, has secured
   its first satellite customer for its orbital rocket, named New Glenn.
   The company also released a video illustrating how the reusable rocket
   will launch, deliver a payload and land its first-stage booster.

   The animated video shows a New Glenn rocket lifting off from what
   appears to be Launch Complex 36 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in
   Florida, which the company is leasing. High above the Earth, the
   rocket's first stage separates from the payload carrier, which then
   delivers a satellite into orbit; the first stage then returns to Earth
   and touches down vertically on a ship's landing pad.

   Blue Origin has now secured a contract to use New Glenn to launch a
   geostationary satellite for Eutelsat Communications, sometime in 2021
   or 2022, according to a statement from Eutelsat released today (March
   7). [Blue Origin's Giant New Glenn Rocket in Pictures]

   "In including New Glenn in our manifest, we are pursuing our
   longstanding strategy of innovation that drives down the cost of access
   to space and drives up performance," Rodolphe Belmer, Eutelsat
   CEO, said in the statement. "This can only be good news for the
   profitability and sustainability of our industry."

   The New Glenn rocket is named after NASA astronaut John Glenn, the
   first American to orbit Earth. Blue Origin has unveiled plans for
   two-stage and three-stage versions of New Glenn, both with a reusable
   first stage and an identical second stage. Each of the rockets will be
   powered by seven of the company's BE-4 engines (the optional third
   stage will use a BE-3 engine), burning liquefied natural gas and liquid
   oxygen. The company also has a contract to sell the BE-4 engines to
   United Launch Alliance to power its new Vulcan rocket.

   Bezos revealed new details about New Glenn at the Satellite 2017
   conference in Washington, D.C., this week, according to an article by
   SpaceNews reporter Jeff Foust. Bezos said New Glenn would be capable of
   launching up to 13 metric tons (about 28,000 lbs.) into geostationary
   transfer orbit and 45 metric tons (about 99,000 lbs.) into low-Earth
   orbit. That would make the rocket "one of the largest vehicles in
   service," according to Foust's article.

   booster will land on a ship.

   Blue Origin is also building a 750,000-square-foot production facility
   for its New Glenn rockets in Exploration Park, located next to NASA's
   Kennedy Space Center and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.

   The company has already made successful test launches of its suborbital
   New Shepard rocket, which the company plans to use to carry payloads
   and human passengers to suborbital heights. Those launches have
   included successful landings of the reusable New Shepard booster.

Exclusive 'Chasing the Moon' Clip Spotlights Poppy Northcutt, NASA's 1st
Woman in Mission Control

   She was a trailblazer among trailblazers: An exclusive new clip from
   the upcoming PBS documentary "Chasing the Moon" profiles the challenges
   and triumphs of Poppy Northcutt, the first woman to work in Mission
   Control.

   Northcutt was a return-to-Earth specialist who worked in the Mission
   Control in Houston starting with Apollo 8.

   "I started off working as a computress — I don't know why they called
   them computresses — we weren't necessarily doing computer work,"
   Northcutt says in the video. "It was sort of like 'Mad Men'; that was a
   fairly accurate description of the world for women. But I was really
   fascinated. I wanted to know what I was doing and why I was doing it,
   and I had a math degree. I'd taken a celestial mechanics course."

   Poppy Northcutt, pictured here in 1968, was the first woman in an
   operational support role to work in NASA's Mission Control Center in
   Houston.

   Eventually, she made it into Mission Control, and her modern-day
   description of what it was like is interspersed with news coverage she
   appeared in from the era.

   "The mere fact that a lot of women found out for the first time that
   there was a woman in Mission Control was a very big deal," Northcutt
   says in the clip. "I thought it was important that people understand
   that women can do these jobs — going into science, going into
   technology. Doing something that's not stereotypical."

   "Chasing the Moon," airing July 8-10 in the PBS "American Experience"
   series, will be a six-part documentary about the space race just in
   time for the Apollo 11 moon landing's 50th anniversary. According to a
   statement from PBS, in addition to profiling Northcutt, the series
   includes interviews with astronauts Buzz Aldrin, Frank Borman and Bill
   Anders; futurist Freeman Dyson; Sergei Khrushchev, a rocket engineer
   and the son of former Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev; and Ed Dwight,
   who trained as America's first black astronaut. The series is written,
   produced and directed by Robert Stone.

Io: Facts about Jupiter’s Volcanic Moon

   Jupiter-Io Montage
   This is a montage of New Horizons images of Jupiter and its volcanic
   moon Io, taken during the spacecraft’s Jupiter flyby . The image was
   released in Oct. 2007.

   Laboratory/Southwest Research Institute)

   Jupiter's fifth moon, Io, is the most volcanically active body in the
   solar system. Plumes of sulfur spew upward as high as 190 miles (300
   kilometers). The surface of Io is splotched with lava lakes and
   floodplains of liquid rock.

   Astronomers have mapped about 150 volcanoes on the moon, some of which
   blast lava 250 miles (400 km) out into space. There are volcanoes all
   over Io's surface, and as scientists perform observations they still
   occasionally see new hotspots pop up. For example, NASA's Juno
   spacecraft, which is currently orbiting Jupiter, found a possible new
   hotspot on Io on Dec. 16, 2017.(k r

Io by the numbers

   Age: Io is about 4.5 billion years old, about the same age as Jupiter.

   Distance from Jupiter: Io is the fifth moon from Jupiter. Its average
   orbital distance is about 262,000 miles (422,000 km). Io takes 1.77
   Earth-days to orbit Jupiter. Io is tidally locked, so the same side
   always faces Jupiter.

   Size: Io has a mean radius of 1,131.7 miles, making it slightly larger
   than Earth's moon. It has a slight elliptical shape, with its longest
   axis directed toward Jupiter. Among the Galilean satellites Io ranks
   third, behind Ganymede and Callisto but ahead of Europa, in both mass
   and volume.

   Temperature: Io's surface temperature averages about minus 202 degrees
   Fahrenheit (minus 130 Celsius), resulting in the formation of sulfur
   dioxide snowfields. But Io's volcanoes can reach 3,000 F (1,649 C). Io
   is often referred to as a celestial body of fire and ice.

The Discovery of Io

   global magma "ocean" (shown in orange) lies beneath a crust 30 to 50
   kilometers thick. The rest of Io's mantle is shown in gold, while the
   moon's core is rendered in silver.

   Io was the first of Jupiter’s moons discovered by Galileo Galilei on
   Jan. 8, 1610. He actually discovered the moon the day prior, but could
   not differentiate between Io and Europa, another Jupiter moon, until
   the next night. The discovery, along with three other Jovian moons, was
   the first time a moon was discovered orbiting a planet other than
   Earth. Galileo's discovery eventually led to the understanding that
   planets orbit the sun, instead of our solar system revolving around
   Earth.

   Galileo first referred to this moon as Jupiter I. In the mid-1800s, the
   moon was renamed Io. In Greek mythology, Io was a priestess of Hera
   (Zeus' wife) and the daughter of Inachus, the king of Argos. Zeus (the
   counterpart for the Roman god Jupiter) fell in love with her, but
   turned her into a cow to avoid being caught with her by his wife, Hera
   (or Juno).

   Several spacecraft have flown by Jupiter and its moons. Pioneer 10
   arrived first, in 1973, followed by Pioneer 11 in 1974. Voyager 1 and
   Voyager 2 returned striking photos during their flybys. The Galileo
   spacecraft passed as low as 162 miles (261 km) over the surfaces of the
   Galilean moons and produced detailed images.

Characteristics of Io

   Jupiter. Among many other auroral structures, the Io footprint is the
   most equator-ward feature close to the centre of the image. This spot
   is always located close to the feet of the magnetic field lines
   connected to the satellite Io.

   connected to the satellite Io.

   The interior of Io is composed of an iron or iron sulfide core and a
   brown silicate outer layer, giving the planet a splotchy orange,
   yellow, black, red, and white appearance.

   Based on data from scientific computer models, Io formed in a region
   around Jupiter where water ice was plentiful. Io's heat, combined with
   the possibility that there was water on Io shortly after it was formed,
   could have made life possible, although Jupiter's radiation would have
   removed the water from the surface.

   The moon's most distinctive features are its volcanoes. Aside from
   Earth, Io is the only known body in the solar system to have observed
   active volcanoes. While Galileo had made some cryptic notes inferring
   possible volcanic activity, NASA's Voyager spacecraft discovered Io's
   volcanoes in 1979.

   The volcanic activity is a result of Io being stretched and squeezed as
   it orbits Jupiter. Io's rock surface bulges up and down by as much as
   100 meters (328 feet) during the process. This affects Io's volcanic
   activity in a similar way to which Earth's oceans react to the moon.
   Io's irregularly elliptical orbit also heightens the tidal activity.
   Researchers are interested in watching the long-term activity of Io,
   which used to be difficult because telescopes on Earth lacked the
   resolution to look at hotspots. However, using the adaptive optics
   systems of two of the world's largest telescopes, astronomers were able
   to cancel out 6 the wavy effects of our atmosphere, allowing more close
   looks at the moon's active volcanoes. They tracked 48 hotspots from
   2013 through 2015. Earth-based observations have also looked shown
   waves in lava lakess, providing more detail about how magma cycles on
   Io's surface.

   Because of the volcanic activity, Io's atmosphere contains mostly
   sulphur dioxide. Io's orbit cuts across Jupiter's powerful magnetic
   lines of force, turning Io into an electric generator. As Jupiter
   rotates, the magnetic forces strip away about a ton of Io's material
   every second. The material becomes ionized and forms a doughnut-shaped
   cloud of radiation called a plasma torus. Some of the ions are pulled
   into Jupiter's upper atmosphere and create auroras. An example of this
   activity was spotted by the Hubble Space Telescope, which revealed the
   influences of Io and another Jovian moon, Ganymede, in Jupiter's
   auroras in 2018.

   Io also has a collapsible atmosphere, according to observations from
   the Gemini North telescope in Hawaii and the Texas Echelon Cross
   Echelle Spectrograph (TEXES) released in 2018. The sulfur dioxide
   envelope of gas freezes up while Io is in the shadow of Jupiter every
   day. When Io comes back into sunlight, the freezing sulfur dioxide
   converts to gas once more. Scientists long suspected this phenomenon
   exists, but it was only after this new study — which saw Io's
   atmosphere in the dark for the first time — that researchers confirmed
   it.

Explosive mysteries

   Io's environment has come under intense scrutiny in recent years as
   scientists try to explain why the moon has the most active volcanoes in
   the solar system. The recent findings involve both observations of the
   moon and modeling of the interior, which can only be inferred.

   A 2015 study explained why Io's most prolific volcanoes appear to be
   offset from where scientists expected they would be. While previous
   models suggested that the zones with the most intense heating would
   have more active volcanoes, the actual Io had its most active ones
   farther east. The study suggests that if there was an ocean mixed with
   molten and solid rock underneath the moon, the rock portions would rub
   against each other and create the offset zones scientists observed.
   However, the existence of a molten ocean came into doubt with a 2017
   study, which showed that some auroras we can see in Io's atmosphere
   would have been damped out by an underground ocean. In other words, we
   can only see the auroras because the moon likely has no molten ocean,
   the study concluded.

   Insights into Io's surface may also come from a 2012 map published by
   the U.S. Geological Survey — the first to include the entire surface.
   The researchers said that volcanic activity would be among the things
   that could be studied with this map. The imagery includes observations
   from the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft, as well as Galileo.

   While there is no mission specifically planned to look at Io, other
   missions are now in the vicinity of the moon — such as the
   aforementioned Juno spacecraft — or will be in future years. In the
   2020s, dNASA's Europa Clipper mission will investigate the habitability
   of another Galilean moon, Europa. The European Space Agency's JUICE
   mission (JUpiter ICy Moons Explorer), set to launch in 2022, will focus
   on Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. Meanwhile, observations continue from
   the ground; sometimes Io's volcanoes are violent enough to produce
   spectacular pictures even from so far away.

These Scientists Want to Send a NASA Probe to Jupiter's Volcanic Moon Io

   When it comes to moons of the outer solar system, potentially habitable
   worlds tend to steal the spotlight — but if a team of scientists get
   their way, NASA may send a mission to a world that's certainly dead
   biologically, but far from it geologically.

   That world, Jupiter's incredibly volcanic moon Io, is the target of a
   mission that scientists are proposing to NASA for the third time, after
   a refocusing that they hope will make the project more appealing to the
   space agency. Known as the Io Volcano Observer (IVO), the mission would
   launch in 2026 and arrive at its target in 2031. There, it would, as
   the mission's new motto goes, "follow the heat" in order to understand
   how the gravitational tugs that the moon experiences trigger its
   extreme volcanic eruptions.

   "Tidal heating is a process that is happening throughout the cosmos,"
   Alfred McEwen, a planetary geologist at the University of Arizona and
   the principal investigator on the IVO mission, told Space.com. On icy
   moons like Jupiter's Europa and Saturn's Enceladus, tidal heating melts
   their interiors to form the massive oceans that scientists believe or
   know to be hiding under the surface, and the same phenomenon is also
   believed to play out in other solar systems. But on Io, it's truly a
   force to be reckoned with. "Io is the best place to study it because it
   is so pronounced there," McEwen said.

   No space agency has ever sent a dedicated mission to Io; most of what
   scientists know about the moon today comes from the Voyager mission
   through the outer solar system, the Galileo mission to Jupiter and
   ground-based observations. Before Voyager flew by, scientists didn't
   even realize the moon hosted active volcanic eruptions, which are now
   its most famous characteristic.

   But for now, the only new data scientists can gather about the moon
   comes from the ground, and telescopes can't get a detailed look at Io's
   dramatic surface activity. "I would love to see another mission to Io,"
   Julie Rathbun, a planetary scientist at the Planetary Science Institute
   who studies Io's volcanism but who isn't involved in the IVO proposal,
   told Space.com. "Getting a mission to Io is just really hard."

   The proposed IVO mission would fit NASA's Discovery program, the same
   budgetary class that has included the Kepler planet-hunting telescope,
   the InSight lander that has just begun its work on Mars and the Dawn
   mission to the asteroid belt. In part, that relatively low price is
   enabled by reusing instruments designed for other spacecraft, including
   for the upcoming Europa Clipper and European Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer
   missions, as well as for the European-Japanese BepiColombo mission
   currently en route to Mercury.

   The mission's flight design helps make the spacecraft's radiation
   exposure more manageable. "We make close flybys, but they're very fast
   and furious because the radiation is intense, so we get out," McEwen
   said. The IVO probe would make 10 such flybys over the course of four
   years, each carefully timed to the signals of tidal heating, which
   powers the volcanoes.

   Tidal heating is the result of the gravitational interaction of
   different planetary bodies. In Io's case, its gravity interacts with
   those of its giant neighbor Jupiter, plus its companion moons, Europa
   and Ganymede. Those interactions are particularly strong because the
   moons' orbits are synched up: for every once Ganymede orbits, Europa
   orbits twice and Io orbits four times.

   That clockwork relationship, which scientists call Laplace resonance,
   means Io experiences particularly severe tidal heating. But scientists
   don't know precisely what's inside Io — whether its heart is molten
   rock or solid — which makes it difficult to know how that tidal heating
   is actually working.

   Illusions and Music

   IVO would solve that. Its instruments will be able to determine whether
   Io hides a global magma ocean or whether its volcanoes rise from mostly
   solid rock. They will also be able to measure the composition and
   temperature of lava on the moon's surface, which scientists can use to
   determine how violent and how frequent the eruptions are.

   The implications wouldn't be limited to a distant moon but to all
   worlds that experience tidal heating. And IVO may teach us about our
   own world as well.

   Life on Earth has weathered five major mass extinctions, and each
   extinction corresponds with upticks in dramatic volcanic activity,
   McEwen said. Io may be the closest model to eruptions that cataclysmic,
   pouring out that much lava and volcanic gas. "Io provides very
   large-scale lava eruptions, very high temperatures, of a sort that was
   common in the early histories of the terrestrial planets," McEwen said.
   "If you want to understand it, it's really better to see it happen, and
   Io's the only place to go to do that."

   Volcanic eruptions on Earth are notoriously complicated; it's why
   scientists can't predict eruptions despite their best monitoring. But
   at Io, not only are eruptions simple, they are also prevalent.

   "It's like this gift — if you really want to understand volcanism,
   here's where you go," Rathbun said. "Io is almost volcanoes in their
   pure form."

   Blue Origin, billionaire Jeff Bezos' spaceflight company, has secured
   its first satellite customer for its orbital rocket, named New Glenn.
   The company also released a video illustrating how the reusable rocket
   will launch, deliver a payload and land its first-stage booster.

   The animated video shows a New Glenn rocket lifting off from what
   appears to be Launch Complex 36 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in
   Florida, which the company is leasing. High above the Earth, the
   rocket's first stage separates from the payload carrier, which then
   delivers a satellite into orbit; the first stage then returns to Earth
   and touches down vertically on a ship's landing pad.

   Blue Origin has now secured a contract to use New Glenn to launch a
   geostationary satellite for Eutelsat Communications, sometime in 2021
   or 2022, according to a statement from Eutelsat released today (March
   7). [Blue Origin's Giant New Glenn Rocket in Pictures]

   "In including New Glenn in our manifest, we are pursuing our
   longstanding strategy of innovation that drives down the cost of access
   to space and drives up performance," Rodolphe Belmer, Eutelsat
   CEO, said in the statement. "This can only be good news for the
   profitability and sustainability of our industry."

   The New Glenn rocket is named after NASA astronaut John Glenn, the
   first American to orbit Earth. Blue Origin has unveiled plans for
   two-stage and three-stage versions of New Glenn, both with a reusable
   first stage and an identical second stage. Each of the rockets will be
   powered by seven of the company's BE-4 engines (the optional third
   stage will use a BE-3 engine), burning liquefied natural gas and liquid
   oxygen. The company also has a contract to sell the BE-4 engines to
   United Launch Alliance to power its new Vulcan rocket.

   Bezos revealed new details about New Glenn at the Satellite 2017
   conference in Washington, D.C., this week, according to an article by
   SpaceNews reporter Jeff Foust. Bezos said New Glenn would be capable of
   launching up to 13 metric tons (about 28,000 lbs.) into geostationary
   transfer orbit and 45 metric tons (about 99,000 lbs.) into low-Earth
   orbit. That would make the rocket "one of the largest vehicles in
   service," according to Foust's article.

   Blue Origin is also building a 750,000-square-foot production facility
   for its New Glenn rockets in Exploration Park, located next to NASA's
   Kennedy Space Center and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.

   The company has already made successful test launches of its suborbital
   New Shepard rocket, which the company plans to use to carry payloads
   and human passengers to suborbital heights. Those launches have
   included successful landings of the reusable New Shepard booster.

   She was a trailblazer among trailblazers: An exclusive new clip from
   the upcoming PBS documentary "Chasing the Moon" profiles the challenges
   and triumphs of Poppy Northcutt, the first woman to work in Mission
   Control.

   Northcutt was a return-to-Earth specialist who worked in the Mission
   Control in Houston starting with Apollo 8.

   "I started off working as a computress — I don't know why they called
   them computresses — we weren't necessarily doing computer work,"
   Northcutt says in the video. "It was sort of like 'Mad Men'; that was a
   fairly accurate description of the world for women. But I was really
   fascinated. I wanted to know what I was doing and why I was doing it,
   and I had a math degree. I'd taken a celestial mechanics course."

   Poppy Northcutt, pictured here in 1968, was the first woman in an
   operational support role to work in NASA's Mission Control Center in
   Houston.

   Eventually, she made it into Mission Control, and her modern-day
   description of what it was like is interspersed with news coverage she
   appeared in from the era.

   "The mere fact that a lot of women found out for the first time that
   there was a woman in Mission Control was a very big deal," Northcutt
   says in the clip. "I thought it was important that people understand
   that women can do these jobs — going into science, going into
   technology. Doing something that's not stereotypical."

   "Chasing the Moon," airing July 8-10 in the PBS "American Experience"
   series, will be a six-part documentary about the space race just in
   time for the Apollo 11 moon landing's 50th anniversary. According to a
   statement from PBS, in addition to profiling Northcutt, the series
   includes interviews with astronauts Buzz Aldrin, Frank Borman and Bill
   Anders; futurist Freeman Dyson; Sergei Khrushchev, a rocket engineer
   and the son of former Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev; and Ed Dwight,
   who trained as America's first black astronaut. The series is written,
   produced and directed by Robert Stone.

   Jupiter's fifth moon, Io, is the most volcanically active body in the
   solar system. Plumes of sulfur spew upward as high as 190 miles (300
   kilometers). The surface of Io is splotched with lava lakes and
   floodplains of liquid rock.

   Astronomers have mapped about 150 volcanoes on the moon, some of which
   blast lava 250 miles (400 km) out into space. There are volcanoes all
   over Io's surface, and as scientists perform observations they still
   occasionally see new hotspots pop up. For example, NASA's Juno
   spacecraft, which is currently orbiting Jupiter, found a possible new
   hotspot on Io on Dec. 16, 2017.(k r

Io by the numbers

   Age: Io is about 4.5 billion years old, about the same age as Jupiter.

   Distance from Jupiter: Io is the fifth moon from Jupiter. Its average
   orbital distance is about 262,000 miles (422,000 km). Io takes 1.77
   Earth-days to orbit Jupiter. Io is tidally locked, so the same side
   always faces Jupiter.

   Size: Io has a mean radius of 1,131.7 miles, making it slightly larger
   than Earth's moon. It has a slight elliptical shape, with its longest
   axis directed toward Jupiter. Among the Galilean satellites Io ranks
   third, behind Ganymede and Callisto but ahead of Europa, in both mass
   and volume.

   Temperature: Io's surface temperature averages about minus 202 degrees
   Fahrenheit (minus 130 Celsius), resulting in the formation of sulfur
   dioxide snowfields. But Io's volcanoes can reach 3,000 F (1,649 C). Io
   is often referred to as a celestial body of fire and ice.

The Discovery of Io

   Io was the first of Jupiter’s moons discovered by Galileo Galilei on
   Jan. 8, 1610. He actually discovered the moon the day prior, but could
   not differentiate between Io and Europa, another Jupiter moon, until
   the next night. The discovery, along with three other Jovian moons, was
   the first time a moon was discovered orbiting a planet other than
   Earth. Galileo's discovery eventually led to the understanding that
   planets orbit the sun, instead of our solar system revolving around
   Earth.

   Galileo first referred to this moon as Jupiter I. In the mid-1800s, the
   moon was renamed Io. In Greek mythology, Io was a priestess of Hera
   (Zeus' wife) and the daughter of Inachus, the king of Argos. Zeus (the
   counterpart for the Roman god Jupiter) fell in love with her, but
   turned her into a cow to avoid being caught with her by his wife, Hera
   (or Juno).

   Several spacecraft have flown by Jupiter and its moons. Pioneer 10
   arrived first, in 1973, followed by Pioneer 11 in 1974. Voyager 1 and
   Voyager 2 returned striking photos during their flybys. The Galileo
   spacecraft passed as low as 162 miles (261 km) over the surfaces of the
   Galilean moons and produced detailed images.

Characteristics of Io

   Jupiter. Among many other auroral structures, the Io footprint is the
   most equator-ward feature close to the centre of the image. This spot
   is always located close to the feet of the magnetic field lines
   connected to the satellite Io.

   The interior of Io is composed of an iron or iron sulfide core and a
   brown silicate outer layer, giving the planet a splotchy orange,
   yellow, black, red, and white appearance.

   Based on data from scientific computer models, Io formed in a region
   around Jupiter where water ice was plentiful. Io's heat, combined with
   the possibility that there was water on Io shortly after it was formed,
   could have made life possible, although Jupiter's radiation would have
   removed the water from the surface.

   The moon's most distinctive features are its volcanoes. Aside from
   Earth, Io is the only known body in the solar system to have observed
   active volcanoes. While Galileo had made some cryptic notes inferring
   possible volcanic activity, NASA's Voyager spacecraft discovered Io's
   volcanoes in 1979.

   The volcanic activity is a result of Io being stretched and squeezed as
   it orbits Jupiter. Io's rock surface bulges up and down by as much as
   100 meters (328 feet) during the process. This affects Io's volcanic
   activity in a similar way to which Earth's oceans react to the moon.
   Io's irregularly elliptical orbit also heightens the tidal activity.
   Researchers are interested in watching the long-term activity of Io,
   which used to be difficult because telescopes on Earth lacked the
   resolution to look at hotspots. However, using the adaptive optics
   systems of two of the world's largest telescopes, astronomers were able
   to cancel out 6 the wavy effects of our atmosphere, allowing more close
   looks at the moon's active volcanoes. They tracked 48 hotspots from
   2013 through 2015. Earth-based observations have also looked shown
   waves in lava lakess, providing more detail about how magma cycles on
   Io's surface.

   Because of the volcanic activity, Io's atmosphere contains mostly
   sulphur dioxide. Io's orbit cuts across Jupiter's powerful magnetic
   lines of force, turning Io into an electric generator. As Jupiter
   rotates, the magnetic forces strip away about a ton of Io's material
   every second. The material becomes ionized and forms a doughnut-shaped
   cloud of radiation called a plasma torus. Some of the ions are pulled
   into Jupiter's upper atmosphere and create auroras. An example of this
   activity was spotted by the Hubble Space Telescope, which revealed the
   influences of Io and another Jovian moon, Ganymede, in Jupiter's
   auroras in 2018.

   Io also has a collapsible atmosphere, according to observations from
   the Gemini North telescope in Hawaii and the Texas Echelon Cross
   Echelle Spectrograph (TEXES) released in 2018. The sulfur dioxide
   envelope of gas freezes up while Io is in the shadow of Jupiter every
   day. When Io comes back into sunlight, the freezing sulfur dioxide
   converts to gas once more. Scientists long suspected this phenomenon
   exists, but it was only after this new study — which saw Io's
   atmosphere in the dark for the first time — that researchers confirmed
   it.

Explosive mysteries

   Io's environment has come under intense scrutiny in recent years as
   scientists try to explain why the moon has the most active volcanoes in
   the solar system. The recent findings involve both observations of the
   moon and modeling of the interior, which can only be inferred.

   A 2015 study explained why Io's most prolific volcanoes appear to be
   offset from where scientists expected they would be. While previous
   models suggested that the zones with the most intense heating would
   have more active volcanoes, the actual Io had its most active ones
   farther east. The study suggests that if there was an ocean mixed with
   molten and solid rock underneath the moon, the rock portions would rub
   against each other and create the offset zones scientists observed.
   However, the existence of a molten ocean came into doubt with a 2017
   study, which showed that some auroras we can see in Io's atmosphere
   would have been damped out by an underground ocean. In other words, we
   can only see the auroras because the moon likely has no molten ocean,
   the study concluded.

   Insights into Io's surface may also come from a 2012 map published by
   the U.S. Geological Survey — the first to include the entire surface.
   The researchers said that volcanic activity would be among the things
   that could be studied with this map. The imagery includes observations
   from the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft, as well as Galileo.

   While there is no mission specifically planned to look at Io, other
   missions are now in the vicinity of the moon — such as the
   aforementioned Juno spacecraft — or will be in future years. In the
   2020s, dNASA's Europa Clipper mission will investigate the habitability
   of another Galilean moon, Europa. The European Space Agency's JUICE
   mission (JUpiter ICy Moons Explorer), set to launch in 2022, will focus
   on Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. Meanwhile, observations continue from
   the ground; sometimes Io's volcanoes are violent enough to produce
   spectacular pictures even from so far away.

These Scientists Want to Send a NASA Probe to Jupiter's Volcanic Moon Io

   When it comes to moons of the outer solar system, potentially habitable
   worlds tend to steal the spotlight — but if a team of scientists get
   their way, NASA may send a mission to a world that's certainly dead
   biologically, but far from it geologically.

   That world, Jupiter's incredibly volcanic moon Io, is the target of a
   mission that scientists are proposing to NASA for the third time, after
   a refocusing that they hope will make the project more appealing to the
   space agency. Known as the Io Volcano Observer (IVO), the mission would
   launch in 2026 and arrive at its target in 2031. There, it would, as
   the mission's new motto goes, "follow the heat" in order to understand
   how the gravitational tugs that the moon experiences trigger its
   extreme volcanic eruptions.

   "Tidal heating is a process that is happening throughout the cosmos,"
   Alfred McEwen, a planetary geologist at the University of Arizona and
   the principal investigator on the IVO mission, told Space.com. On icy
   moons like Jupiter's Europa and Saturn's Enceladus, tidal heating melts
   their interiors to form the massive oceans that scientists believe or
   know to be hiding under the surface, and the same phenomenon is also
   believed to play out in other solar systems. But on Io, it's truly a
   force to be reckoned with. "Io is the best place to study it because it
   is so pronounced there," McEwen said.

   No space agency has ever sent a dedicated mission to Io; most of what
   scientists know about the moon today comes from the Voyager mission
   through the outer solar system, the Galileo mission to Jupiter and
   ground-based observations. Before Voyager flew by, scientists didn't
   even realize the moon hosted active volcanic eruptions, which are now
   its most famous characteristic.

   But for now, the only new data scientists can gather about the moon
   comes from the ground, and telescopes can't get a detailed look at Io's
   dramatic surface activity. "I would love to see another mission to Io,"
   Julie Rathbun, a planetary scientist at the Planetary Science Institute
   who studies Io's volcanism but who isn't involved in the IVO proposal,
   told Space.com. "Getting a mission to Io is just really hard."

   The proposed IVO mission would fit NASA's Discovery program, the same
   budgetary class that has included the Kepler planet-hunting telescope,
   the InSight lander that has just begun its work on Mars and the Dawn
   mission to the asteroid belt. In part, that relatively low price is
   enabled by reusing instruments designed for other spacecraft, including
   for the upcoming Europa Clipper and European Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer
   missions, as well as for the European-Japanese BepiColombo mission
   currently en route to Mercury.

   The mission's flight design helps make the spacecraft's radiation
   exposure more manageable. "We make close flybys, but they're very fast
   and furious because the radiation is intense, so we get out," McEwen
   said. The IVO probe would make 10 such flybys over the course of four
   years, each carefully timed to the signals of tidal heating, which
   powers the volcanoes.

   Tidal heating is the result of the gravitational interaction of
   different planetary bodies. In Io's case, its gravity interacts with
   those of its giant neighbor Jupiter, plus its companion moons, Europa
   and Ganymede. Those interactions are particularly strong because the
   moons' orbits are synched up: for every once Ganymede orbits, Europa
   orbits twice and Io orbits four times.

   That clockwork relationship, which scientists call Laplace resonance,
   means Io experiences particularly severe tidal heating. But scientists
   don't know precisely what's inside Io — whether its heart is molten
   rock or solid — which makes it difficult to know how that tidal heating
   is actually working.

   Illusions and Music

   IVO would solve that. Its instruments will be able to determine whether
   Io hides a global magma ocean or whether its volcanoes rise from mostly
   solid rock. They will also be able to measure the composition and
   temperature of lava on the moon's surface, which scientists can use to
   determine how violent and how frequent the eruptions are.

   The implications wouldn't be limited to a distant moon but to all
   worlds that experience tidal heating. And IVO may teach us about our
   own world as well.

   Life on Earth has weathered five major mass extinctions, and each
   extinction corresponds with upticks in dramatic volcanic activity,
   McEwen said. Io may be the closest model to eruptions that cataclysmic,
   pouring out that much lava and volcanic gas. "Io provides very
   large-scale lava eruptions, very high temperatures, of a sort that was
   common in the early histories of the terrestrial planets," McEwen said.
   "If you want to understand it, it's really better to see it happen, and
   Io's the only place to go to do that."

   Volcanic eruptions on Earth are notoriously complicated; it's why
   scientists can't predict eruptions despite their best monitoring. But
   at Io, not only are eruptions simple, they are also prevalent.

   "It's like this gift — if you really want to understand volcanism,
   here's where you go," Rathbun said. "Io is almost volcanoes in their
   pure form."
