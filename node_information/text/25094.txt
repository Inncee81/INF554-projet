   The highlight of my trip to Prague!

   If you're an Apple fan, or computer/gadget fan then this is not to be

   As a software engineer and self confessed fan bwoy of Macs, I was most
   impressed with the collection of Apple computers, laptops and phones in

   Interesting

   Quite a full collection of Apple Computers right in a very center of
   Prague's Old Town - unexpected, but nice to dilute the medieval
   impressions of Prague with something of the modern world.

   Stare Mesto (Old Town)
   One of the oldest neighbourhoods in town represents
   the medieval heart of Prague. It’s no surprise it is
   bustling with tourists every time of day. Križovnický
   square, overlooking Charles Bridge with Prague Castle
   in the background, is probably the most beautiful
   square in the city. Its unique historical atmosphere
   of gothic houses and churches, cobblestone streets and
   squares, and stone towers blend together with the
   ...More
   modern era. A vast array of bars, restaurants, dance
   clubs, international brand shops, galleries and hotels
   bring life to the old city. With its charming and
   picturesque cobblestone streets, the nightlife and
   parties will surely be unforgettable.

What travellers are saying

   This can be a quick photo stop.
   One of Prague's hidden secrets is the art gallery on the 2nd floor of
   the Municipal Library.
   Doesn’t require more than a 5 minute stop.

   Stare Mesto (Old Town)
   One of the oldest neighbourhoods in town represents
   the medieval heart of Prague. It’s no surprise it is
   bustling with tourists every time of day. Križovnický
   square, overlooking Charles Bridge with Prague Castle
   in the background, is probably the most beautiful
   square in the city. Its unique historical atmosphere
   of gothic houses and churches, cobblestone streets and
   squares, and stone towers blend together with the
   ...More
   modern era. A vast array of bars, restaurants, dance
   clubs, international brand shops, galleries and hotels
   bring life to the old city. With its charming and
   picturesque cobblestone streets, the nightlife and
   parties will surely be unforgettable.

   Stare Mesto (Old Town)
   One of the oldest neighbourhoods in town represents
   the medieval heart of Prague. It’s no surprise it is
   bustling with tourists every time of day. Križovnický
   square, overlooking Charles Bridge with Prague Castle
   in the background, is probably the most beautiful
   square in the city. Its unique historical atmosphere
   of gothic houses and churches, cobblestone streets and
   squares, and stone towers blend together with the
   ...More
   modern era. A vast array of bars, restaurants, dance
   clubs, international brand shops, galleries and hotels
   bring life to the old city. With its charming and
   picturesque cobblestone streets, the nightlife and
   parties will surely be unforgettable.

   Smetana Hotel (formerly Pachtuv Palace) is one of Prague’s well-kept
   treasures with a prime location overlooking the iconic Charles Bridge
   and Prague Castle. Once a royal palace and the residence of the Pachta
   family since the 17th century, playing host to the likes of Mozart,
   Casanova and Wagner, Smetana Hotel retains a majestic glamour, with
   ornate décor, crystal chandeliers, and ceiling frescoes. Right here,
   Mozart himself composed his Six German Dances for the Count Pachta and
   his family. It is our pleasure to share with you that along with
   renovated guestrooms and suites, Smetana Hotel features an entirely
   reinvented dining destinations – Smetana Restaurant, Smetana Pizzeria
   and Café La Crème featuring local craft beer and exclusive wine, an
   array of international and Czech dishes, all with an emphasis on local
   products.

   Neighbourhood
   Staré Město (Old Town)
   One of the oldest neighbourhoods in town represents the medieval heart
   of Prague. It’s no surprise it is bustling with tourists every time of
   day. Križovnický square, overlooking Charles Bridge with Prague Castle
   in the background, is probably the most beautiful square in the city.
   Its unique historical atmosphere of gothic houses and churches,
   cobblestone streets and squares, and stone towers blend together with
   the modern era. A vast array of bars, restaurants, dance clubs,
   international brand shops, galleries and hotels bring life to the old
   city. With its charming and picturesque cobblestone streets, the
   nightlife and parties will surely be unforgettable.

   conditioning situation.
   Answer from 007BrianB

   This is a great hotel and the staff are wonderful. If possible get the
   balcony room on the front of the building 2nd floor for great fresh
   air. Last there in October and it was very warm weather and the hotel
   was fine.

   limousine service for 850 CZK / one way or 1500 CZK for round trip. In
   case of any questions, please do not hestiate to contact us anytime.

   Neighbourhood
   Staré Město (Old Town)
   One of the oldest neighbourhoods in town represents the medieval heart
   of Prague. It’s no surprise it is bustling with tourists every time of
   day. Križovnický square, overlooking Charles Bridge with Prague Castle
   in the background, is probably the most beautiful square in the city.
   Its unique historical atmosphere of gothic houses and churches,
   cobblestone streets and squares, and stone towers blend together with
   the modern era. A vast array of bars, restaurants, dance clubs,
   international brand shops, galleries and hotels bring life to the old
   city. With its charming and picturesque cobblestone streets, the
   nightlife and parties will surely be unforgettable.

   Fabulous gem of a hotel!
   "Superbly located on a quiet side street, but within close proximity to
   numerous attractions, bars and restaurants, this hotel makes a
   brilliant base to explore Prague. The staff are super friendly, and
   also super efficient - they organised airport transfers for me at both
   ends of my stay. The communal lounge is cosy and welcoming as is the
   small reception / bar area. Great breakfast in relaxed surroundings,
   spacious rooms with comfy beds. If it’s not fully booked then stay here
   when you come to Prague!…"

   city break
   "Stayed at Unitas Hotel. Nice breakfast, friendly staff, comfortable
   room. Long corridors which seemed longer after a day on your feet, but
   don'let that put you off. Prague is lovely, lots of history to see. The
   underground and tram was very convenient. Make sure you see the Castle
   and explore the town on that side of the river, Use the canal boat
   company to get a guided river ride, much nicer than the large boats.
   Old town and clock very interesting, lots of cafes to sit and people
   watch. Wenceslas Square was a little disappointing as it was basically
   an avenue of shops and not square but if one walks down the middle the
   flower beds and art works are nice.…"

   within 10-20 minute walk to Old Town (Astronomical clock), New Town
   (Wenceslas Square) and Charles Bridge. Beautiful decor offers peaceful
   surroundings on a quiet street with the church of Grey Sisters right
   beside the hotel. Plus the breakfast buffet is outstanding. Truly
   enjoyed our stay at the Unitas!…"
