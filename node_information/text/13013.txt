iPhone XS Max teardown reveals new sensor with more focus pixels

   Published Sep 27, 2018 | Lars Rehm

   [Apple-iPhone-Xs-back-camera-09122018.jpeg]

   When Apple announced the new iPhone models XS and XS Max the company
   told us that the camera's wide-angle module featured a larger sensor
   with 1.4 µm pixels compared to 1.22 µm on last year's iPhone X.

   Now a teardown performed by TechInsights has confirmed the new sensor,
   but has also revealed some additional detail about the wide-angle
   camera. The sensor is a stacked model provided by Sony on a 7.01 mm x
   5.79 mm (40.6 mm^2) sized die. This is 7.8 mm^2 more than the
   wide-angle camera sensor on the iPhones X and 8 Plus. The actual active
   area of the sensor is around 5.6 x 4.2 mm, which is likely to see it
   classed as a 1/2.5"-type chip.

     TechInsights engineers noticed an increased density of Focus Pixels

   In addition, the TechInsights engineers noticed an increased density of
   Focus Pixels. This means more regions of the sensor are available as
   autofocus points and should, at least in theory, improve autofocus
   performance in most light conditions and shooting situations. Focus
   Pixels is an Apple term for masked PDAF pixels which were first
   introduced in 2014 with the iPhone 6.

   TechInsight's teardown is still in progress, so we hope the team can
   provide some more information and also have a closer look at the
   camera's 2x tele-module, which on paper looks unchanged from last year,
   over the coming days.

   I have tested the XS intensively against the old iPhone X.
   I have come to the conclusion that the new camera delivers better image
   quality in almost any shooting conditions indeed: Better lowlight,
   better dynamic range, better AF, better video, better image stabilizer,
   better color rendition. The new wideangle lens helps for landscapes,
   indoor and street photography.

   Pretty impressed with the XS camera (I have the Max).
   Previously I had the X and that camera was good, but smart HDR and the
   newer sensor are a good improvement - more even tones, retaining
   highlights... Low light shots look excellent. Sadly Apple's aggressive
   noise reduction is still present but you have the option to shoot RAW
   with a third party app if need be.

   Yes if one compares the RAW output with jpeg then one wonders what
   Apple is smoking, why can't they dial back the over-processed approach
   like Pixel, Samsung (and Huawei are doing now) have done over the last
   2 years, which leads to more natural looking jpegs... come one Apple!

   I have the 512 Max in the gold color, and it is an improvement over my
   7+ that it replaced. I had the X for about a week, but I sent it back
   because I could not get used to the smaller screen. I no longer get all
   excited over the 'newest' version because I don't leverage the iPhone
   in the same way that I used to. Even so, I have always purchased the
   iPhones in their fully maxed-out version. The price is high and seems
   like Apple is setting the bar of profit to a level that may eventually
   diminish sales. As for the camera(s); they're okay for a phone based
   system, but nothing to get excited about.

   I still can't over excited about the picture taking capabilities of a
   phone. I use myiPhone to take pictures but it's never the quality thats
   lacking. It's the fact sometimes ittakes a picture when I want other
   times intakes them when it wants to.
   Sometimes when it comes out of my pocket its selected slow mo or square
   or something. What I can't get out of a phone is the ability to be
   ready when I need it, not the ability to create sudo portraits.

   There are always cons to the pros. More masked pixels also means less
   light captured. If every pixel was masked, the phone would capture half
   as much light.

   Sounds like they've also increased sensor size, and use a larger
   aperture. So this should net positive.

   Sure, increase the number of masked pixels from 1% to 2% and you
   capture about 1.01% less light, a completely undetectable difference.

   It's not undetectable. Banding has already been observed in the raw
   files, because the masking is not evenly distributed: certain pixels
   are literally half masked.

   Yeah, but these problems are not due to the sensor receiving less total
   light but either due to some small variation at the hardware level (for
   those rows having 'focus pixels') or the interpolation needed to ensure
   that the 'focus pixels' don't show up as spots in the image.

   Yes, if you want to convey the sense of tallness you should shoot
   vertically. Trouble is, most smartphone users haven't got enough
   discernment to know when to use their device horizontally or
   vertically. They shoot both pictures and video vertically because
   that's the way you hold the phone and visualize photos and videos.
   Dumb, I know, but true.

The iPhone 11 Pro Max gets the teardown treatment from iFixit

   As it does with nearly every Apple smartphone, tablet and computer that
   hits shelves, iFixit has torn down an iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro Max
   to reveal what technological goodies are hidden within. The teardown
   didn’t reveal too many surprises, overall, but a few interesting things
   did pop up.
   [iFixit_iPhone_11_Pro_Max_teardown_5.jpeg]
   From left to right: the iPhones XR, XS Max and 11 Pro Max.

   Before cracking into any of the devices, iFixit teamed up with Creative
   Electron to X-ray the phones before they were opened up. As seen above,
   there’s not a millimeter of free space within the frames and although
   the same general layout was used, there are a few noticeable
   differences between the iPhone 11 models and the iPhone XS models.
   Considering the iPhone 11 Pro Max is the most interesting of the
   devices from a photography standpoint, that’s the teardown we’ll be
   focusing on here, although the full teardown of the iPhone 11 is
   available on iFixit.

   Most notably, the iPhone 11 Pro Max uses a single-cell L-shaped
   battery, instead of two separate batteries found inside previous
   Plus/Max models. Apple also dropped down the logic board, presumably to
   make room for the much larger three-camera array.
   [iFixit_iPhone_11_Pro_Max_teardown_4.jpeg]

   In ‘Step 6,’ iFixit gets to the camera modules. The team at iFixit also
   had X-rays performed on the camera modules, which revealed the optical
   image stabilization on the wide and telephoto camera modules. According
   to the teardown, iFixit plans on doing a more detailed analysis of the
   camera unit, so when that goes live we’ll be sure to cover accordingly.
   [iFixit_iPhone_11_Pro_Max_teardown_3.jpeg]
   The black bars in the two larger camera modules are the OIS units.

   Moving on, the iFixit team digs into the nitty-gritty details of the
   logic board and all of the individual chips, memory units and sensors
   within.

   At ‘Step 13’ the battery gets some attention and iFixit reveals it was
   ‘pleasantly surprised to find some relatively repair-friendly
   features.’ The battery analysis also reveals the battery inside the
   iPhone 11 Pro Max ‘pumps out 3969 mAh at 3.79 V, for a total of 15.04
   Wh [...] a whopping 2.96 Wh more than the XS Max battery, and 1.52 Wh
   less than the Galaxy Note 10+ 5G battery.’ Of course, this increased
   capacity comes with a slight size increase. The battery inside the
   iPhone 11 Pro Max is 4.6mm thick and weighs 59.6g, which is 0.7mm
   thicker and 13g heavier than the dual-cell battery arrangement inside
   the iPhone XS Max.
   [iFixit_iPhone_11_Pro_Max_teardown_2.jpeg]

   The remainder of the teardown covers the bottom section of the devices,
   which includes speakers, microphones, charging ports, additional cables
   and more. iFixit gives the iPhone 11 Pro Max a repairability score of
   six out of ten, mostly due to the fact that if the back glass cracks
   the entire device essentially needs to be stripped away to repair it.

   360 photos and video can be very useful for certain applications (as
   well as having fun). The Vuze+ is an affordable 360 camera that
   supports both 2D and 3D (stereo vision) capture, and might be the best
   option for someone wanting to experiment with the 360 format.

   The EOS M6 Mark II renews Canon's commitment to making small,
   enthusiast-friendly APS-C mirrorless cameras. With 4K video, 30 fps Raw
   bursts and additional controls, it's a big step forward from its
   predecessor. And perhaps more interesting than the EOS 90D.

Kenko's new flash automatically moves its own head for optional bounce
lighting

   arent&enablejsapi=1

   Accessories manufacturer Kenko has introduced a flash unit that
   automatically rotates and tilts its own head to bounce its output from
   ceilings and walls to provide the ideal soft lighting. The Kenko
   AB600-R follows the lead of Canon’s Speedlite 470EX-AI by using motors
   to move its own head into the ideal position to suit the room and the
   subject, as well as the orientation of the camera.
   [5cf7967eafd1f.jpeg]

   The new flash unit measures the distance between itself and the
   subject, as well as between itself and the bounce surface, and
   automatically calculates the best angle from which to direct its light.
   The user can also position the head manually and have the flash unit
   rotate itself when the camera is turned to be used in a different
   orientation or at an angle.
   [5cf797aec968e.jpeg]

   Where the Kenko flash differs from the Canon model is that it has a
   guide number of 60m/197ft at ISO 100 (using the 200mm setting) and it
   offers radio control for wireless operation as well as optical. In
   wireless mode the unit can act as a master or slave, and can be
   controlled additionally via the WTR-1 wireless transceiver.
   [5cf797a736ddf.jpeg]

   The zoom head can track focal lengths of between 24mm and 200mm, and
   with the built-in diffuser lowered it will cover the angle of view of
   an 18mm lens. First and second curtain triggering options can be set,
   and strobe and high speed sync modes are also available.

   The head is powered by 4 AA batteries, but can also be powered by the
   BP-1 external battery pack and comes with a two-year guarantee. At the
   moment it comes with i-TTL compatibility for Nikon users (though B&H is
   advertising a Canon version – but showing the Nikon one), and costs
   $400 / £400. It is expected in stores in November. For more information
   see the Kenko website.

   Manufacturer information

New: AI Flash AB600-R

   An electronic flash with Auto Bounce and Angle Lock functions.

   The Kenko AB600-R is a high-power, 'Advanced Intelligence' flashgun
   which enables photographers to raise their game to another level,
   helping them automate the lighting process and get the best results
   every time.

   Amongst its many features, the Kenko AI flash AB600-R incorporates an
   'AI' Auto-Bounce function that takes care of the most difficult part in
   the shooting process: Bounce flash. By automatically calculating and
   moving to the optimum bounce angle, it enables the photographer to
   concentrate on the artistic part of the process, achieving better
   results in a more efficient way.

   3D Auto Bounce function - The auto-bounce function of the Kenko AI
   flash AB600-R automatically calculates the most appropriate angle of
   light-bounce from the wall (left or right side) or from the ceiling.
   With the help of the auto bounce function, the photographer can
   accomplish a perfect shot with just a single shutter release; no more
   wasting time thinking and testing the optimal light path during the
   photo session. This function is invaluable for wedding photographers or
   anyone shooting portraits to a tight schedule, when the photographer
   has no time for failure. Auto Lock function - Allows the photographer
   to adjust the desired bounce angle, based on the automatically
   calculated one, in manual mode and lets the system remember this angle
   when the camera is turned from horizontal to vertical format. This
   allows the photographer to really focus on the artistic part of the
   shooting process, like composition and interaction with the model,
   making the process of getting the ideal shot so much quicker and
   easier.

   Guide number: 60 - With a maximum guide number 60 (ISO 100 at 200mm),
   the Kenko AI flash AB600-R has all the power it needs to deal with wide
   range of scenes and situations.

   Master to slave flash angle remote control - The built-in radio
   transmitting and receiving unit allows a master flash to control the
   bounce angle of the slave flash remotely.

   Optical and radio (2.4GHz) wireless control - For off-camera and
   multiple flash shooting. Sync terminal is also supported.

   Auto and manual zoom adjustment - Light coverage angle equal to the
   18-200mm range (18mm achieved when used with the wide diffuser panel).
   External power supply - The optional BP-1 battery pack supports longer
   shooting sessions and delivers faster recycling times. Firmware updates
   - The Kenko AI Flash AB600-R firmware can be updated via micro USB
   port.
     * Zoom Range: 20-200mm (18mm using wide diffuser panel)
     * Flash Modes: i-TTL-BL / i-TTL / Manual / Strobe (1-200Hz), 1st/2nd
       curtain sync, high-speed sync
     * Power: 4x AA type batteries (alkaline / Nickel Metal Hydride), or
       external BP-1 battery pack
     * Recycling Time: Approx. 0.1-3.5 sec (using NiMH batteries)
     * AF beam assist: 29 point AF
     * Exposure adjustment: -3.0 to +3.0 stops (TTL mode), Full power to
       1/128 power (Manual mode)
     * Wireless Communication Systems: Optical and Radio (2.4GHz)
     * Bounce Mode: AI Auto bounce / Manual bounce (both with angle lock
       function)
     * External Connections: Micro USB (for firmware updates) / Sync
       terminal / External power supply
     * Dimensions (HxWxD): 196 x 80 x 62mm

   On the rare occasion that I use a flash I usually stick a large
   polystyrene coffee mug over the end of it. It works like the world's
   largest Omnibounce, only better, as there is more surface area.

   I have no idea who will buy this. As a full time corp event
   photographer, I find these types of flashes totally useless. And I
   doubt many amateurs have an interest. From the numbers of Canon's
   version, I think we can safely say this is dead in the water. Godox is
   killing it with USEFUL flashes. Long life battery. Magnetic attachments
   on the new and AFFORDABLE as well as powerful V1. Good luck competing
   with Godox.

   A counterfeit product is by definition branded as the original it is
   trying to counterfeit. Since this is Kenko, it is not a counterfeit. It
   is a third-party device- a very different thing.

   Guess I will need to buy six sets of batteries for each shoot to allow
   for the electronic drain moving the head. Or do I stick to three sets
   and aim it by hand just where I want it ?

   When a flash's power is really and actually specified with the guide
   number for its 200mm reflector setting, guide numbers have become
   completely meaningless.

   Liked. Would be too nice if GNs were always given for ISO 100, 50 mms
   FF equivalent.

   But then, if you're a flash manufacturer's shareholder, you will insist
   on GNs based on ISO 1000, 50 mms smartphone equivalent.

   They call it GN laundering.

   $400 is acceptable for a flash that automates this task.

   The big question is how well it does this job.

   I'm guessing the furthest surface it can find that's still within the
   power capability of the flash's output (furthest surface = softer
   light, but due to inverse square will reduce light intensity on
   subject, thus balance between softness and power).

   Barlowephoto - True, but I think this is intended for journalistic
   photographers and events photographers, who are more concerned with
   getting a publishable image than in getting one with great aesthetic
   value. These people need often to work very quickly, and this would
   save them time when rapidly alternating between portrait and landscape
   formats.

   For them, it might be useful, although I suspect most would choose the
   original Canon version for guaranteed compatibilty and (probably)
   greater reliability.

   Those of us concerned with aesthetics will use more sophisticated forms
   of artificial lighting, or (in my case) shoot only by ambient lighting.

   Entoman, in my opinion this is aimed just at beginners. Event
   Photographers need something fast to change directions and not to wait
   until this flash decides where to turn. Journalistic Photographers have
   the same needs, a quick change of the direction of the flash head.
   The Canon and i expect this one also are much to slow in operating. The
   video shown is in bright light with not too much flashlight needed.

iPhone XS Max teardown reveals new sensor with more focus pixels

   Published Sep 27, 2018 | Lars Rehm

   [Apple-iPhone-Xs-back-camera-09122018.jpeg]

   When Apple announced the new iPhone models XS and XS Max the company
   told us that the camera's wide-angle module featured a larger sensor
   with 1.4 µm pixels compared to 1.22 µm on last year's iPhone X.

   Now a teardown performed by TechInsights has confirmed the new sensor,
   but has also revealed some additional detail about the wide-angle
   camera. The sensor is a stacked model provided by Sony on a 7.01 mm x
   5.79 mm (40.6 mm^2) sized die. This is 7.8 mm^2 more than the
   wide-angle camera sensor on the iPhones X and 8 Plus. The actual active
   area of the sensor is around 5.6 x 4.2 mm, which is likely to see it
   classed as a 1/2.5"-type chip.

     TechInsights engineers noticed an increased density of Focus Pixels

   In addition, the TechInsights engineers noticed an increased density of
   Focus Pixels. This means more regions of the sensor are available as
   autofocus points and should, at least in theory, improve autofocus
   performance in most light conditions and shooting situations. Focus
   Pixels is an Apple term for masked PDAF pixels which were first
   introduced in 2014 with the iPhone 6.

   TechInsight's teardown is still in progress, so we hope the team can
   provide some more information and also have a closer look at the
   camera's 2x tele-module, which on paper looks unchanged from last year,
   over the coming days.

   I have tested the XS intensively against the old iPhone X.
   I have come to the conclusion that the new camera delivers better image
   quality in almost any shooting conditions indeed: Better lowlight,
   better dynamic range, better AF, better video, better image stabilizer,
   better color rendition. The new wideangle lens helps for landscapes,
   indoor and street photography.

   Pretty impressed with the XS camera (I have the Max).
   Previously I had the X and that camera was good, but smart HDR and the
   newer sensor are a good improvement - more even tones, retaining
   highlights... Low light shots look excellent. Sadly Apple's aggressive
   noise reduction is still present but you have the option to shoot RAW
   with a third party app if need be.

   Yes if one compares the RAW output with jpeg then one wonders what
   Apple is smoking, why can't they dial back the over-processed approach
   like Pixel, Samsung (and Huawei are doing now) have done over the last
   2 years, which leads to more natural looking jpegs... come one Apple!

   I have the 512 Max in the gold color, and it is an improvement over my
   7+ that it replaced. I had the X for about a week, but I sent it back
   because I could not get used to the smaller screen. I no longer get all
   excited over the 'newest' version because I don't leverage the iPhone
   in the same way that I used to. Even so, I have always purchased the
   iPhones in their fully maxed-out version. The price is high and seems
   like Apple is setting the bar of profit to a level that may eventually
   diminish sales. As for the camera(s); they're okay for a phone based
   system, but nothing to get excited about.

   I still can't over excited about the picture taking capabilities of a
   phone. I use myiPhone to take pictures but it's never the quality thats
   lacking. It's the fact sometimes ittakes a picture when I want other
   times intakes them when it wants to.
   Sometimes when it comes out of my pocket its selected slow mo or square
   or something. What I can't get out of a phone is the ability to be
   ready when I need it, not the ability to create sudo portraits.

   There are always cons to the pros. More masked pixels also means less
   light captured. If every pixel was masked, the phone would capture half
   as much light.

   Sounds like they've also increased sensor size, and use a larger
   aperture. So this should net positive.

   Sure, increase the number of masked pixels from 1% to 2% and you
   capture about 1.01% less light, a completely undetectable difference.

   It's not undetectable. Banding has already been observed in the raw
   files, because the masking is not evenly distributed: certain pixels
   are literally half masked.

   Yeah, but these problems are not due to the sensor receiving less total
   light but either due to some small variation at the hardware level (for
   those rows having 'focus pixels') or the interpolation needed to ensure
   that the 'focus pixels' don't show up as spots in the image.

   Yes, if you want to convey the sense of tallness you should shoot
   vertically. Trouble is, most smartphone users haven't got enough
   discernment to know when to use their device horizontally or
   vertically. They shoot both pictures and video vertically because
   that's the way you hold the phone and visualize photos and videos.

   360 photos and video can be very useful for certain applications (as
   well as having fun). The Vuze+ is an affordable 360 camera that
   supports both 2D and 3D (stereo vision) capture, and might be the best
   option for someone wanting to experiment with the 360 format.

The iPhone 11 Pro Max gets the teardown treatment from iFixit

   As it does with nearly every Apple smartphone, tablet and computer that
   hits shelves, iFixit has torn down an iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro Max
   to reveal what technological goodies are hidden within. The teardown
   didn’t reveal too many surprises, overall, but a few interesting things
   did pop up.
   [iFixit_iPhone_11_Pro_Max_teardown_5.jpeg]
   From left to right: the iPhones XR, XS Max and 11 Pro Max.

   Before cracking into any of the devices, iFixit teamed up with Creative
   Electron to X-ray the phones before they were opened up. As seen above,
   there’s not a millimeter of free space within the frames and although
   the same general layout was used, there are a few noticeable
   differences between the iPhone 11 models and the iPhone XS models.
   Considering the iPhone 11 Pro Max is the most interesting of the
   devices from a photography standpoint, that’s the teardown we’ll be
   focusing on here, although the full teardown of the iPhone 11 is
   available on iFixit.

   Most notably, the iPhone 11 Pro Max uses a single-cell L-shaped
   battery, instead of two separate batteries found inside previous
   Plus/Max models. Apple also dropped down the logic board, presumably to
   make room for the much larger three-camera array.
   [iFixit_iPhone_11_Pro_Max_teardown_4.jpeg]

   In ‘Step 6,’ iFixit gets to the camera modules. The team at iFixit also
   had X-rays performed on the camera modules, which revealed the optical
   image stabilization on the wide and telephoto camera modules. According
   to the teardown, iFixit plans on doing a more detailed analysis of the
   camera unit, so when that goes live we’ll be sure to cover accordingly.
   [iFixit_iPhone_11_Pro_Max_teardown_3.jpeg]
   The black bars in the two larger camera modules are the OIS units.

   Moving on, the iFixit team digs into the nitty-gritty details of the
   logic board and all of the individual chips, memory units and sensors
   within.

   At ‘Step 13’ the battery gets some attention and iFixit reveals it was
   ‘pleasantly surprised to find some relatively repair-friendly
   features.’ The battery analysis also reveals the battery inside the
   iPhone 11 Pro Max ‘pumps out 3969 mAh at 3.79 V, for a total of 15.04
   Wh [...] a whopping 2.96 Wh more than the XS Max battery, and 1.52 Wh
   less than the Galaxy Note 10+ 5G battery.’ Of course, this increased
   capacity comes with a slight size increase. The battery inside the
   iPhone 11 Pro Max is 4.6mm thick and weighs 59.6g, which is 0.7mm
   thicker and 13g heavier than the dual-cell battery arrangement inside
   the iPhone XS Max.
   [iFixit_iPhone_11_Pro_Max_teardown_2.jpeg]

   The remainder of the teardown covers the bottom section of the devices,
   which includes speakers, microphones, charging ports, additional cables
   and more. iFixit gives the iPhone 11 Pro Max a repairability score of
   six out of ten, mostly due to the fact that if the back glass cracks
   the entire device essentially needs to be stripped away to repair it.

   reviewSep 9, 2019 at 13:00

   360 photos and video can be very useful for certain applications (as
   well as having fun). The Vuze+ is an affordable 360 camera that
   supports both 2D and 3D (stereo vision) capture, and might be the best
   option for someone wanting to experiment with the 360 format.

   Canon EOS M6 II initial review: What's new and how it compares
   first impressionsAug 28, 2019 at 04:00

   The EOS M6 Mark II renews Canon's commitment to making small,
   enthusiast-friendly APS-C mirrorless cameras. With 4K video, 30 fps Raw
   bursts and additional controls, it's a big step forward from its
   predecessor. And perhaps more interesting than the EOS 90D.

Kenko's new flash automatically moves its own head for optional bounce
lighting

   arent&enablejsapi=1

   Accessories manufacturer Kenko has introduced a flash unit that
   automatically rotates and tilts its own head to bounce its output from
   ceilings and walls to provide the ideal soft lighting. The Kenko
   AB600-R follows the lead of Canon’s Speedlite 470EX-AI by using motors
   to move its own head into the ideal position to suit the room and the
   subject, as well as the orientation of the camera.
   [5cf7967eafd1f.jpeg]

   The new flash unit measures the distance between itself and the
   subject, as well as between itself and the bounce surface, and
   automatically calculates the best angle from which to direct its light.
   The user can also position the head manually and have the flash unit
   rotate itself when the camera is turned to be used in a different
   orientation or at an angle.
   [5cf797aec968e.jpeg]

   Where the Kenko flash differs from the Canon model is that it has a
   guide number of 60m/197ft at ISO 100 (using the 200mm setting) and it
   offers radio control for wireless operation as well as optical. In
   wireless mode the unit can act as a master or slave, and can be
   controlled additionally via the WTR-1 wireless transceiver.
   [5cf797a736ddf.jpeg]

   The zoom head can track focal lengths of between 24mm and 200mm, and
   with the built-in diffuser lowered it will cover the angle of view of
   an 18mm lens. First and second curtain triggering options can be set,
   and strobe and high speed sync modes are also available.

   The head is powered by 4 AA batteries, but can also be powered by the
   BP-1 external battery pack and comes with a two-year guarantee. At the
   moment it comes with i-TTL compatibility for Nikon users (though B&H is
   advertising a Canon version – but showing the Nikon one), and costs
   $400 / £400. It is expected in stores in November. For more information
   see the Kenko website.

   Manufacturer information

New: AI Flash AB600-R

   An electronic flash with Auto Bounce and Angle Lock functions.

   The Kenko AB600-R is a high-power, 'Advanced Intelligence' flashgun
   which enables photographers to raise their game to another level,
   helping them automate the lighting process and get the best results
   every time.

   Amongst its many features, the Kenko AI flash AB600-R incorporates an
   'AI' Auto-Bounce function that takes care of the most difficult part in
   the shooting process: Bounce flash. By automatically calculating and
   moving to the optimum bounce angle, it enables the photographer to
   concentrate on the artistic part of the process, achieving better
   results in a more efficient way.

   3D Auto Bounce function - The auto-bounce function of the Kenko AI
   flash AB600-R automatically calculates the most appropriate angle of
   light-bounce from the wall (left or right side) or from the ceiling.
   With the help of the auto bounce function, the photographer can
   accomplish a perfect shot with just a single shutter release; no more
   wasting time thinking and testing the optimal light path during the
   photo session. This function is invaluable for wedding photographers or
   anyone shooting portraits to a tight schedule, when the photographer
   has no time for failure. Auto Lock function - Allows the photographer
   to adjust the desired bounce angle, based on the automatically
   calculated one, in manual mode and lets the system remember this angle
   when the camera is turned from horizontal to vertical format. This
   allows the photographer to really focus on the artistic part of the
   shooting process, like composition and interaction with the model,
   making the process of getting the ideal shot so much quicker and
   easier.

   Guide number: 60 - With a maximum guide number 60 (ISO 100 at 200mm),
   the Kenko AI flash AB600-R has all the power it needs to deal with wide
   range of scenes and situations.

   Master to slave flash angle remote control - The built-in radio
   transmitting and receiving unit allows a master flash to control the
   bounce angle of the slave flash remotely.

   Optical and radio (2.4GHz) wireless control - For off-camera and
   multiple flash shooting. Sync terminal is also supported.

   Auto and manual zoom adjustment - Light coverage angle equal to the
   18-200mm range (18mm achieved when used with the wide diffuser panel).
   External power supply - The optional BP-1 battery pack supports longer
   shooting sessions and delivers faster recycling times. Firmware updates
   - The Kenko AI Flash AB600-R firmware can be updated via micro USB
   port.
     * Zoom Range: 20-200mm (18mm using wide diffuser panel)
     * Flash Modes: i-TTL-BL / i-TTL / Manual / Strobe (1-200Hz), 1st/2nd
       curtain sync, high-speed sync
     * Power: 4x AA type batteries (alkaline / Nickel Metal Hydride), or
       external BP-1 battery pack
     * Recycling Time: Approx. 0.1-3.5 sec (using NiMH batteries)
     * AF beam assist: 29 point AF
     * Exposure adjustment: -3.0 to +3.0 stops (TTL mode), Full power to
       1/128 power (Manual mode)
     * Wireless Communication Systems: Optical and Radio (2.4GHz)
     * Bounce Mode: AI Auto bounce / Manual bounce (both with angle lock
       function)
     * External Connections: Micro USB (for firmware updates) / Sync
       terminal / External power supply
     * Dimensions (HxWxD): 196 x 80 x 62mm

   On the rare occasion that I use a flash I usually stick a large
   polystyrene coffee mug over the end of it. It works like the world's
   largest Omnibounce, only better, as there is more surface area.

   I have no idea who will buy this. As a full time corp event
   photographer, I find these types of flashes totally useless. And I
   doubt many amateurs have an interest. From the numbers of Canon's
   version, I think we can safely say this is dead in the water. Godox is
   killing it with USEFUL flashes. Long life battery. Magnetic attachments
   on the new and AFFORDABLE as well as powerful V1. Good luck competing
   with Godox.

   A counterfeit product is by definition branded as the original it is
   trying to counterfeit. Since this is Kenko, it is not a counterfeit. It
   is a third-party device- a very different thing.

   "When a flash's power is really and actually specified with the guide
   number for its 200mm reflector setting, guide numbers have become
   completely meaningless."
   --
   Liked. Would be too nice if GNs were always given for ISO 100, 50 mms
   FF equivalent.

   But then, if you're a flash manufacturer's shareholder, you will insist
   on GNs based on ISO 1000, 50 mms smartphone equivalent.

   They call it GN laundering.

   I can't wait to see a review on this by DPR.

   $400 is acceptable for a flash that automates this task.

   The big question is how well it does this job.

   I'm guessing the furthest surface it can find that's still within the
   power capability of the flash's output (furthest surface = softer
   light, but due to inverse square will reduce light intensity on
   subject, thus balance between softness and power).

   Barlowephoto - True, but I think this is intended for journalistic
   photographers and events photographers, who are more concerned with
   getting a publishable image than in getting one with great aesthetic
   value. These people need often to work very quickly, and this would
   save them time when rapidly alternating between portrait and landscape
   formats.

   For them, it might be useful, although I suspect most would choose the
   original Canon version for guaranteed compatibilty and (probably)
   greater reliability.

   Those of us concerned with aesthetics will use more sophisticated forms
   of artificial lighting, or (in my case) shoot only by ambient lighting.

   Entoman, in my opinion this is aimed just at beginners. Event
   Photographers need something fast to change directions and not to wait
   until this flash decides where to turn. Journalistic Photographers have
   the same needs, a quick change of the direction of the flash head.
   The Canon and i expect this one also are much to slow in operating. The
   video shown is in bright light with not too much flashlight needed.
