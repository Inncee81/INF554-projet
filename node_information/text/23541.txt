     * 30 best Netflix shows for binge-watching over the holidays As
       Thanksgiving and the December holidays approach, families will be
       gathering during their vacation time. While many groups may elect
       to watch traditional holiday movies, family reunions could also
       double as larger water-cooler conversations, with family members
       catching up with each other's popular culture obsessions. There is
       more content on streaming services than ever before, and the number
       of streaming services is also increasing: November alone will bring
       two more such services, Apple TV Plus and Disney Plus. All of these
       competitors are aiming for the success of Netflix, the progenitor
       of the online streaming trend. Opposing services will face an
       uphill struggle just to catch up with the sheer volume of content
       that Netflix has to offer. Among Netflix's library are some of the
       top-rated television shows of all time, including Netflix originals
       such as "Black Mirror," Stranger Things," and "House of Cards."
       With other media conglomerates starting up their own answers to
       Netflix, the service will be losing some of its top hits in the
       coming years, giving subscribers limited time to binge-watch these
       programs. As such, Stacker has compiled some of the top-rated
       television shows and miniseries currently on the service. These are
       English-language TV shows and miniseries, with non-English language
       anime series being the only exception. The rankings presented in
       this list come from IMDb user rating data (as of October 2019)
       ordered from the 30th top-rated show to the first; ties were broken
       by vote count, and each show had to have at least 5,000 votes to be
       considered. Click on to see the best television shows to add to
       your Netflix list. You may also like: Fan campaigns that saved TV

       South Korea. On Wednesday, Nov. 13, 2019, North Korea's supreme
       decision-making institution has lashed out at planned U.S.-South
       Korean drills and warned that the United States will face "bigger
       threat and harsh suffering" if it ignores North Korean leader Kim
       Jong Un's end-of-year deadline to salvage the nuclear diplomacy.

     * 30 best Netflix shows for binge-watching over the holidays As
       Thanksgiving and the December holidays approach, families will be
       gathering during their vacation time. While many groups may elect
       to watch traditional holiday movies, family reunions could also
       double as larger water-cooler conversations, with family members
       catching up with each other's popular culture obsessions. There is
       more content on streaming services than ever before, and the number
       of streaming services is also increasing: November alone will bring
       two more such services, Apple TV Plus and Disney Plus. All of these
       competitors are aiming for the success of Netflix, the progenitor
       of the online streaming trend. Opposing services will face an
       uphill struggle just to catch up with the sheer volume of content
       that Netflix has to offer. Among Netflix's library are some of the
       top-rated television shows of all time, including Netflix originals
       such as "Black Mirror," Stranger Things," and "House of Cards."
       With other media conglomerates starting up their own answers to
       Netflix, the service will be losing some of its top hits in the
       coming years, giving subscribers limited time to binge-watch these
       programs. As such, Stacker has compiled some of the top-rated
       television shows and miniseries currently on the service. These are
       English-language TV shows and miniseries, with non-English language
       anime series being the only exception. The rankings presented in
       this list come from IMDb user rating data (as of October 2019)
       ordered from the 30th top-rated show to the first; ties were broken
       by vote count, and each show had to have at least 5,000 votes to be
       considered. Click on to see the best television shows to add to
       your Netflix list. You may also like: Fan campaigns that saved TV
