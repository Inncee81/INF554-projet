A3

   Séminaires Publications Membres

   Our group covers a remarkably broad range of topics, from Statistical
   Learning to Graph Mining and Reinforcement Learning. This allows us to
   be quite reactive to cope with new challenges raised by emerging
   applications of Machine Learning. It also makes it possible to study
   innovative combinations of learning methods for tackling complex
   problems.

AOC

   Séminaires Publications Membres

   The AOC team was issued in 2010 from two research domains of the former
   OCAD team: Combinatorial Optimization, and Parallel and Distributed
   Computing. The team is organized along three axes: optimization on
   graphs, mathematical programming and parallel and distributed
   computing. An interesting characteristic of the AOC team is that its
   expertise covers a broad spectrum of topics either horizontal (from
   graph theory to heuristics) or vertical (from algorithm design to
   detailed implementation). It is unusual in Europe and all over the
   world to find an equivalent spectrum.

CALIN

   Séminaires Publications Membres

   En 2010, le LIPN a décidé de créer une équipe de combinatoire, dans un
   effort pour rassembler des chercheurs venant de différents domaines de
   la combinatoire, que ce soit en informatique, mathématiques ou
   physique. Cette combinaison de différents savoirs et expériences offre
   un large panel de techniques pour attaquer des problèmes difficiles
   venus de chacune de ces communautés. Cette philosophie se retrouve dans
   l’acronyme de l’équipe, CALIN, pour Combinatoire, ALgorithmes et leurs
   INteractions.

LoVe

   Séminaires Publications Membres

   Our team is structured around two autonomous axes of research :
     * Types, models and theory of programming
     * Specification, and modular and distributed verification

RCLN

   Séminaires Publications Membres

   The RCLN team is interested in the expressive power of natural language
   and its impact on knowledge representation. This work includes
   fundamental and applied research with an original combination of skills
   in natural language processing and knowledge engineering. The team's
   project aims to articulate knowledge discovery and retrieval to be
   applied on semantic web technologies.
