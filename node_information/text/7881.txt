The Value of Luminosity Data as a Proxy for Economic Statistics

Xi Chen, William D. Nordhaus

   NBER Working Paper No. 16317
   Issued in August 2010
   NBER Program(s):The Environment and Energy Program, The Industrial
   Organization Program, The Productivity, Innovation, and
   Entrepreneurship Program

   One of the pervasive issues in social and environmental research has
   been to improve the quality of socioeconomic data in developing
   countries. Because of the shortcoming of standard data sources, the
   present study examines luminosity (measures of nighttime lights) as a
   proxy for standard measures of output. The paper compares output and
   luminosity at the country levels and at the 1° x 1° grid-cell levels
   for the period 1992-2008. The results are that luminosity has very
   little value added for countries with high-quality statistical systems.
   However, it may be useful for countries with the lowest statistical
   grades, particularly for war-torn countries with no recent population
   or economic censuses. The results also indicate that luminosity has
   more value added for economic density estimates than for time-series
   growth rates.

Summer Institute Social Security Panel Focuses
on Recent Trends in Fertility in the United States

   The U.S. fertility rate — an important driver of the long-term
   financial health of the Social Security system — has trended downward
   since the 1960s, and fallen noticeably in the last decade. Academic
   researchers joined experts from the Social Security Administration to
   discuss these trends and their implications at the 2019 NBER Summer
   Institute. The panel was introduced by NBER President James Poterba.

Benefits of Early Exposure to Professional Work

   Engineering majors exposed to professional work early in their college
   careers take more engineering courses and are more likely to switch to
   higher-income subfields within engineering, a field experiment by Kevin
   J. Boudreau and Matt Marx shows. The effects were most pronounced for
   lower-income students.

   stance of U.S. monetary policy, regardless of whether those changes

With Sales of Fair Trade-Certified Imports Soaring,
Studies Examine Who in the Production Chain Benefits

   [nunnfigure3.jpg]
   Consumers in developed countries who want to help lift producers in
   developing countries out of poverty have shown a willingness to pay
   significantly higher prices for Fair Trade-certified products – coffee
   in particular. In the current issue of the free, quarterly NBER
   Reporter, a researcher discusses what's been learned about who benefits
   most, and least. This edition of The Reporter also includes articles by
   NBER researchers about the work of NBER Economic Fluctuations and
   Growth Program affiliates, the labor market effects of the business
   cycle, the challenges posed by China's aging population, and the
   viability of the sustainable investing proposition.

Examination of Returns to U.S. Government Programs
Shows Investment in Low-Income Children Most Beneficial

   [w26144.jpg]

   U.S. government programs that provide early childhood health
   interventions reduce subsequent Medicaid-financed health care needs and
   increase future earnings and tax payments, improving government
   finances in the long run, research featured in the September edition of
   The NBER Digest shows. Other studies in this edition of the free,
   monthly Digest document reduction in the percentage of black teachers
   in Southern schools that desegregated, explore the influence of
   early-career research experience, show that borrowers who are aware of
   their FICO scores are less likely to be overdue on loan payments, gauge
   the impacts of R&D tax credits, and explore the contemporary relevance
   of the Phillips curve.

Bulletin on Health

Winter Deaths Averted by Lower Home Heating Prices

   [w25681.jpg]
   The summer issue of the Bulletin on Health features a study of the
   effects of heating costs on deaths from health conditions that are
   worsened by cold weather. Researchers find that households reduce their
   home energy use when prices increase, but not so much as to fully
   offset the price increase, so they are still exposed to higher energy
   bills. They demonstrate that higher heating prices also increase
   mortality rates, especially for cardiovascular and respiratory causes
   of death, and in lower-income counties. Their estimates imply that the
   lowered price of heating due to shale natural gas production and other
   factors in the late 2000s averted 11,000 winter deaths per year in
   areas that relied on this heating energy source. Also featured in the
   summer issue of the Bulletin on Health are studies of the effects of
   California’s change in vaccine laws on vaccination and medical
   exemption rates, and the distributional impact of penicillin’s
   introduction on mortality in Italy following World War II.

The Insurance and Liquidity Value
of Social Security Survivors Benefits?

   [w25586.jpg]

   In 2015, the Social Security program paid over $95 billion in survivors
   benefits to 4.2 million surviving spouses. Research that is the first
   to explore the protective role of survivors benefit receipt against the
   short-run financial consequences of a spousal death finds that
   attaining benefit eligibility is associated with a 34-percentage point
   increase in Social Security receipt and a 3.1-percentage point decline
   in labor force participation. Also summarized in this first issue of
   the free Bulletin on Retirement and Disability: research that estimates
   the total value of Great Recession-induced disability insurance (DI)
   awards and a study of the effects of DI awards on the financial
   outcomes of applicants.

Summer Institute Social Security Panel Focuses
on Recent Trends in Fertility in the United States

   The U.S. fertility rate — an important driver of the long-term
   financial health of the Social Security system — has trended downward
   since the 1960s, and fallen noticeably in the last decade. Academic
   researchers joined experts from the Social Security Administration to
   discuss these trends and their implications at the 2019 NBER Summer
   Institute. The panel was introduced by NBER President James Poterba.

Benefits of Early Exposure to Professional Work

   Engineering majors exposed to professional work early in their college
   careers take more engineering courses and are more likely to switch to
   higher-income subfields within engineering, a field experiment by Kevin
   J. Boudreau and Matt Marx shows. The effects were most pronounced for
   lower-income students.

U.S. Monetary Policy and International Bond Markets

   Analyzing data starting in the early 1990s, Simon Gilchrist, Vivian
   Yue, and Egon Zakrajšek find that yields on dollar-denominated
   sovereign debt are highly responsive to unanticipated changes in the
   stance of U.S. monetary policy, regardless of whether those changes
   represent conventional or unconventional policies.

With Sales of Fair Trade-Certified Imports Soaring,
Studies Examine Who in the Production Chain Benefits

   [nunnfigure3.jpg]
   Consumers in developed countries who want to help lift producers in
   developing countries out of poverty have shown a willingness to pay
   significantly higher prices for Fair Trade-certified products – coffee
   in particular. In the current issue of the free, quarterly NBER
   Reporter, a researcher discusses what's been learned about who benefits
   most, and least. This edition of The Reporter also includes articles by
   NBER researchers about the work of NBER Economic Fluctuations and
   Growth Program affiliates, the labor market effects of the business
   cycle, the challenges posed by China's aging population, and the
   viability of the sustainable investing proposition.

Examination of Returns to U.S. Government Programs
Shows Investment in Low-Income Children Most Beneficial

   [w26144.jpg]

   U.S. government programs that provide early childhood health
   interventions reduce subsequent Medicaid-financed health care needs and
   increase future earnings and tax payments, improving government
   finances in the long run, research featured in the September edition of
   The NBER Digest shows. Other studies in this edition of the free,
   monthly Digest document reduction in the percentage of black teachers
   in Southern schools that desegregated, explore the influence of
   early-career research experience, show that borrowers who are aware of
   their FICO scores are less likely to be overdue on loan payments, gauge
   the impacts of R&D tax credits, and explore the contemporary relevance
   of the Phillips curve.

Bulletin on Health

Winter Deaths Averted by Lower Home Heating Prices

   [w25681.jpg]
   The summer issue of the Bulletin on Health features a study of the
   effects of heating costs on deaths from health conditions that are
   worsened by cold weather. Researchers find that households reduce their
   home energy use when prices increase, but not so much as to fully
   offset the price increase, so they are still exposed to higher energy
   bills. They demonstrate that higher heating prices also increase
   mortality rates, especially for cardiovascular and respiratory causes
   of death, and in lower-income counties. Their estimates imply that the
   lowered price of heating due to shale natural gas production and other
   factors in the late 2000s averted 11,000 winter deaths per year in
   areas that relied on this heating energy source. Also featured in the
   summer issue of the Bulletin on Health are studies of the effects of
   California’s change in vaccine laws on vaccination and medical
   exemption rates, and the distributional impact of penicillin’s
   introduction on mortality in Italy following World War II.

The Insurance and Liquidity Value
of Social Security Survivors Benefits?

   [w25586.jpg]

   In 2015, the Social Security program paid over $95 billion in survivors
   benefits to 4.2 million surviving spouses. Research that is the first
   to explore the protective role of survivors benefit receipt against the
   short-run financial consequences of a spousal death finds that
   attaining benefit eligibility is associated with a 34-percentage point
   increase in Social Security receipt and a 3.1-percentage point decline
   in labor force participation. Also summarized in this first issue of
   the free Bulletin on Retirement and Disability: research that estimates
   the total value of Great Recession-induced disability insurance (DI)
   awards and a study of the effects of DI awards on the financial
   outcomes of applicants.
