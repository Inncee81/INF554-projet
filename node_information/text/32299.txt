For Buyers

   An ad exchange should never come between buyers and sellers. Index
   Exchange creates a fast and frictionless bridge for transacting deals
   in real time that enhances the relationship between the two. Strategic
   buyers are integral to a competitive marketplace. We believe our valued
   demand partners are best served by an independent ad exchange with no
   competing buy side business.

Key Benefits

     * Transparent
       Index Exchange never levies harmful hidden buy side fees that
       reduce working media.
     * Neutral
       Index Exchange has no buy side business to compete with our
       valuable demand partners. Our sole focus is building strong and
       fast pipes to facilitate transactions.
     * Flexible
       New ad technology moves lightning fast for buyers, and we know that
       moving fast to support new sizes and formats is critical to our
       mutual success.
     * Quality
       Every URL is individually screened to ensure it adheres to the
       highest quality standards.

   "Index Exchange provides premium supply with no buy side fees,
   recommending and monitoring our deals to ensure they remain competitive
   with the open market."
   Geoffrey Litwer, Media Director at Publicis Health Media

Life @ Index

   IFRAME: https://player.vimeo.com/video/304900715?app_id=122963

   Step foot into any of Index Exchange’s offices around the globe, and
   you’ll be walking into a diverse group of industry experts, pioneers
   and up-and-comers who are deeply energized by our company’s vision.

   While it may be trite, it’s true — the culture at Index Exchange is
   like that of a family. As a group of people dedicated to doing business
   honestly and transparently, colleagues feel connected and supported as
   they work towards both a common business goal and personal life
   achievements.

   Our offices and organization support a communal environment where
   colleagues can feel comfortable collaborating with a variety of teams,
   experience levels and backgrounds. Each member of the Index team is
   expected to take ownership and contribute from day one, as our business
   and industry is too-fast moving for red tape or bureaucracy. We’re
   always open to new ideas – whether focused on specific partners, teams
   or the company as a whole.
