Avid Blames Google for Mac Pro Crashes

   Avid confirms that the crash and failure to reboot of Mac Pros across
   Hollywood was nothing to do with its software, with the blame falling
   on a Google Chrome update.

   UPDATE 9/25: Avid has released a statement confirming that the root
   cause of Mac Pros crashing this week was in fact a Chrome update
   released by Google. The update includes a bug that "damages the file
   system on macOS machines." Information relating to the bug can be found
   on the Google Chrome Help community website.

   Avid CEO Jeff Rosica stated, "Avid is pleased that the reboot issue
   facing some customers is solved and while Avid products are not the
   root cause, we're keeping an intense focus on bringing all of our
   customers back online and back to work. Over the past 36 hours, the
   deep dive of due diligence working closely with Apple, PACE and other
   partners exhausted all options and we've landed in the right place as
   quickly as possible. We owe our special thanks to Avid's customer and
   user community for their typically strong show of support at this time,
   especially to those who welcomed our engineers into their studios to
   troubleshoot."

   Original Story 9/24:
   The combination of a Mac Pro and Avid's Media Composer video-editing
   software is a common one across Hollywood. However, since yesterday
   it's been causing Mac Pros to slowly crash and refuse to reboot.

   As Variety reports, the movie and TV industry in Los Angeles is
   "sweating" today because the trashcan Mac Pros they rely on to work are
   failing and nobody knows why yet. The Macs are refusing to reboot, with
   the Avid Editors of Facebook group urging people not to turn off their
   Macs as the tweet below show.

     BIG ALERT tonight regarding #Apple, and #MacOS running on the can.
     DO NOT SHUT DOWN!! #AvidEditors #Avid Apparently something is
     corrupting one of the UNIX root level folders. Back up everything,
     not just on the servers is you are in a connected environment. Refer
     to below FB pg pic.twitter.com/iLlfHVRfmp

   In a statement, Avid said it's "aware of the reboot issue affecting
   Apple Mac Pro devices running some Avid products, which arose late
   yesterday. The company also released the video included below to help
   explain the situation and offer some guidance while the problem is
   identified and solved:

   One way to test if your Mac Pro is affected is to go into System
   Preferences and then Users & Groups. If you know your account is set as
   admin, but the preferences only show you as a regular user, your system
   has been compromised and will likely fail to reboot if shut down.

       Editors' Rating: good 10.03.2019

       Bottom Line: The Epson WorkForce WF-110 is a compact and light
       low-volume mobile printer that produces quality output for business
       travelers.

       Bottom Line: Nintendo Switch Online is a necessary subscription if
       you want to play Switch games on the internet. It has classic NES
       and SNES games, as well as Tetris 99, but the way it implements its
       various features can be frustrating.
     * Olympus Tough TG-6

       Editors' Rating: excellent 10.03.2019
       at
       Bottom Line: The Olympus Tough TG-6 is a modest update to our
       favorite underwater point-and-shoot camera thanks to its tough
       design, bright lens, and excellent macro capabilities.
     * HTC Vive Cosmos

       Editors' Rating: good 10.03.2019
       at
       Bottom Line: The HTC Vive Cosmos VR headset is a technically
       impressive improvement on the original Vive, but it's very
       expensive and you still have to deal with a cable.
     * pCloud
       pCloud
       Editors' Rating: good 10.02.2019
       at
       Bottom Line: Cloud storage and syncing service pCloud is reasonably
       priced, supports all major platforms, and offers an extra secure
       option, but it's not as integrated as Google Drive and OneDrive nor
       does it offer as many features.
     * Asustor AS5304T

       Editors' Rating: excellent 10.02.2019
       at
       Bottom Line: The Asustor AS5304T is a powerful four-bay NAS device
       equipped with top-notch hardware and a generous catalog of apps.
     * Bose Portable Home Speaker Bose Portable Home Speaker
       Editors' Rating: good 10.02.2019
       at
       Bottom Line: The Bose Portable Home Speaker delivers Amazon Alexa
       and Google Assistant voice control with powerful wireless audio for
       its size, if not its price.
     * Apple iPhone 11
       Apple iPhone 11
       Editors' Rating: excellent 10.02.2019
       at
       Bottom Line: The iPhone 11 offers solid camera performance and
       power to spare for a relatively reasonable price. It isn't
       exciting, but it's a good replacement for older iPhones.
     * Apple iPhone 11 Pro
       Apple iPhone 11 Pro
       Editors' Rating: excellent 10.02.2019
       at
       Bottom Line: The pricey iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max bring more
       cameras, longer battery life, and better LTE capabilities to
       Apple's flagship phone line.
     * Sticky Password Premium

       Editors' Rating: good 10.01.2019
       at
       Bottom Line: Sticky Password Premium does everything you'd expect
       from a password manager, though it lacks advanced features such as
       digital inheritance and password breach checks. If you choose its
       secure no-cloud Wi-Fi sync, your passwords never leave your home
       network.
     * Microsoft Teams
       Microsoft Teams
       Editors' Rating: excellent 10.01.2019
       at
       Bottom Line: Microsoft Teams provides features galore, including
       tight connectivity with Office 365. It's a great team messaging app
       if your organization is a Microsoft shop.
     * GoPro Hero8 Black

       Editors' Rating: excellent 10.01.2019
       at
       Bottom Line: The GoPro Hero8 Black is the company's best action
       camera to date, offering class-leading stabilization and video
       quality in a rugged, waterproof body.

       4)
       10.01.2019
       at
       Bottom Line: Atelier Ryza is a promising Japanese RPG that focuses
       on the joy of adventure and delivers satisfying combat and a robust
       item-crafting system to keep you invested.
     * Samsung Galaxy Fold

       Editors' Rating: good 10.01.2019
       at
       Bottom Line: Samsung gets points for innovation with its Galaxy
       Fold. You can use this pricey device as a phone or a tablet, but it
       doesn't quite satisfy in either regard.
     * Philips Brilliance 499P9H

       Editors' Rating: excellent 09.30.2019
       at
       Bottom Line: The Philips Brilliance 499P9H offers a winning
       combination of a gigantic, ultra-wide curved screen—shining with a
       bright, vivid image—and extras like a Windows Hello-compatible
       webcam and a built-in KVM switch.
     * Cooler Master MM710 Gaming Mouse

       Editors' Rating: good 09.30.2019
       at
       Bottom Line: Cooler Master's MM710 esports mouse is one of the
       lightest things on padded feet for serious twitch gamers, but the
       compact, minimalist design is definitely not for everyone.
