About us

History

   The Economist was established in 1843 by James Wilson, a hatmaker from
   the small Scottish town of Hawick, to campaign against the
   protectionist Corn Laws. The tariffs were repealed in 1846 but the
   newspaper lived on as “a political, literary, and general newspaper”,
   never abandoning its belief in free trade, internationalism and minimum
   interference by government, especially in the affairs of the market.
   (It did, however, abandon the Oxford comma.)

   The Corn Laws, which by taxing and restricting imports of grain made
   bread expensive and starvation common, were bad for Britain. Free
   trade, in Wilson’s view, was good for everyone. Wilson believed “that
   reason is given to us to sit in judgment over the dictates of our
   feelings.” Reason convinced him in particular that Adam Smith was
   right, and that through its invisible hand the market benefited
   profit-seeking individuals and society alike. Wilson was himself a
   manufacturer and wanted especially to influence “men of business”.
   Accordingly, he insisted that all the arguments and propositions put
   forward in his paper should be based on fact and rigour. That was why
   he called it The Economist.

   Though Wilson founded The Economist, the newspaper’s greatest editor
   was his son-in-law, Walter Bagehot (pronounced BAJ-ut), who was the
   paper’s third editor, from 1861 to 1877. He broadened the range of the
   paper into politics; he was also responsible for greatly strengthening
   the interest in America that The Economist has always shown. The
   paper’s influence grew under his editorship. One British foreign
   secretary, Lord Granville, said that whenever he felt uncertain, he
   liked to wait and see what the next issue of The Economist had to say.
   A later admirer of Bagehot’s was Woodrow Wilson, president of the
   United States from 1913 to 1921.

   Another remarkable editor was appointed in 1922: Walter Layton, whose
   achievement, in the words of The Economist’s historian, Ruth Dudley
   Edwards in her book “The Pursuit of Reason”— was to ensure that the
   paper was “read widely in the corridors of power abroad as well as at
   home”, a reputation it continues to enjoy today. His successor,
   Geoffrey Crowther, developed and improved the coverage of foreign
   affairs (especially with regard to America) and business.

   From its earliest days, The Economist had looked abroad, both for
   subjects to write about and for readers. Even in the 1840s it had
   subscribers in continental Europe and America. By 1938 half its sales
   were outside Britain. Crowther’s great innovation was to start a
   section devoted to American affairs, which he did just after the
   Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour in December 1941. The “American
   Survey” section (renamed “United States” in 1997) was aimed not at
   Americans but at British readers who, Crowther believed, needed to know
   more about their new allies. In time, however, it earned a following in
   the United States too.

   For most of its existence The Economist was content with a small
   readership. When Bagehot stood down as editor, circulation was just
   3,700, and by 1920 it had climbed to only 6,000. After the second world
   war it rose rapidly, but from a base of barely 18,000. When Crowther
   left it stood at only 55,000, not reaching 100,000 until 1970. Today
   circulation is 1.5m, more than four-fifths of it outside Britain.
   Subscribers in the United States and Canada account for 57% of the
   total.

   In recent decades the paper has added sections devoted to Europe, Asia,
   Latin America, China, and science and technology. It has also expanded
   coverage of books, arts and culture, and introduced columns on
   financial markets (Buttonwood), business (Schumpeter), Asian politics
   (Banyan) and Latin America (Bello).

   The Economist has also been active in its pursuit of new readers on
   digital platforms. The newspaper started publishing online in 1996, and
   has more recently launched a daily news app (Espresso), a bilingual
   English-Chinese product (Global Business Review) and a virtual-reality
   app (Economist VR). Economist Radio produces several podcasts a week,
   and Economist Films produces short- and long-form video. The
   social-media department maintains widely followed accounts on Facebook,
   Twitter, LinkedIn, Snapchat, LINE, Medium and other social networks.

Frequently asked questions

   Why does The Economist call itself a newspaper?

   When James Wilson published the prospectus for The Economist, a new
   periodical he planned to launch, he described it as “a weekly paper, to
   be published every Saturday”. To modern eyes the 19th-century
   black-and-white incarnation of The Economist is clearly a newspaper,
   and it looked very similar until the middle of the 20th century. The
   red logo appeared for the first time in 1959, the first colour cover in
   1971, and it was only in 2001 that full colour was introduced on all
   inside pages. By the time the transformation from newspaper to magazine
   format had been completed, the habit of referring to ourselves as “this
   newspaper” had stuck.
   Is The Economist left- or right-wing?

   Neither. The Economist’s starting point is that government should only
   remove power and wealth from individuals when it has an excellent
   reason to do so. When The Economist opines on new ideas and policies,
   it does so on the basis of their merits, not of who supports or opposes
   them. The result is a position that is neither right nor left but a
   blend of the two, drawing on the classical liberalism of the 19th
   century and coming from what we like to call the radical centre.
   Where is your head office?

   The modern, global version of The Economist was created in “the tower”,
   as journalists refer to the tallest of the three brutalist concrete
   buildings that make up The Economist Plaza in St James’s Street.
   Commissioned by The Economist and designed by Alison and Peter
   Smithson, the tower was our home from 1964 until the summer of 2017,
   when we moved into the Adelphi, a 1930s Art Deco office block on the
   Embankment.
   How has your logo evolved?

   The corporate logotype of The Economist has evolved from the gothic
   lettering used on the cover of the first issue, published in 1843, to
   the box device designed in 1959 by Reynolds Stone, a British engraver
   and typographer. It now incorporates a font from The Economist
   Typefamily, a typeface created specifically for our use.

Corporate structure

Ownership

   The Economist has been editorially independent since it was founded in
   September 1843 to take part “in a severe contest between intelligence,
   which presses forward, and an unworthy, timid ignorance obstructing our
   progress.”

   The share capital of The Economist Newspaper Limited, The Economist
   Groups parent company, is divided into ordinary shares, “A” special
   shares, “B” special shares and trust shares. The company is private and
   none of the shares is listed. Its articles of association also state
   that no individual or company can own or control more than 50% of its
   total share capital, and that no single shareholder may exercise more
   than 20% of voting rights exercised at a general meeting of the
   company.

   Ordinary shares are principally held by employees, past employees,
   founding members of the company and, more recently, by Exor NV. The
   ordinary shareholders are not entitled to participate in the
   appointment of directors, but in most other respects rank pari passu
   with the other shareholders. The transfer of ordinary shares must be
   approved by the Board of directors.

   The “A” special shares are held by individual shareholders including
   the Cadbury, Rothschild, Schroder and other family interests as well as
   a number of staff and former staff.

   The “B” special shares are all held by Exor which holds 43.4% of the
   total share capital of the company excluding the trust shares. Exor
   purchased the majority of its shareholding from Pearson plc in October
   2015.

   The trust shares are held by trustees, whose consent is needed for
   certain corporate activities, including the transfer of “A” special and
   “B” special shares. The rights attaching to the trust shares provide
   for the continued independence of the ownership of the company and the
   editorial independence of The Economist. Apart from these rights, they
   do not include the right to vote, receive dividends or have any other
   economic interest in the company. The appointments of the editor of The
   Economist and of the chairman of the company are subject to the
   approval of the trustees.

   The general management of the business of the company is under the
   control of the Board of directors. There are 13 seats allowable on the
   Board, seven of which may be appointed by holders of the “A” special
   shares and six by the holders of the “B” special shares.

Editorial practices

Philosophy

   The Economist has been published since September 1843 to take part “in
   a severe contest between intelligence, which presses forward, and an
   unworthy, timid ignorance obstructing our progress”. This mission
   continues to guide our coverage: we publish it every week in the
   newspaper.

   Our readers expect us to keep them well informed about the world. So
   each week in print and each day online we provide a carefully selected
   global mix of stories. Our news priorities are reflected in the
   sections that we include in the paper every week: these are both
   geographical (Britain, Europe, the United States, the Americas, China,
   Asia, Middle East and Africa, International) and thematic (Business,
   Finance and economics, Science and technology, Books and arts). By
   systematically sifting news in these categories we aim to ensure that
   readers miss nothing important. In addition, through leaders, briefings
   and special reports we strive to identify ideas and trends that will
   shape global developments—and keep us and our readers engaged in the
   “severe contest”. This underpins all our editorial output, across
   digital outputs and sister publications.

   Our stories offer a distinctive blend of news, based on facts, and
   analysis, incorporating The Economist’s perspective.

   We do not attach ourselves to any political party. Our public agenda is
   liberal in the classical sense. We have supported free trade ever since
   our foundation in 1843 when we opposed Britain’s corn laws, which
   sought to keep the price of grain high by limiting imports. We have
   continued to advocate bold policies in favour of individual freedoms,
   such as same-sex marriage and legalisation of drugs, regardless of
   whether they are politically popular, in the belief that the force of
   argument will eventually prevail.

Ethics

   The Economist strives for the highest ethical standards. Our approach
   falls under two headings:

   Core principles
     * We should be honest, fair and fearless in gathering, reporting and
       interpreting information.
     * We are accountable to our readers, listeners, viewers and each
       other.
     * We steadfastly uphold our editorial independence.
     * We use objective data and research to inform our journalism.
     * We apply classical liberal values transparently in our reporting
       and analysis.
     * We are transparent about conflicts of interest (see below). As an
       anonymous newspaper, we have to be especially beyond reproach.

   Conflicts of interest
     * The editor-in-chief sets clear rules on conflicts of interest.
       These are reviewed and re-circulated periodically. Journalists know
       that the penalty for non-observance of the rules can be dismissal.
     * Our journalists should disclose any possible conflicts of interest,
       such as beneficial holdings, directorships, and freelance
       engagements. The editor-in-chief keeps a registry of journalists’
       interests, and updates it annually.
     * Any journalist wishing to accept a trip offered by a government,
       company or other entity must obtain approval by a senior editor.
       Such trips should be rare. They should be limited to press trips
       offered for travel pieces, with a disclosure printed in the
       resulting content, or the case where a trip cannot be taken at our
       own expense, such as travel into a warzone.
     * Journalists arriving at The Economist from a partisan political job
       will not be allowed to write about policy or politics in the
       country in which they held that job for some time. Journalists
       covering politics or policy cannot contribute money or help to a
       political party or organisation in the country they are working in.
     * Facilitation payments to expedite or secure a government action are
       not acceptable.

Author anonymity

   Most newspapers and magazines use bylines to identify the journalists
   who write their articles. The Economist, however, does not. Its
   articles lack bylines and its journalists remain anonymous. Why?

   Part of the answer is that The Economist is maintaining a historical
   tradition that other publications have abandoned. Leaders are often
   unsigned in newspapers, but everywhere else there has been rampant
   byline inflation (to the extent that some papers run picture bylines on
   ordinary news stories). Historically, many publications printed
   articles without bylines or under pseudonyms to give individual writers
   the freedom to assume different voices and to enable early newspapers
   to give the impression that their editorial teams were larger than they
   really were. The first few issues of The Economist were, in fact,
   written almost entirely by James Wilson, the founding editor, though he
   wrote in the first-person plural.

   But having started off as a way for one person to give the impression
   of being many, anonymity has since come to serve the opposite function
   at The Economist: it allows many writers to speak with a collective
   voice. Leaders are discussed and debated each week in meetings that are
   open to all members of the editorial staff. Journalists often
   co-operate on articles. And some articles are heavily edited.
   Accordingly, articles are often the work of The Economist’s hive mind,
   rather than of a single author. The main reason for anonymity, however,
   is a belief that what is written is more important than who writes it.
   In the words of Geoffrey Crowther, our editor from 1938 to 1956,
   anonymity keeps the editor “not the master but the servant of something
   far greater than himself…it gives to the paper an astonishing momentum
   of thought and principle.” The notable exception to The Economist’s
   no-byline rule, at least in the weekly issue, is special reports, the
   collections of articles on a single topic that appear in the newspaper
   every month or so. These are almost always written by a single author
   whose name appears once, in the rubric of the opening article. By
   tradition, retiring editors write a valedictory editorial which is also
   signed. But print articles are otherwise anonymous.

   Different rules apply on our website, however. A few years ago we
   decided to start using initials as bylines on our blog posts, to avoid
   confusion on our multi-author blogs (such as Democracy in America,
   which covers American politics). Our journalists can and do disagree
   with each other on our blogs, so we use initials to enable readers to
   distinguish between different writers. This approach is not without its
   faults (we have four staff members with the initials “J.P.”, for
   example) but is the best compromise between total anonymity and full
   bylines, in our view. We also identify our journalists when they appear
   in our audio and video output. And many of them tweet under their own
   names. The internet has caused our no-byline policy to fray a little
   around the edges, then, but the lack of bylines remains central to our
   identity and a distinctive part of our brand.

Audience engagement

   The Economist has been published since September 1843 to take part “in
   a severe contest between intelligence, which presses forward, and an
   unworthy, timid ignorance obstructing our progress”. We have used this
   mission statement to guide our coverage since 1843. Digital
   technologies and the ease of mass online communication enable us to
   engage in this severe contest in ways that our founding editor could
   not have imagined.

   We post our content across online and social channels, and encourage
   our audiences to engage with it, for example by commenting and sharing.
   We have a team of community editors and social-media writers who use
   our content to provoke the severe contest among our online audiences.
   The channels we use include Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, YouTube,
   Medium and LINE. Which channels we use, and how we use them, changes as
   the nature of online media consumption changes.

   We also use various digital opportunities to engage audiences more
   specifically around certain topics, stories or journalists. For
   example, we host online Q&As during which audiences can interact with
   our journalists. We also sometimes involve audiences in the process of
   producing our journalism, such as calling for input on Twitter or
   Medium. And we publish blog posts on our Medium publication about how
   we work, engaging in discussion about the process of journalism itself.

Unnamed sources

     * We make use of unnamed sources and conversations on background
       because they can be more informative.
     * We may withhold the name of a source who talks to us on the record,
       if that individual might be put in danger or legal jeopardy if
       their name is revealed or if we deem it otherwise unnecessary to
       name them.
     * We strive to describe unnamed sources with as much detail as we
       think readers need to assess their credibility.

Fact-checking standards

     * We aim to ensure that any fact, figure or quotation is checked for
       accuracy and credibility by our fact-checkers. (This applies to all
       articles published in the newspaper, Snapchat editions, our
       Espresso app, video scripts and online, but not to all blog posts,
       some of which are self-published by their authors.) We have a
       dedicated Research Department to support this task.
     * Authors are expected to write with fact-checking in mind, and
       should be ready to provide source material and to discuss and
       respond to questions.
     * We work on edited copy as close to the final version as deadlines
       allow.
     * We check against original sources that we believe to be reliable;
       for items that cannot be verified directly we form a view based on
       other credible information.
     * We also consider whether the context and presentation of the facts
       are fair.
     * There is no standard process and the methods adopted will depend on
       the nature of the material and the need for timely reporting of
       (often breaking) news.
     * We discuss queries with the author or editor.
     * All queries must be resolved before a story is published. The final
       say on any matter rests with the relevant editor.

Corrections

   We aim to acknowledge serious factual errors and correct such mistakes
   quickly, clearly and appropriately. Online, published corrections
   should note what was wrong, what was put right and when. In print, we
   will publish a correction in the same section in a future issue of the
   newspaper. Readers who wish to bring errors to our attention may e-mail
   letters@economist.com.
