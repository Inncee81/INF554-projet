Fert perksMore employers want to help workers make babies

   Companies from Apple, Facebook and Tesla to Bain, KKR and Starbucks are
   offering employees fertility benefits

Print edition | Business

   Aug 8th 2019

   WHEN APPLE and Facebook began paying for employees to freeze their eggs
   in 2014, this generosity was met with cynicism. Critics dismissed it as
   another attempt at social engineering from Silicon Valley, no bastion
   of female-friendliness. Rather than empowering women, they feared, it
   would press them to delay motherhood; Apple would do better to install
   child-care facilities at its brand new headquarters.

   Such gripes have not stopped employers from embracing such schemes.
   Quite the opposite. More than one in four large American companies now
   pay for some fertility treatment, according to consultants at Mercer;
   one in 20 covers egg-freezing. In America Bain, a consultancy, KKR, a
   private-equity firm, and Tesla, a carmaker, pay for unlimited IVF
   cycles (which can cost $100,000), according to Fertility IQ, an
   educational site for fertility patients. This week Starbucks said it
   would raise its fertility cover to $25,000, including for baristas who
   work over 20 hours a week for more than six months. For part-timers on
   $12 an hour that can add up to twice their annual salary.

   Most American states still do not require insurers to cover infertility
   treatment. So companies use the benefits to differentiate themselves.
   This helps recruit and retain staff, says Jake Anderson-Bialis of
   Fertility IQ. It found that 62% of workers whose employer had paid in
   full for IVF said they were more likely to stay in their job. Firms
   keen to promote “diversity and inclusion” see health plans with IVF or
   surrogacy as a way to attract LGBT employees.

   Some companies insist that workers try the natural way for a year
   before they qualify for treatment (to the exclusion of anyone who isn’t
   a heterosexual in a stable relationship). Others appear to adopt
   fertility benefits in response to harassment scandals. Under Armour,
   Uber and Vice added family-friendly policies, including generous
   fertility perks, following such controversies.

   A lot of this is welcome. But advocates of gender equality are right to
   point out that some benefits—egg-freezing in particular—look like a
   distraction. And it is no substitute for eliminating the
   motherhood-penalty in the workplace.■

CharlemagneEurocrats know Boris Johnson well, making no-deal Brexit more
likely

   Familiarity breeds contempt

Print edition | Europe

   Aug 15th 2019

   THE LAST time continental Europeans felt they were dealing with an
   easily readable, straightforward British prime minister was in the late
   1990s. Tony Blair charmed his continental colleagues. He wooed the
   French in their own language, led fellow heads of government on a bike
   ride through Amsterdam during a Dutch-led summit and made common cause
   with fellow “third way” social democrats like Gerhard Schröder,
   Germany’s then chancellor. Set against the backdrop of the “Cool
   Britannia” popularity of British music and fashion, this all suggested
   that Britain had finally cast off its conflicted post-imperial garb and
   was embracing a modern, European identity.

   The glow faded when the Iraq war sundered Mr Blair from the French and
   the Germans. Then came Gordon Brown, David Cameron and Theresa May, who
   were all harder to place. All three made nice at European summits but
   flirted with the Eurosceptic tabloids at home. Mrs May took office in
   July 2016 after the country had voted for Brexit. But who was she? She
   ruled out a second referendum—then considered the most likely outcome
   in some continental capitals—but did not seem to be “of” the
   Brexiteers. At times she posed as a Thatcher-style Iron Lady; at others
   as a sensible Christian democrat. Buffeted by events, she was hard to
   define and left little lasting impression.

   Boris Johnson is a different matter. Unlike his predecessors, Britain’s
   new prime minister is a familiar personality on the continent. Many in
   Brussels know him, by reputation or in person, from his time as a
   reporter there in the 1990s, when he spun highly exaggerated stories
   about the EU and helped pioneer the outraged Eurosceptic style in the
   British press. Continentals also know him from the London Olympics in
   2012, when his performances as the capital’s buffoonish,
   zip-wire-riding cheerleader-in-chief caught the attention of the
   foreign press. Most of all they know him as the villain of the Brexit
   campaign; the man with a lie about the cost of EU membership on the
   side of his big red campaign bus who achieved the sort of victory of
   which nationalist populists on the mainland could only dream.

   Mr Johnson is familiar in other ways. Mr Cameron and Mrs May, the
   previous two Tory prime ministers, bumbled respectively into the Brexit
   referendum and through the Brexit negotiations, both treating the
   subject as fundamentally technocratic. By contrast the new prime
   minister deals in stories and emotions, styling Brexit as a test of the
   country’s mettle, an Odyssean quest, a heroic battle against the
   monsters of bureaucratic overreach, federalism and national stagnation.
   Continental commentators and policymakers view him, it is true, in a
   different narrative role—as the dastardly embodiment of the
   post-imperial nostalgia and chauvinism that Mr Blair seemed to have
   vanquished—but both his self-presentation and the counter-tale make it
   possible to orient him. Unlike his predecessors Mr Johnson fits neatly
   into the story his would-be negotiating partners tell themselves about
   Britain.

   Many Eurocrats were raised on British cultural staples such as Harry
   Potter, Midsomer Murders, Downton Abbey, James Bond and Monty Python.
   Mr Johnson would not look out of place in any of these imaginary
   worlds. He is a gift to those continentals who love the familiar
   clichés; who imagine Britain as an old-fashioned, quasi-Victorian
   society of rigid class differences, lip-curling toffs and shabby
   proletarians, absurd social rituals, public-school humour and eccentric
   colonial adventurers. Mr Blair was simple, initially at least, in that
   he seemed to show that Britain had changed. Mr Brown, Mr Cameron and
   Mrs May did not map neatly onto the clichés. But Mr Johnson fits them
   as snugly as a bearskin hat on a guard outside Buckingham Palace.

   All of which bodes poorly for the looming confrontation. Mr Johnson has
   refused to travel to meet continental leaders unless they change the
   terms of the Brexit deal negotiated by Mrs May. He wants to remove the
   “backstop” that would keep Britain close to the EU, and Northern
   Ireland even closer, unless an alternative technological solution can
   be found to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland. The EU’s
   leaders consider the matter closed. So no meeting has taken place. Mr
   Johnson will have his first prime ministerial encounters with Angela
   Merkel and Emmanuel Macron at the G7 summit from August 24th, and again
   at an EU summit in mid-October ahead of October 31st, when Britain is
   currently bound to leave the club. Mr Johnson is increasing
   preparations for a no-deal departure, hoping to force the EU into
   compromises to avoid the cost and chaos of such a disorderly exit.

   He is miscalculating. The EU is better prepared for a no-deal than
   Britain and would suffer much less. National leaders are sick of the
   subject. They consider the current deal generous to Britain—the
   backstop would grant Britain many of the benefits of belonging to the
   EU without some of the usual conditions—and are loth to reopen it to
   make concessions that might further undermine the marginal value of
   membership. Some, especially in Paris and Brussels, believe that
   no-deal may be a price worth paying.

Uncool Britannia

   Mr Johnson’s familiarity significantly boosts this tendency—for three
   reasons. First, to know him is to know that he is unreliable,
   unscrupulous and inconsistent. Second, his story (as leader of a heroic
   quest) and the story his critics tell (as the villain of a tragedy)
   both breed fatalism; they shrink the space for the technological fudge
   of a compromise and make the emotional conflagration of a no-deal more
   likely. And third, Mr Johnson conforms closely enough to the clichés
   about Britain that his negotiating partners can fall back on these as
   explanations for a rupture; this post-imperial, class-ridden,
   unreconstructed country, they will be able to say, is simply different
   and might even benefit from the revealing, purgative chaos of a
   no-deal. Familiarity, at least where Britain’s prime minister is
   concerned, breeds contempt. ■

The Economist explainsWhat is the OECD?

   What does “a club of mostly rich countries” actually do?

The Economist explains

   Jul 6th 2017

   by BUTTONWOOD

   MANY articles in The Economist cite reports or statistics from the
   Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development or OECD. Often
   we add the description, “a club of rich countries” (something it isn’t
   that happy about). What is this club, and what does it actually do?

   The OECD was founded in 1961 but grew out of the Organisation for
   European Economic Cooperation which was set up in 1948 to operate the
   Marshall plan, the American aid programme for war-ravaged Europe. The
   OECD included non-European countries; the idea behind its formation was
   to encourage economic interdependence among member nations with the
   help of evidence-based analysis. Its members fund its work.

   Countries have to apply to join and must meet minimum legal and other
   standards; they benefit from the group’s research and from the prestige
   of being an OECD member. There are now 35 members, with Latvia the
   latest to sign up, in 2016. The OECD has produced standards on bribery,
   consumer protection and the responsible sourcing of minerals, among
   many others. (These are purely voluntary.)

   The club of mostly rich countries is probably best known for three
   things. The first is its regular economic reports, both on the global
   outlook and on individual countries; its policy criticisms can generate
   headlines. The second is its work on tax avoidance or BEPS (Base
   Erosion and Profit Shifting), aimed at allowing countries to
   co-ordinate their policies. The third is its analysis of education
   standards or PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment),
   which causes nations to fret when they drop down the rankings. Perhaps
   a more fitting, if more prosaic, description would be “a research and
   standards body”.

Corporate ambitionsAmazon, the world’s most remarkable firm, is just getting
started

   Amazon has the potential to meet the expectations of investors. But
   success will bring a big problem

Print edition | Leaders

   Mar 25th 2017

   AMAZON is an extraordinary company. The former bookseller accounts for
   more than half of every new dollar spent online in America. It is the
   world’s leading provider of cloud computing. This year Amazon will
   probably spend twice as much on television as HBO, a cable channel. Its
   own-brand physical products include batteries, almonds, suits and
   speakers linked to a virtual voice-activated assistant that can
   control, among other things, your lamps and sprinkler.

   Yet Amazon’s shareholders are working on the premise that it is just
   getting started. Since the beginning of 2015 its share price has jumped
   by 173%, seven times quicker than in the two previous years (and 12
   times faster than the S&P 500 index). With a market capitalisation of
   some $400bn, it is the fifth-most-valuable firm in the world. Never
   before has a company been worth so much for so long while making so
   little money: 92% of its value is due to profits expected after 2020.

   That is because investors anticipate both an extraordinary rise in
   revenue, from sales of $136bn last year to half a trillion over the
   next decade, and a jump in profits. The hopes invested in it imply that
   it will probably become more profitable than any other firm in America.
   Ground for scepticism does not come much more fertile than this: Amazon
   will have to grow faster than almost any big company in modern history
   to justify its valuation. Can it possibly do so?

   It is easy to tick off some of the pitfalls. Rivals will not stand
   still. Microsoft has cloud-computing ambitions; Walmart already has
   revenues nudging $500bn and is beefing up online. If anything happened
   to Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder and boss, the gap would be
   exceptionally hard to fill. But the striking thing about the company is
   how much of a chance it has of achieving such unprecedented goals (see
   article).

A new sort of basket-case

   This is largely due to the firm’s unusual approach to two dimensions of
   corporate life. The first of these is time. In an era when executives
   routinely whinge about pressure to produce short-term results, Amazon
   is resolutely focused on the distant horizon. Mr Bezos emphasises
   continual investment to propel its two principal businesses, e-commerce
   and Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud-computing arm.

   In e-commerce, the more shoppers Amazon lures, the more retailers and
   manufacturers want to sell their goods on Amazon. That gives Amazon
   more cash for new services—such as two-hour shipping and streaming
   video and music—which entice more shoppers. Similarly, the more
   customers use AWS, the more Amazon can invest in new services, which
   attract more customers. A third virtuous circle is starting to whirl
   around Alexa, the firm’s voice-activated assistant: as developers build
   services for Alexa, it becomes more useful to consumers, giving
   developers reason to create yet more services.

   So long as shareholders retain their faith in this model, Amazon’s
   heady valuation resembles a self-fulfilling prophecy. The company will
   be able to keep spending, and its spending will keep making it more
   powerful. Their faith is sustained by Amazon’s record. It has had its
   failures—its attempt to make a smartphone was a debacle. But the
   business is starting to crank out cash. Last year cashflow (before
   investment) was $16bn, more than quadruple the level five years ago.

   If Amazon’s approach to time-frames is unusual, so too is the sheer
   breadth of its activities. The company’s list of current and possible
   competitors, as described in its annual filings, includes logistics
   firms, search engines, social networks, food manufacturers and
   producers of “physical, digital and interactive media of all types”. A
   wingspan this large is more reminiscent of a conglomerate than a
   retailer, which makes Amazon’s share price seem even more bloated:
   stockmarkets typically apply a “conglomerate discount” to reflect their
   inefficiencies.

   Many of these services support Amazon’s own expansion and that of other
   companies. The obvious example is AWS, which powers Amazon’s operations
   as well as those of other firms. But Amazon also rents warehouse space
   to other sellers. It is building a $1.5bn air-freight hub in Kentucky.
   It is testing technology in stores to let consumers skip the cash
   register altogether, and experimenting with drone deliveries to the
   home. Such tools could presumably serve other customers, too. Some
   think that Amazon could become a new kind of utility: one that provides
   the infrastructure of commerce, from computing power to payments to
   logistics.

A giant cannot hide

   And here lies the real problem with the expectations surrounding
   Amazon. If it gets anywhere close to fulfilling them, it will attract
   the attention of regulators. For now, Amazon is unlikely to trigger
   antitrust action. It is not yet the biggest retailer in America, its
   most mature market. America’s antitrust enforcers look mainly at a
   firm’s effect on consumers and pricing. Seen through this lens, Amazon
   appears pristine. Consumers applaud it; it is the most well-regarded
   company in America, according to a Harris poll. (AWS is a boon to
   startups, too.)

   But as it grows, so will concerns about its power. Even on standard
   antitrust grounds, that may pose a problem: if it makes as much money
   as investors hope, a rough calculation suggests its earnings could be
   worth the equivalent of 25% of the combined profits of listed Western
   retail and media firms. But regulators are also changing the way they
   think about technology. In Europe, Google stands accused of using its
   clout as a search engine to extend its power to adjacent businesses.
   The comparative immunity from legal liability of digital platforms—for
   the posting of inflammatory content on Facebook, say, or the vetting of
   drivers on Uber—is being chipped away.

   Amazon’s business model will also encourage regulators to think
   differently. Investors value Amazon’s growth over profits; that makes
   predatory pricing more tempting. In future, firms could increasingly
   depend on tools provided by their biggest rival. If Amazon does become
   a utility for commerce, the calls will grow for it to be regulated as
   one. Shareholders are right to believe in Amazon’s potential. But
   success will bring it into conflict with an even stronger beast:
   government.

   Special report: E-commerce

Home and awayAlibaba and Amazon look to go global

   E-commerce giants are trying to export their success

Print edition | Special report

   Oct 26th 2017

   IN SEPTEMBER 2014 Jeff Bezos announced his first big investment in
   India, hopping aboard a colourful bus in Bangalore. It was the start of
   a rapid $5bn investment in India, part of Mr Bezos’s plans to take
   Amazon global. Two months later Alibaba’s Jack Ma appeared in Delhi.
   “We will invest more in India,” he declared. The following year Alibaba
   put $500m into Paytm, an Indian digital-payments company. This year it
   led a fundraising round for Paytm’s e-commerce arm. The two giants seem
   set for an epic clash in India.

   But in their home markets they have so far stayed out of each other’s
   way. Amazon has only a tiny business in China. Alibaba’s strategy in
   the United States has been to help American businesses sell in China
   and vice versa. “People always ask me, when will you go to the US?”
   says Alibaba’s CEO, Mr Zhang. “And I say, why the US? Amazon did a
   fantastic job.” The two firms have mostly invested in different foreign
   markets: Alibaba across South-East Asia and Amazon across Europe. But
   much of the rest of the world is still up for grabs.

   The biggest tussles will probably be over growing economies and
   cross-border commerce. Alibaba aspires to serve 2bn customers around
   the world within 20 years—a benevolent empire that supports businesses.
   In some cases it has begun with digital payments, as in India with
   Paytm. In others it has invested in e-commerce sites, as with Lazada,
   in South-East Asia. But it intends to build a broad range of services
   within each market, including payments, e-commerce and travel services,
   and then link local platforms with Alibaba’s in China.

   Mr Ma wants to enable small firms to operate just as nimbly as big ones
   on the global stage. Alibaba helps Chinese companies sell in places
   such as Brazil and Russia, and assists foreign firms with marketing,
   logistics and customs in China. Eventually it hopes to use its
   technology to link logistics networks around the world so that any
   product can reach any buyer anywhere within 72 hours. That is still a
   long way off, but it gives a glimpse of the company’s staggering
   ambition.

   Amazon already earns more than one-third of its revenue from e-commerce
   outside North America. Germany is its second-biggest market, followed
   by Japan and Britain. This year it bought Souq, an e-commerce firm in
   the Middle East. Its criteria for expansion elsewhere include the size
   of the population and the economy and the density of internet use, says
   Russ Grandinetti, head of Amazon’s international business. India has
   been one of its main testing grounds.

   Amazon, like Alibaba, also wants to help suppliers in any country to
   sell their products abroad. An Amazon shopper in Mexico, for instance,
   can buy goods from America. Mr Grandinetti sees such cross-border sales
   as an increasingly important component of Amazon’s value to consumers
   and sellers alike.

   Yet both companies run the risk that strategies which did well in their
   home countries may not succeed elsewhere. In China, for instance, the
   popularity of e-commerce relied on a number of special factors. China’s
   manufacturers often found themselves with excess supplies of clothes
   and shoes; Alibaba provided a place to sell them. Alipay thrived
   because few consumers had credit cards. China has also benefited from
   having cheap labour and lots of big cities—more than 100 of them with
   over 1m people—creating a density of demand that made it worthwhile for
   logistics firms to build distribution networks.

   As they expand, however, Amazon’s and Alibaba’s business models may
   shift and, in some markets, start to converge. So far the companies
   have differed in important ways. Amazon owns inventory and warehouses;
   Alibaba does not. But Alibaba has a broader reach than Amazon,
   particularly with Ant Financial’s giant payments business. As Amazon
   grows, it may become more like Alibaba. In India, for instance,
   regulations prevent it from owning inventory directly. And Amazon
   recently won a licence from the Reserve Bank of India for a digital
   wallet. Alibaba, for its part, may become more like Amazon. As the
   Chinese firm set its sights on South-East Asia, it invested in
   SingPost, Singapore’s state postal system. In September it became the
   majority owner in Cainiao, a Chinese logistics network, and said it
   plans to spend $15bn on logistics in the next five years.

   Their advances may be slowed by other rivals. Smaller firms can
   flourish in niches. Flipkart, whose backers include Naspers and
   SoftBank, is competing fiercely with Amazon in India; the two companies
   routinely bicker over which has the bigger market share. Yoox
   Net-a-Porter, an online luxury-goods seller, is also expanding around
   the world.

   Among the questions facing the two giants are whether other technology
   firms will pour more money into e-commerce, and what partnerships might
   emerge. Tencent’s WeChat Pay is already challenging Alipay in China.
   About one-third of WeChat’s users in China shop on that platform.
   Tencent is trying to recruit shops to accept its payment app in other
   countries, too, and recently took a stake in Flipkart. In deploying its
   services abroad, Tencent might get a helping hand from Naspers. The
   South African company owns about one-third of Tencent and has backed
   e-commerce firms around the world. Facebook is now muscling in on this
   business by making it easier for its users to buy goods through its
   messaging service as well as its other platforms, WhatsApp and
   Instagram.

   The A-list still stands
   For now, however, Amazon and Alibaba remain each other’s most
   formidable international rivals. Success in e-commerce requires scale,
   which needs lots of capital. Local e-commerce firms in India have come
   under pressure from investors to boost profitability. Amazon has no
   problems on that score. As Amit Agarwal, head of Amazon India, puts it:
   “We will invest whatever it takes to make sure we provide a great
   customer experience.”

   Big firms also have a natural advantage as they expand, because
   technologies developed for one market can be introduced across many.
   “It’s like a Lego set,” says Lazada’s chief executive, Maximilian
   Bittner. He can use pieces of Alibaba’s model, such as algorithms for
   product recommendations, to improve Lazada’s operations. Amazon’s
   investments in machine learning have myriad applications anywhere in
   the world.

   That does not mean that Amazon and Alibaba will dominate every country
   around the world, nor that they will crush every competitor. Bob Van
   Dijk, chief executive of Naspers, maintains there is room for many
   operators: “I don’t believe in absolute hegemony.” But given the two
   giants’ ambitions and the benefits of scale, they are bound to become
   more powerful and compete directly in more places. That has
   implications for all sorts of industries, but particularly the retail
   sector.

Fert perksMore employers want to help workers make babies

   Companies from Apple, Facebook and Tesla to Bain, KKR and Starbucks are
   offering employees fertility benefits

Print edition | Business

   Aug 8th 2019

   WHEN APPLE and Facebook began paying for employees to freeze their eggs
   in 2014, this generosity was met with cynicism. Critics dismissed it as
   another attempt at social engineering from Silicon Valley, no bastion
   of female-friendliness. Rather than empowering women, they feared, it
   would press them to delay motherhood; Apple would do better to install
   child-care facilities at its brand new headquarters.

   Such gripes have not stopped employers from embracing such schemes.
   Quite the opposite. More than one in four large American companies now
   pay for some fertility treatment, according to consultants at Mercer;
   one in 20 covers egg-freezing. In America Bain, a consultancy, KKR, a
   private-equity firm, and Tesla, a carmaker, pay for unlimited IVF
   cycles (which can cost $100,000), according to Fertility IQ, an
   educational site for fertility patients. This week Starbucks said it
   would raise its fertility cover to $25,000, including for baristas who
   work over 20 hours a week for more than six months. For part-timers on
   $12 an hour that can add up to twice their annual salary.

   Most American states still do not require insurers to cover infertility
   treatment. So companies use the benefits to differentiate themselves.
   This helps recruit and retain staff, says Jake Anderson-Bialis of
   Fertility IQ. It found that 62% of workers whose employer had paid in
   full for IVF said they were more likely to stay in their job. Firms
   keen to promote “diversity and inclusion” see health plans with IVF or
   surrogacy as a way to attract LGBT employees.

   Some companies insist that workers try the natural way for a year
   before they qualify for treatment (to the exclusion of anyone who isn’t
   a heterosexual in a stable relationship). Others appear to adopt
   fertility benefits in response to harassment scandals. Under Armour,
   Uber and Vice added family-friendly policies, including generous
   fertility perks, following such controversies.

   A lot of this is welcome. But advocates of gender equality are right to
   point out that some benefits—egg-freezing in particular—look like a
   distraction. And it is no substitute for eliminating the
   motherhood-penalty in the workplace.■

CharlemagneEurocrats know Boris Johnson well, making no-deal Brexit more
likely

   Familiarity breeds contempt

Print edition | Europe

   Aug 15th 2019

   THE LAST time continental Europeans felt they were dealing with an
   easily readable, straightforward British prime minister was in the late
   1990s. Tony Blair charmed his continental colleagues. He wooed the
   French in their own language, led fellow heads of government on a bike
   ride through Amsterdam during a Dutch-led summit and made common cause
   with fellow “third way” social democrats like Gerhard Schröder,
   Germany’s then chancellor. Set against the backdrop of the “Cool
   Britannia” popularity of British music and fashion, this all suggested
   that Britain had finally cast off its conflicted post-imperial garb and
   was embracing a modern, European identity.

   The glow faded when the Iraq war sundered Mr Blair from the French and
   the Germans. Then came Gordon Brown, David Cameron and Theresa May, who
   were all harder to place. All three made nice at European summits but
   flirted with the Eurosceptic tabloids at home. Mrs May took office in
   July 2016 after the country had voted for Brexit. But who was she? She
   ruled out a second referendum—then considered the most likely outcome
   in some continental capitals—but did not seem to be “of” the
   Brexiteers. At times she posed as a Thatcher-style Iron Lady; at others
   as a sensible Christian democrat. Buffeted by events, she was hard to
   define and left little lasting impression.

   Boris Johnson is a different matter. Unlike his predecessors, Britain’s
   new prime minister is a familiar personality on the continent. Many in
   Brussels know him, by reputation or in person, from his time as a
   reporter there in the 1990s, when he spun highly exaggerated stories
   about the EU and helped pioneer the outraged Eurosceptic style in the
   British press. Continentals also know him from the London Olympics in
   2012, when his performances as the capital’s buffoonish,
   zip-wire-riding cheerleader-in-chief caught the attention of the
   foreign press. Most of all they know him as the villain of the Brexit
   campaign; the man with a lie about the cost of EU membership on the
   side of his big red campaign bus who achieved the sort of victory of
   which nationalist populists on the mainland could only dream.

   Mr Johnson is familiar in other ways. Mr Cameron and Mrs May, the
   previous two Tory prime ministers, bumbled respectively into the Brexit
   referendum and through the Brexit negotiations, both treating the
   subject as fundamentally technocratic. By contrast the new prime
   minister deals in stories and emotions, styling Brexit as a test of the
   country’s mettle, an Odyssean quest, a heroic battle against the
   monsters of bureaucratic overreach, federalism and national stagnation.
   Continental commentators and policymakers view him, it is true, in a
   different narrative role—as the dastardly embodiment of the
   post-imperial nostalgia and chauvinism that Mr Blair seemed to have
   vanquished—but both his self-presentation and the counter-tale make it
   possible to orient him. Unlike his predecessors Mr Johnson fits neatly
   into the story his would-be negotiating partners tell themselves about
   Britain.

   Many Eurocrats were raised on British cultural staples such as Harry
   Potter, Midsomer Murders, Downton Abbey, James Bond and Monty Python.
   Mr Johnson would not look out of place in any of these imaginary
   worlds. He is a gift to those continentals who love the familiar
   clichés; who imagine Britain as an old-fashioned, quasi-Victorian
   society of rigid class differences, lip-curling toffs and shabby
   proletarians, absurd social rituals, public-school humour and eccentric
   colonial adventurers. Mr Blair was simple, initially at least, in that
   he seemed to show that Britain had changed. Mr Brown, Mr Cameron and
   Mrs May did not map neatly onto the clichés. But Mr Johnson fits them
   as snugly as a bearskin hat on a guard outside Buckingham Palace.

   All of which bodes poorly for the looming confrontation. Mr Johnson has
   refused to travel to meet continental leaders unless they change the
   terms of the Brexit deal negotiated by Mrs May. He wants to remove the
   “backstop” that would keep Britain close to the EU, and Northern
   Ireland even closer, unless an alternative technological solution can
   be found to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland. The EU’s
   leaders consider the matter closed. So no meeting has taken place. Mr
   Johnson will have his first prime ministerial encounters with Angela
   Merkel and Emmanuel Macron at the G7 summit from August 24th, and again
   at an EU summit in mid-October ahead of October 31st, when Britain is
   currently bound to leave the club. Mr Johnson is increasing
   preparations for a no-deal departure, hoping to force the EU into
   compromises to avoid the cost and chaos of such a disorderly exit.

   He is miscalculating. The EU is better prepared for a no-deal than
   Britain and would suffer much less. National leaders are sick of the
   subject. They consider the current deal generous to Britain—the
   backstop would grant Britain many of the benefits of belonging to the
   EU without some of the usual conditions—and are loth to reopen it to
   make concessions that might further undermine the marginal value of
   membership. Some, especially in Paris and Brussels, believe that
   no-deal may be a price worth paying.

Uncool Britannia

   Mr Johnson’s familiarity significantly boosts this tendency—for three
   reasons. First, to know him is to know that he is unreliable,
   unscrupulous and inconsistent. Second, his story (as leader of a heroic
   quest) and the story his critics tell (as the villain of a tragedy)
   both breed fatalism; they shrink the space for the technological fudge
   of a compromise and make the emotional conflagration of a no-deal more
   likely. And third, Mr Johnson conforms closely enough to the clichés
   about Britain that his negotiating partners can fall back on these as
   explanations for a rupture; this post-imperial, class-ridden,
   unreconstructed country, they will be able to say, is simply different
   and might even benefit from the revealing, purgative chaos of a
   no-deal. Familiarity, at least where Britain’s prime minister is
   concerned, breeds contempt. ■

The Economist explainsWhat is the OECD?

   What does “a club of mostly rich countries” actually do?

The Economist explains

   Jul 6th 2017

   by BUTTONWOOD

   MANY articles in The Economist cite reports or statistics from the
   Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development or OECD. Often
   we add the description, “a club of rich countries” (something it isn’t
   that happy about). What is this club, and what does it actually do?

   The OECD was founded in 1961 but grew out of the Organisation for
   European Economic Cooperation which was set up in 1948 to operate the
   Marshall plan, the American aid programme for war-ravaged Europe. The
   OECD included non-European countries; the idea behind its formation was
   to encourage economic interdependence among member nations with the
   help of evidence-based analysis. Its members fund its work.

   Countries have to apply to join and must meet minimum legal and other
   standards; they benefit from the group’s research and from the prestige
   of being an OECD member. There are now 35 members, with Latvia the
   latest to sign up, in 2016. The OECD has produced standards on bribery,
   consumer protection and the responsible sourcing of minerals, among
   many others. (These are purely voluntary.)

   The club of mostly rich countries is probably best known for three
   things. The first is its regular economic reports, both on the global
   outlook and on individual countries; its policy criticisms can generate
   headlines. The second is its work on tax avoidance or BEPS (Base
   Erosion and Profit Shifting), aimed at allowing countries to
   co-ordinate their policies. The third is its analysis of education
   standards or PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment),
   which causes nations to fret when they drop down the rankings. Perhaps
   a more fitting, if more prosaic, description would be “a research and
   standards body”.

Corporate ambitionsAmazon, the world’s most remarkable firm, is just getting
started

   Amazon has the potential to meet the expectations of investors. But
   success will bring a big problem

Print edition | Leaders

   Mar 25th 2017

   AMAZON is an extraordinary company. The former bookseller accounts for
   more than half of every new dollar spent online in America. It is the
   world’s leading provider of cloud computing. This year Amazon will
   probably spend twice as much on television as HBO, a cable channel. Its
   own-brand physical products include batteries, almonds, suits and
   speakers linked to a virtual voice-activated assistant that can
   control, among other things, your lamps and sprinkler.

   Yet Amazon’s shareholders are working on the premise that it is just
   getting started. Since the beginning of 2015 its share price has jumped
   by 173%, seven times quicker than in the two previous years (and 12
   times faster than the S&P 500 index). With a market capitalisation of
   some $400bn, it is the fifth-most-valuable firm in the world. Never
   before has a company been worth so much for so long while making so
   little money: 92% of its value is due to profits expected after 2020.

   That is because investors anticipate both an extraordinary rise in
   revenue, from sales of $136bn last year to half a trillion over the
   next decade, and a jump in profits. The hopes invested in it imply that
   it will probably become more profitable than any other firm in America.
   Ground for scepticism does not come much more fertile than this: Amazon
   will have to grow faster than almost any big company in modern history
   to justify its valuation. Can it possibly do so?

   It is easy to tick off some of the pitfalls. Rivals will not stand
   still. Microsoft has cloud-computing ambitions; Walmart already has
   revenues nudging $500bn and is beefing up online. If anything happened
   to Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder and boss, the gap would be
   exceptionally hard to fill. But the striking thing about the company is
   how much of a chance it has of achieving such unprecedented goals (see
   article).

A new sort of basket-case

   This is largely due to the firm’s unusual approach to two dimensions of
   corporate life. The first of these is time. In an era when executives
   routinely whinge about pressure to produce short-term results, Amazon
   is resolutely focused on the distant horizon. Mr Bezos emphasises
   continual investment to propel its two principal businesses, e-commerce
   and Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud-computing arm.

   In e-commerce, the more shoppers Amazon lures, the more retailers and
   manufacturers want to sell their goods on Amazon. That gives Amazon
   more cash for new services—such as two-hour shipping and streaming
   video and music—which entice more shoppers. Similarly, the more
   customers use AWS, the more Amazon can invest in new services, which
   attract more customers. A third virtuous circle is starting to whirl
   around Alexa, the firm’s voice-activated assistant: as developers build
   services for Alexa, it becomes more useful to consumers, giving
   developers reason to create yet more services.

   So long as shareholders retain their faith in this model, Amazon’s
   heady valuation resembles a self-fulfilling prophecy. The company will
   be able to keep spending, and its spending will keep making it more
   powerful. Their faith is sustained by Amazon’s record. It has had its
   failures—its attempt to make a smartphone was a debacle. But the
   business is starting to crank out cash. Last year cashflow (before
   investment) was $16bn, more than quadruple the level five years ago.

   If Amazon’s approach to time-frames is unusual, so too is the sheer
   breadth of its activities. The company’s list of current and possible
   competitors, as described in its annual filings, includes logistics
   firms, search engines, social networks, food manufacturers and
   producers of “physical, digital and interactive media of all types”. A
   wingspan this large is more reminiscent of a conglomerate than a
   retailer, which makes Amazon’s share price seem even more bloated:
   stockmarkets typically apply a “conglomerate discount” to reflect their
   inefficiencies.

   Many of these services support Amazon’s own expansion and that of other
   companies. The obvious example is AWS, which powers Amazon’s operations
   as well as those of other firms. But Amazon also rents warehouse space
   to other sellers. It is building a $1.5bn air-freight hub in Kentucky.
   It is testing technology in stores to let consumers skip the cash
   register altogether, and experimenting with drone deliveries to the
   home. Such tools could presumably serve other customers, too. Some
   think that Amazon could become a new kind of utility: one that provides
   the infrastructure of commerce, from computing power to payments to
   logistics.

A giant cannot hide

   And here lies the real problem with the expectations surrounding
   Amazon. If it gets anywhere close to fulfilling them, it will attract
   the attention of regulators. For now, Amazon is unlikely to trigger
   antitrust action. It is not yet the biggest retailer in America, its
   most mature market. America’s antitrust enforcers look mainly at a
   firm’s effect on consumers and pricing. Seen through this lens, Amazon
   appears pristine. Consumers applaud it; it is the most well-regarded
   company in America, according to a Harris poll. (AWS is a boon to
   startups, too.)

   But as it grows, so will concerns about its power. Even on standard
   antitrust grounds, that may pose a problem: if it makes as much money
   as investors hope, a rough calculation suggests its earnings could be
   worth the equivalent of 25% of the combined profits of listed Western
   retail and media firms. But regulators are also changing the way they
   think about technology. In Europe, Google stands accused of using its
   clout as a search engine to extend its power to adjacent businesses.
   The comparative immunity from legal liability of digital platforms—for
   the posting of inflammatory content on Facebook, say, or the vetting of
   drivers on Uber—is being chipped away.

   Amazon’s business model will also encourage regulators to think
   differently. Investors value Amazon’s growth over profits; that makes
   predatory pricing more tempting. In future, firms could increasingly
   depend on tools provided by their biggest rival. If Amazon does become
   a utility for commerce, the calls will grow for it to be regulated as
   one. Shareholders are right to believe in Amazon’s potential. But
   success will bring it into conflict with an even stronger beast:
   government.

   Special report: E-commerce

Home and awayAlibaba and Amazon look to go global

   E-commerce giants are trying to export their success

Print edition | Special report

   Oct 26th 2017

   IN SEPTEMBER 2014 Jeff Bezos announced his first big investment in
   India, hopping aboard a colourful bus in Bangalore. It was the start of
   a rapid $5bn investment in India, part of Mr Bezos’s plans to take
   Amazon global. Two months later Alibaba’s Jack Ma appeared in Delhi.
   “We will invest more in India,” he declared. The following year Alibaba
   put $500m into Paytm, an Indian digital-payments company. This year it
   led a fundraising round for Paytm’s e-commerce arm. The two giants seem
   set for an epic clash in India.

   But in their home markets they have so far stayed out of each other’s
   way. Amazon has only a tiny business in China. Alibaba’s strategy in
   the United States has been to help American businesses sell in China
   and vice versa. “People always ask me, when will you go to the US?”
   says Alibaba’s CEO, Mr Zhang. “And I say, why the US? Amazon did a
   fantastic job.” The two firms have mostly invested in different foreign
   markets: Alibaba across South-East Asia and Amazon across Europe. But
   much of the rest of the world is still up for grabs.

   The biggest tussles will probably be over growing economies and
   cross-border commerce. Alibaba aspires to serve 2bn customers around
   the world within 20 years—a benevolent empire that supports businesses.
   In some cases it has begun with digital payments, as in India with
   Paytm. In others it has invested in e-commerce sites, as with Lazada,
   in South-East Asia. But it intends to build a broad range of services
   within each market, including payments, e-commerce and travel services,
   and then link local platforms with Alibaba’s in China.

   Mr Ma wants to enable small firms to operate just as nimbly as big ones
   on the global stage. Alibaba helps Chinese companies sell in places
   such as Brazil and Russia, and assists foreign firms with marketing,
   logistics and customs in China. Eventually it hopes to use its
   technology to link logistics networks around the world so that any
   product can reach any buyer anywhere within 72 hours. That is still a
   long way off, but it gives a glimpse of the company’s staggering
   ambition.

   Amazon already earns more than one-third of its revenue from e-commerce
   outside North America. Germany is its second-biggest market, followed
   by Japan and Britain. This year it bought Souq, an e-commerce firm in
   the Middle East. Its criteria for expansion elsewhere include the size
   of the population and the economy and the density of internet use, says
   Russ Grandinetti, head of Amazon’s international business. India has
   been one of its main testing grounds.

   Amazon, like Alibaba, also wants to help suppliers in any country to
   sell their products abroad. An Amazon shopper in Mexico, for instance,
   can buy goods from America. Mr Grandinetti sees such cross-border sales
   as an increasingly important component of Amazon’s value to consumers
   and sellers alike.

   Yet both companies run the risk that strategies which did well in their
   home countries may not succeed elsewhere. In China, for instance, the
   popularity of e-commerce relied on a number of special factors. China’s
   manufacturers often found themselves with excess supplies of clothes
   and shoes; Alibaba provided a place to sell them. Alipay thrived
   because few consumers had credit cards. China has also benefited from
   having cheap labour and lots of big cities—more than 100 of them with
   over 1m people—creating a density of demand that made it worthwhile for
   logistics firms to build distribution networks.

   As they expand, however, Amazon’s and Alibaba’s business models may
   shift and, in some markets, start to converge. So far the companies
   have differed in important ways. Amazon owns inventory and warehouses;
   Alibaba does not. But Alibaba has a broader reach than Amazon,
   particularly with Ant Financial’s giant payments business. As Amazon
   grows, it may become more like Alibaba. In India, for instance,
   regulations prevent it from owning inventory directly. And Amazon
   recently won a licence from the Reserve Bank of India for a digital
   wallet. Alibaba, for its part, may become more like Amazon. As the
   Chinese firm set its sights on South-East Asia, it invested in
   SingPost, Singapore’s state postal system. In September it became the
   majority owner in Cainiao, a Chinese logistics network, and said it
   plans to spend $15bn on logistics in the next five years.

   Their advances may be slowed by other rivals. Smaller firms can
   flourish in niches. Flipkart, whose backers include Naspers and
   SoftBank, is competing fiercely with Amazon in India; the two companies
   routinely bicker over which has the bigger market share. Yoox
   Net-a-Porter, an online luxury-goods seller, is also expanding around
   the world.

   Among the questions facing the two giants are whether other technology
   firms will pour more money into e-commerce, and what partnerships might
   emerge. Tencent’s WeChat Pay is already challenging Alipay in China.
   About one-third of WeChat’s users in China shop on that platform.
   Tencent is trying to recruit shops to accept its payment app in other
   countries, too, and recently took a stake in Flipkart. In deploying its
   services abroad, Tencent might get a helping hand from Naspers. The
   South African company owns about one-third of Tencent and has backed
   e-commerce firms around the world. Facebook is now muscling in on this
   business by making it easier for its users to buy goods through its
   messaging service as well as its other platforms, WhatsApp and
   Instagram.

   The A-list still stands
   For now, however, Amazon and Alibaba remain each other’s most
   formidable international rivals. Success in e-commerce requires scale,
   which needs lots of capital. Local e-commerce firms in India have come
   under pressure from investors to boost profitability. Amazon has no
   problems on that score. As Amit Agarwal, head of Amazon India, puts it:
   “We will invest whatever it takes to make sure we provide a great
   customer experience.”

   Big firms also have a natural advantage as they expand, because
   technologies developed for one market can be introduced across many.
   “It’s like a Lego set,” says Lazada’s chief executive, Maximilian
   Bittner. He can use pieces of Alibaba’s model, such as algorithms for
   product recommendations, to improve Lazada’s operations. Amazon’s
   investments in machine learning have myriad applications anywhere in
   the world.

   That does not mean that Amazon and Alibaba will dominate every country
   around the world, nor that they will crush every competitor. Bob Van
   Dijk, chief executive of Naspers, maintains there is room for many
   operators: “I don’t believe in absolute hegemony.” But given the two
   giants’ ambitions and the benefits of scale, they are bound to become
   more powerful and compete directly in more places. That has
   implications for all sorts of industries, but particularly the retail
   sector.
