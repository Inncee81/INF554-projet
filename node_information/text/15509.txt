   Disrupt, Act, Risk to be an Entrepreneur… DARE. This acronym resonates
   perfectly with the values of the LVMH Group: creativity and innovation,
   entrepreneurial sprit and excellence figure at the heart of this
   groundbreaking talent development program for Group employees, inspired
   by open innovation.

   Following a call for ideas sent to managers and high-potential talents
   from across the Group, 60 “idea sponsors” from 40 Maisons and 15
   countries are selected to take part in each DARE session. For three
   days, participants try out new approaches to working and collaborating
   inspired by a startup spirit and then test their entrepreneurial
   mettle.

   After a pitch session, ideas from 12 participants are selected by the
   entire group of attendees. These ideas are then taken forward by teams,
   leading up to a Grand Finale with presentations to a jury of LVMH top
   executives, joined by  entrepreneurs from outside LVMH, which names
   three winners.


   Twenty students and interns from our partner schools are also selected
   to be part of the DARE experience and join one of the 12 teams.


   Participants are supported by mentors – CEOs from LVMH Maisons and
   outside entrepreneurs – who attend all the sessions to help them refine
   their business model, test their prototype and prepare their final
   pitch. This is a unique opportunity for participants to see how their
   ideas stand up in the eyes of experienced experts.

   The three winning teams receive support from an LVMH sponsor to develop
   their project. They may also join the LVMH Maison des Startups at the
   Station F incubator.

   The DARE initiative addresses all the priorities of the LVMH Group
   around the world, from gender equity to sustainable development.
   Sessions are organized in Europe, the United States and Asia.

   LVMH created the LVMH Innovation Award in 2017 to recognize promising
   startups from France and other countries.

   The award reaffirms the importance of initiative and new ideas,
   resonating with the Group’s core values of excellence, creativity,
   innovation and entrepreneurial spirit.

   The LVMH Innovation Award is open to any startup created within the
   past five years with a valuation of under $100 million, fewer than 50
   employees, and whose solutions are relevant to the challenges addressed
   by the LVMH Group and its Maisons.

   Each year 30 startups are chosen as finalists and invited to be part of
   the LVMH Lab during the Viva Technology Show in Paris, which brings
   together the game changers who are driving the digital transformation
   around the world. Co-organized by Publicis Group and media group Les
   Echos, this major event – of which LVMH is a partner – enables
   businesses that are leaders in their industry to build strong
   relationships with startups and help them grow.

   The finalists present pitches to a jury of recognized digital experts,
   which then selects the winner. The winning startup receives support and
   advice from LVMH Group investment specialists and develops a
   partnership with LVMH and its Maisons. Both the winner and the finalist
   startups selected for the LVMH Innovation Award also have an
   opportunity to join the LVMH program at the STATION F incubator.

   The startups that have won the LVMH Innovation Award since its creation
   are Heuritech (deep learning), Oyst (e-commerce solution), VeChain
   (blockchain) and Kronos Care (post-purchase solution).

   LVMH has created an accelerator program at the STATION F startup campus
   that welcomes 50 international startups each year.

   This initiative will drive co-creation by LVMH Maisons and startups to
   bring new services and innovative products to market. By launching La
   Maison des Startups in the heart of the world’s biggest startup campus,
   LVMH reaffirms its values of innovation, entrepreneurial spirit and
   excellence, the pillars that anchor the Group’s growth.

   La Maison des Startups will accelerate collaboration between LVMH
   Maisons and startups whose solutions have potential in the luxury
   industry, giving entrepreneurs privileged access to the unique
   ecosystem formed by the Group’s 70 Maisons. The program’s distinctive
   multi-sector approach enables engagement with entrepreneurs whose
   innovations are relevant to the different LVMH business groups: Wines &
   Spirits, Fashion & Leather Goods, Perfumes & Cosmetics, Watches &
   Jewelry and Selective Retailing.

   With 89 workstations, the LVMH program at STATION F will welcome 50
   international startups each year during two six-month terms. The first
   group joined the campus in November 2017.

   Over half the startups that have joined the program were selected after
   competing for the LVMH Innovation Award at the Viva Technology show.
   LVMH managers whose projects won awards at the different editions of
   DARE LVMH, an initiative that encourages intrapreneurship in the luxury
   industry, are also invited to STATION F to launch their projects.

   In addition to a unique workspace and environment that inspire
   innovation, the LVMH program at STATION F lets entrepreneurs benefit
   from personalized coaching and support from LVMH experts. A series of
   workshops allows the startups to familiarize themselves with challenges
   facing the luxury industry, and pitch sessions are regularly organized
   to let them present the development of their solutions to
   representatives of LVMH Maisons.

   The LVMH Group launched the website WeCareForModels.com in 2018 to
   support the Charter on working relations with fashion models and their
   well-being, drawn up in September 2017 in conjunction with Kering.

   The site reiterates the commitments made by the two groups and proposes
   expert advice for fashion models from nutritionists and coaches,
   encouraging them to play an active role in shaping their profession.

   WeCareForModels.com drives momentum initiated by the Charter to promote
   responsibility, transparency and empowerment, reflecting the two
   groups’ active commitment to eliminating certain behaviors and
   practices that are not compatible with their values, while raising
   awareness among models that they have an active role to play in
   promoting these changes.

   This initiative has strong support from the CEOs and creative directors
   of houses at the two groups, as well as other industry stakeholders
   such as Elle magazine. It is designed primarily for fashion models, but
   also for all those who play a role in their working conditions and
   well-being, spanning both the world of fashion and the public.

   LVMH continually reaffirms a commitment to a diverse workforce,
   reflecting the reality of its businesses and creating an invaluable
   source of performance. This commitment to diversity inspired the
   creation of the EllesVMH en 2007.

   The EllesVMH encourages the professional development of women in all
   positions and at every level of the organization through a variety of
   initiatives.

   “Diversity is a tremendous source of complementary skills and wealth,
   making it a key success factor for LVMH and its Maisons,” says Chantal
   Gaemperle, Group Executive Vice President Human Resources & Synergies.
   “We have an amazing pool of talent at LVMH. Providing inspiring career
   growth opportunities for these ambitious women and men is essential to
   let us meet the challenges we face today and in the future.”

   In addition to the active engagement of our executives and an HR policy
   that encourages true gender diversity – spanning recruitment, training,
   pay equity, career appraisal interviews, maternity or paternity leave –
   three tangible levers have been established:
     * Actions at the Group level including training, coaching, mentoring
       and support for gender diversity programs..
     * A regional network encourages LVMH staff to take part in local
       events and initiatives tailored to the specificities of each
       market.
     * Each Maison also deploys actions aligned with its culture, values
       and strategic priorities.

   In 2013 the LVMH Group and 32 of its Maisons signed the United Nations
   Women’s Empowerment Principles (WEP). In fall 2014 the heads of LVMH
   Maisons based in the United States also signed the charter, bringing
   the total number of LVMH signatories to 41.

   Between 2007 and 2018 the percentage of women in key positions at LVMH
   rose from 23% to 42%. This puts LVMH on track to achieve its new goal
   of 50% women in top management positions by 2020.

   In 2019, LVMH Group companies with over 1,000 employees in France have
   calculated their Gender Equality Index. The consolidated score at the
   LVMH Group level is 90 points (out of 100).
