   This article provides a brief overview of gender pay gap (GPG)
   statistics, including the unadjusted gender pay gap used to monitor
   imbalances in earnings between men and women. The unadjusted gender pay
   gap is defined as the difference between the average gross hourly
   earnings of men and women expressed as a percentage of the average
   gross hourly earnings of men. It is calculated for enterprises with 10
   or more employees.

Gender pay gap levels vary significantly across EU

   For the economy as a whole^[1], in 2017, women's gross hourly earnings
   were on average 16.0 % below those of men in the European Union (EU-28)
   and 16.1% in the euro area (EA-19). Across Member States, the gender
   pay gap varied by 22 percentage points, ranging from 3.5 % in Romania
   to 25.6 % in Estonia (Figure 1).
   Figure 1: The unadjusted gender pay gap, 2017 (difference between
   average gross hourly earnings of male and female employees as % of male
   gross earnings)
   Source: Eurostat (sdg_05_20)

Part-time versus full-time employment

   Pay gaps can also be analysed from the perspective of part-time or
   full-time employment. Information at this level of detail is not
   available, however, for all EU Member States (Figure 2). In 2017, the
   gender pay gap for part-time workers varied from -0.5 % in Germany to
   25.3 % in Croatia. A negative gender pay gap means that on average
   women's gross hourly earnings are higher than those of men. For
   full-time workers, pay gaps varied also widely in the EU Member States,
   ranging from 0.9 % in Belgium to 19.3 % in Latvia.
   Figure 2: The unadjusted gender pay gap by working time (%), 2017.png
   Source: Eurostat (earn_gr_gpgr2wt); see Country codes

Gender pay gap much lower for young employees

   The gender pay gap is generally much lower for new labour market
   entrants and tends to widen with age. However, those differences over
   age groups can have different patterns across the countries (Table 1).
   The gender pay gap might increase with age as a result of the career
   interruptions women experience during their working life, particularly
   older women unable to benefit from specific equality measures which did
   not yet exist when they started to work.
   Table 1: The unadjusted gender pay gap by age (%), 2017
   Source: Eurostat (earn_gr_gpgr2ag)

Highest gender pay gap in financial and insurance activities

   The gender pay gap in financial and insurance activities is higher than
   in the business economy as a whole

   A breakdown for the different sectors of the economy also reveals
   interesting patterns (Table 2). In all EU Member States, except Spain,
   the gender pay gap in the financial and insurance activities (NACE Rev.
   2 section K) is higher than in the business economy as a whole (NACE
   Rev. 2 aggregate B to N). In 2017, the gender pay gap in financial and
   insurance activities varied from 18.3 % in Italy to 40.2 % in Estonia.
   Within the business economy as a whole, the highest gender pay gap was
   recorded in Estonia (26.2 %) and the lowest in Romania (7.3 %).
   Table 2: The unadjusted gender pay gap by economic activity (%), 2017
   Source: Eurostat (earn_gr_gpgr2)

   It is also interesting to note the economic sectors for which a
   significant number of Member States recorded negative gender gaps.
   Eleven Member States registered negative gender pay gaps in the water
   supply, sewerage, waste management and remediation activities (NACE
   Rev. 2 section E) and thirteen in the construction industry (NACE Rev.
   2 section F).

Gender pay gap higher in the private sector

   In 2017, the majority of the EU countries (for which data are
   available) recorded a higher gender pay gap (in absolute terms) in the
   private sector than in the public sector. This might be due to the fact
   that within the public sector, in most countries, employees are
   protected by collective pay agreements and other similar contracts
   establishing pay. The gender pay gap varied in the private sector from
   7.0 % in Romania to 23.0 % in Germany, and in the public sector from
   -6.6 % in Cyprus to 23.9 % in the United Kingdom
   Table 3: The unadjusted gender pay gap by economic control (%), 2017
   Source: Eurostat (earn_gr_gpgr2ct)

Possible causes of the unadjusted gender pay gap

   As an unadjusted indicator, the GPG gives an overall picture of the
   differences between men and women in terms of earnings and measures a
   concept which is broader than the concept of "equal pay for work of
   equal value". A part of the difference in earnings of men and women can
   be explained by differences in the average characteristics of male and
   female employees. In its methodological study, Eurostat carried out the
   decomposition of the unadjusted gender pay gap based on the 2014 data
   of the Structure of Earnings Survey.

Data sources

   From reference year 2006 onwards, the unadjusted gender pay gap is
   based on the methodology of the Structure of earnings survey (SES)
   according to Regulation (EC) No 530/1999. The SES is carried out with a
   four-yearly periodicity. The most recent reference years available for
   the SES are 2010 and 2014. Eurostat computed the gender pay gap for
   these years on this basis. For the intermediate years (2011-2013)
   countries provide to Eurostat gender pay gap estimates benchmarked on
   the SES results.

Context

   Reducing the gender pay gap is one of the key priorities of gender
   policies at both EU and national levels. At EU level, the European
   Commission prioritised "reducing the gender pay, earnings and pension
   gaps and thus fighting poverty among women" as one of the key areas in
   the framework of the Strategic engagement for gender equality
   2016-2019. The unadjusted gender pay gap indicator is used to monitor
   imbalances in earnings between men and women.

   This article provides a brief overview of gender pay gap (GPG)
   statistics, including the unadjusted gender pay gap used to monitor
   imbalances in earnings between men and women. The unadjusted gender pay
   gap is defined as the difference between the average gross hourly
   earnings of men and women expressed as a percentage of the average
   gross hourly earnings of men. It is calculated for enterprises with 10
   or more employees.

Gender pay gap levels vary significantly across EU

   For the economy as a whole^[1], in 2017, women's gross hourly earnings
   were on average 16.0 % below those of men in the European Union (EU-28)
   and 16.1% in the euro area (EA-19). Across Member States, the gender
   pay gap varied by 22 percentage points, ranging from 3.5 % in Romania
   to 25.6 % in Estonia (Figure 1).
   Figure 1: The unadjusted gender pay gap, 2017 (difference between
   average gross hourly earnings of male and female employees as % of male
   gross earnings)
   Source: Eurostat (sdg_05_20)

Part-time versus full-time employment

   Pay gaps can also be analysed from the perspective of part-time or
   full-time employment. Information at this level of detail is not
   available, however, for all EU Member States (Figure 2). In 2017, the
   gender pay gap for part-time workers varied from -0.5 % in Germany to
   25.3 % in Croatia. A negative gender pay gap means that on average
   women's gross hourly earnings are higher than those of men. For
   full-time workers, pay gaps varied also widely in the EU Member States,
   ranging from 0.9 % in Belgium to 19.3 % in Latvia.
   Figure 2: The unadjusted gender pay gap by working time (%), 2017.png

Gender pay gap much lower for young employees

   The gender pay gap is generally much lower for new labour market
   entrants and tends to widen with age. However, those differences over
   age groups can have different patterns across the countries (Table 1).
   The gender pay gap might increase with age as a result of the career
   interruptions women experience during their working life, particularly
   older women unable to benefit from specific equality measures which did
   not yet exist when they started to work.
   Table 1: The unadjusted gender pay gap by age (%), 2017
   Source: Eurostat (earn_gr_gpgr2ag)

Highest gender pay gap in financial and insurance activities

   The gender pay gap in financial and insurance activities is higher than
   in the business economy as a whole

   A breakdown for the different sectors of the economy also reveals
   interesting patterns (Table 2). In all EU Member States, except Spain,
   the gender pay gap in the financial and insurance activities (NACE Rev.
   2 section K) is higher than in the business economy as a whole (NACE
   Rev. 2 aggregate B to N). In 2017, the gender pay gap in financial and
   insurance activities varied from 18.3 % in Italy to 40.2 % in Estonia.
   Within the business economy as a whole, the highest gender pay gap was
   recorded in Estonia (26.2 %) and the lowest in Romania (7.3 %).
   Table 2: The unadjusted gender pay gap by economic activity (%), 2017
   Source: Eurostat (earn_gr_gpgr2)

   It is also interesting to note the economic sectors for which a
   significant number of Member States recorded negative gender gaps.
   Eleven Member States registered negative gender pay gaps in the water
   supply, sewerage, waste management and remediation activities (NACE
   Rev. 2 section E) and thirteen in the construction industry (NACE Rev.
   2 section F).

Gender pay gap higher in the private sector

   In 2017, the majority of the EU countries (for which data are
   available) recorded a higher gender pay gap (in absolute terms) in the
   private sector than in the public sector. This might be due to the fact
   that within the public sector, in most countries, employees are
   protected by collective pay agreements and other similar contracts
   establishing pay. The gender pay gap varied in the private sector from
   7.0 % in Romania to 23.0 % in Germany, and in the public sector from
   -6.6 % in Cyprus to 23.9 % in the United Kingdom
   Table 3: The unadjusted gender pay gap by economic control (%), 2017
   Source: Eurostat (earn_gr_gpgr2ct)

Possible causes of the unadjusted gender pay gap

   As an unadjusted indicator, the GPG gives an overall picture of the
   differences between men and women in terms of earnings and measures a
   concept which is broader than the concept of "equal pay for work of
   equal value". A part of the difference in earnings of men and women can
   be explained by differences in the average characteristics of male and
   female employees. In its methodological study, Eurostat carried out the
   decomposition of the unadjusted gender pay gap based on the 2014 data
   of the Structure of Earnings Survey.

Data sources

   From reference year 2006 onwards, the unadjusted gender pay gap is
   based on the methodology of the Structure of earnings survey (SES)
   according to Regulation (EC) No 530/1999. The SES is carried out with a
   four-yearly periodicity. The most recent reference years available for
   the SES are 2010 and 2014. Eurostat computed the gender pay gap for
   these years on this basis. For the intermediate years (2011-2013)
   countries provide to Eurostat gender pay gap estimates benchmarked on
   the SES results.

Context

   Reducing the gender pay gap is one of the key priorities of gender
   policies at both EU and national levels. At EU level, the European
   Commission prioritised "reducing the gender pay, earnings and pension
   gaps and thus fighting poverty among women" as one of the key areas in
   the framework of the Strategic engagement for gender equality
   2016-2019. The unadjusted gender pay gap indicator is used to monitor
   imbalances in earnings between men and women.
