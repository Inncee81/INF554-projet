Four Weeks from Today!

   by The Pioneer Woman on September 24, 2019

   I received the very first copy of my new cookbook a week or so ago. It
   was so hot off the press, I burned my hand! Just kidding, I didn’t burn
   my hand. Only my index finger! Okay, it wasn’t really hot and I didn’t
   burn anything. But I was burning with excitement! Does that […]

Creamy Roasted Red Pepper Soup

   by The Pioneer Woman on March 19, 2019

   Roasted red peppers are my favorite pantry item; well, they’re up there
   alongside jars of good marinara sauce. You can turn a jar or two of
   roasted red peppers into so many different recipes, from soups to
   sauces to panini to dips. The flavor is mild and slightly sweet, and
   I’m always amazed at how […]

How I Shoot Silhouettes

A Backlit Photo in Full Sun

   Perhaps there are many ways to do this; I just know one. So I will
   share with you my best kept secret. You won’t tell anyone, right? And
   please, don’t hate me for using my Katie again. She’s all I’ve got. But
   I’m getting ready to give you a great tip—one that you can really
   use—so we’ll be even, okay?

   Here’s what I know.

   To take a picture in full sun, you must:

   First, put your camera on Spot Metering. This way your camera will read
   the light from your subject’s face. (To learn how to put your camera on
   Spot Metering, break out you camera’s manual!)

   Now, position your subject so that there is no sun hitting his/her
   face. You do not want white blotches. So walk around a bit, and have
   your model turn her head until you find the right spot.

   But also, while you are doing this, you need to make sure that your
   subject has light behind him/her, and that YOU have light behind you.
   (In other words, make sure you’re not standing under a tree or with
   your back against a building or anything that would block light.)

   The other night when I first went outside to take a few shots, I forgot
   this part of the rule. I was standing under a tree, so there was no
   light bouncing back onto Katie’s face.

   So you see, she does not have enough light on her face despite the fact
   that I did all the other things correctly. This picture is too dark for
   me to want to edit it.

   20080711_4401-ree
   Exposure: 0.01 sec (1/100)
   Aperture: f/4
   Focal Length: 20 mm
   ISO Speed: 100

   So we repositioned ourselves on the other side of the tree, where I had
   lots of light behind me. So did Katie.

   20080711_4433
   Exposure: 0.01 sec (1/100)
   Aperture: f/4
   Focal Length: 55 mm
   ISO Speed: 100

   Look at that. The exposure and the aperture are exactly the same. But
   this one is lighter. The only difference is that I have the light at my
   back on this one.

   Cool huh? This picture looks nice with a little editing because of the
   light.

   In this next one, you can see my shutter is 1/50. Just a little more
   light entered the camera. And this one is more to my liking.

   20080711_4410-soocree
   Exposure: 0.02 sec (1/50)
   Aperture: f/4
   Focal Length: 28 mm
   ISO Speed: 100

   20080711_4410-awm-ree
   For the final picture I sharpened, lightened, ran soft light, and
   cropped.

   I cropped it so that Katie wasn’t smack dab in the middle of the
   picture. I set her eyes along an imaginary line as I tried to follow
   the ‘rule of thirds.’

   But you’ll have to wait until next time, when we can discuss that
   artistic rule.

   Now, go out in that wonderful summer sun and give this a try! Unless
   you’re in Australia. Then you’ll have to settle for winter sun.

   Encourage one another,
   Miz Booshay

       Thank you Donna. I have always had trouble with full sun shots. I
       usually don’t get up early enough for the best light at dawn. And
       Katie is a fine subject.

        I love her eyes and freckles! Great pictures, as always!

       Thanks for the helpful hints. Darling girl! Love the freckles.

       Thank you! I’ve been seeing many beautiful pictures with backlight
       and I didn’t know how to do it! I keep many of your tips in mind
       and thank you for it!!!

        What a beautiful girl! Great shots

        So that’s where I went wrong! I tried this with my daughter the
       other night, and all I got was a mess. I was sitting under a
       tree…no wonder! I’ll work on it again. Thanks for the secret tip!

        I like the up and down photo best.. third from the bottom. Very
       nice. Pretty girl too!

        Thanks so much! Always such a beautiful subject!!!

       Oy! I wonder if my camera has spot metering – I’ll have to look.
       How do you get your child to hold still for photo shoots? She’s
       gorgeous, but also looks quite a bit precocious. 🙂

        Looks great! Thanks for the tip!

       We share a common dilemma – limited subject matter. But I’m
       guessing your beautiful Katie is a much more cooperative model than
       my horses and burros. Your great tips for a backlit photo still
       apply though. Now if I can just get one of them to stand still in
       the right place long enough…
       Thanks!

        I’m terrible with the whole thirds & rules and stuff. Scott Kelby
       says the best time of day is early before the sun rises and after
       the sun sets. I’m terrible with sun spots myself. She’s a cutie.
     * http://www.letjoyresound.blogspot.com Alicia
       I like how you cropped it. The light just emanates from the photo
       and that is what photography is all about. The light really makes
       this photo more than anything, nice job.
     * http://kitchentent.wordpress.com/ Robin
        Awesome.
       And thanks for mentioning the simple processing steps you took to
       arrive at the final (beautiful) portrait.
       You rock, Miz Boo!

       Crud….I don’t want to break out my manual….sigh

       Backlight is great, but I must say I also like the light/shadow
       play in the first photo. It does give the photo depth. You could
       bring out her face a little more by using an layer mask on a curve
       balance that you invert and then dab the light back in at 25% –
       35%, but I do like it a lot.
     * Jodie
        ohhhh katie is sooooo precious. good job mom
     * http://www.lifeonanisland.com Melynnda
       Thanks again. Love the Freckles 🙂
     * Kat
       Great tip! One question though… I thought aperture was relative to
       the focal length. As the first photo is taken with focal lenght
       20mm and the second 55mm, f/4 is a larger aperture for the second
       photo – contributing to the lighter result. Or something like that.
       No? Quote Wikipedia: “The amount of light captured by a lens is
       proportional to the area of the aperture, equal to: Area = Pi *
       (f/2N)^2, where f is focal lenght and N is the f-number.” So, same
       aperture, higher focal length gives larger area and more light.
       This confuses me, but it helped to explane it to myself here. Thank
       you.
     * Erik
        That child takes my breath away every time I see a photo of her!
       Great photos too, btw!

   Strict Key Lime Adherents: Please look away. I haven’t got time for the
   pain.

   Everyone else: Let’s make Key Lime Pie! Using regular limes! Because
   that’s all I have available in my small town! And I don’t live in
   Florida! So I can’t grow my own! Key limes!

   I’m still calling it Key Lime Pie, though—no one can stop me. Not even
   you Strict Key Lime Adherents.

   But I love ya anyway.

   Before I proceed, I would like to state that I am currently obsessed
   with refrigerator pies: pies that require refrigeration (to facilitate
   setting) before serving. These pies often have a graham cracker or
   other cookie crust, which I think is at the basis of my current
   obsession. They’re just making my skirt fly up right now. Can’t explain
   why.

   I chose Key Lime Pie for today’s pie recipe (I have a second one coming
   tomorrow) because I love the movie “Heartburn”. At the end of the
   movie, just after Meryl Streep’s character, a food writer named Rachel,
   discovers that Jack Nicholson’s character, a political columnist named
   Mark, has just spent their savings on a down payment for a new necklace
   for his mistress, a tall, leggy European named Thelma with whom he’d
   had an affair months earlier, Rachel bakes a Key Lime Pie with the sole
   intention of smashing it into Mark’s face at a dinner party later that
   night.

   And she does it.

   And frumpy, disheveled housewives everywhere CHEERED!

   And then we got really dang depressed.

   But that’s what pie is for: movie-induced depression.

   By the way, are you aware the story of “Heartburn” is loosely based on
   the marriage between Norah Ephron and Carl Bernstein?

   Anyway, that’s why I decided to make Key Lime Pie.


   REE_0094 We’ve got to begin by making a good graham cracker crust. Put
   18 graham crackers (that means the full rectangle) into a food
   processor.


   REE_0102 Pulse until totally crumbled. You could also put the crackers
   into large Ziploc bags, hand them to your sons, and say “Have at ’em,
   boys.” It’ll just take a minute or two.


   REE_0104 Pour the crumbs into a bowl.


   REE_0105 Then throw in a little sugar.


   REE_0106 Or a lot, if that floats your boat.

   It usually floats mine nicely.


   REE_0112 Some butter. Regular, please. This concoction needs the salt.


   REE_0114 Melt it in the microwave.


   REE_0116 Then just drizzle the butter over the crumbs.


   REE_0122


   REE_0123 Stir the mixture with a fork.


   REE_0126 It should be moist, but still very crumbly.


   REE_0128 Pour the crumbs into a pie pan.


   REE_0134 Using your fingers, press the crumbs gently so that they form
   a crust on the bottom and sides of the pan. Again, don’t expect the
   crumbs to stick together like glue; the crust should easily crumble if
   you mess with it too much.

   Now just bake the crust in a 350-degree oven for about 5 minutes. This
   will toast it up a little bit and cause the crust to set.


   REE_0097 Grab some limes. If you have Key Limes, yahoo! If you don’t,
   grab some of these regular peasants.


   REE_0139 Now zest a couple of them. You’ll need a heaping tablespoon of
   zest.

   And if you don’t have a microplane zester, please obtain one at your
   earliest convenience.

   And when you do: run the zester over the lime—not the other way around.


   REE_0136 Now halve and squeeze the puppies until you have 1/2 cup of
   juice.


   REE_0100 Now dig around your fridge until you find two eggs. Heave a
   sigh of relief. Then scribble “eggs” on your grocery list.


   REE_0143 Separate the eggs. You just need the yolks for this one.


   REE_0144 Now, throw the lime juice and the lime zest into the bowl of
   your electric mixer.


   REE_0145 Then add the egg yolks and beat immediately on high for one
   minute.


   REE_0148 Turn off the mixer, then pour in 1 can of sweetened, condensed
   milk.

   It’s good stuff. I promise you that.


   REE_0151 Mix it on high until thick and smooth.


   REE_0155 If the mixture looks like it needs more zest, add it right in!


   REE_0160 When it’s all mixed, just pour it into the crust.


   REE_0165


   REE_0168 Oh, honey.


   REE_0174 I love you so much.

   Now bake it in the oven for about fifteen minutes, or until no longer
   jiggly.

   Then remove it from the oven, allow it to cool for a little while, then
   stick it into the fridge to chill for at least an hour. A couple of
   hours is better. You just want it to be nice and chilled and firm and
   perfect.


   REE_0236 Like this.

   Oh, how I love Key Lime Pie Sorta.

   Now, here’s my stance on Key Lime Pie Sorta: it needs sweetened whipped
   cream. It could be that I’m overly sensitive to tart flavors and I need
   the whipped cream to balance it out. Or it could be that I just look
   for justification for putting more cream into my diet.

   Either way, whipped cream makes it better.

   And here’s how you make it:


   REE_0230 Pour about a cup of cold, heavy cream into the (clean) bowl of
   the mixer. Then add in a healthy tablespoon or two of sugar. You can
   also add a little vanilla, but we don’t really need it here.


   REE_0233 Then just beat it on high speed…


   REE_0239 Until it’s very stiff. Perfect!


   REE_0240 Now comes the fun part.


   REE_0241


   REE_0244 Mmmm. You can see that the crust is rather thick in relation
   to the filling. This is by design; as much as I love the creamy
   filling, I do find it pretty rich. With the ample crust and whipped
   cream on top, it turns out to be a really balanced piece of pie…and
   that lime flavor still really bursts through.


   REE_0251 A little extra zest on top totally seals the deal.


   REE_0260 Oh, man. I’m so ready for the next five (okay, three) minutes
   to happen.


   REE_0262 It’s…it’s…it’s happening.


   REE_0265 It happened.

   And now it can happen to you!

   Preheat oven to 350 degrees
   For the crust:
   Crush crackers in a food processor or Ziploc bag. Pour them into a bowl
   and stir in sugar and melted butter. Press into a pie pan and bake for
   5 minutes or until golden and set. Remove from oven and set aside to
   cool slightly.
   For the filling:
   Mix lime zest, lime juice, and egg yolks in a mixing bowl. Add in
   condensed milk and mix on high until smooth and thick. Pour mixture
   into crust and bake for 15 minutes.
   Remove from oven, allow to cool, then refrigerate for at least 1
   hour—more if possible.
   Serve with sweetened whipped cream and more grated lime zest.

        I love Key Lime Pie! The mix of tart and sweet, crunchy crust and
       thick creamy filling…. it’s divine.

        Love it! But I like the tart filling better than the crust. I
       guess I’m just to sweet and need the tart to balance me out. That’s
       what my daughter says. Love that girl.

        My local grocery stores all stock key lime juice in bottles, right
       next to the Realemon. But if you buy it, you then have to fight
       with people over whether it’s “just plain wrong” to use bottled
       lime juice instead of fresh.
       In my opinion, if you get a pie out of the deal, use whatever is
       handy!

       I absolutely LOVE your site, Ree. It’s perfect for new brides like
       me — I’m sure you hear this all the time but I really appreciate
       the work you put here and your funny comments. My family loved some
       recipes that I made for Sunday dinner (lasagna and quesadillas).
       It’s a miracle seeing me in the kitchen now! I can’t wait to try
       the rest of your recipes. Thanks for inspiring. A warm thanks for
       the Philippines – Chris

   All parents have different connections with each of their children;
   that’s a universal fact of parenting, I think. Sure, we parents “love
   all our kids equally”—of course we do. The level of love, the intensity
   of love, the nature of the love we feel for our kids is the same. But
   as different and individual as each of our children is, so is the kind
   of connection we feel to each one. Can I get an “amen?” Amen.

   *Tap tap…this thing on?


   DSC_0496_0976 My younger daughter, for instance, is my heart; she’s as
   connected to me now as she was when she was six months old, and
   nursing, and sleeping between Marlboro Man and me in bed. The only
   difference now is, she’s not nursing anymore.

   *Shudder*


   My older son, on the other hand, positively lights up my face, and
   almost makes me gasp with love and devotion every time I see him,
   except the times he’s tried on every article of clothing in his room
   and subsequently dropped them on the floor. Then I want to deck him.


   punk1-copy Then there’s my oldest, who will always be my first baby, my
   first foray into parenting…and who’s also most like me in her tendency
   toward flitting around in another world most of the time. The kid’s
   weird, okay? But I like it.


   And my baby—oh my. He’s my baby, whether he’s two or eight or eighty.
   And no matter how old he is, I’ll always want to pick him up and hold
   him…and protect him from the cold, dark world.


   DSC_0051_4156 Marlboro Man also has different connections to each of
   our punks, and it’s so fun to observe his relationship with each of
   them. But with this one—our baby—there’s just something there.


   DSC_0052_4157 They’re always climbing on each other, always in some
   level of contact.


   DSC_0053_4158 My oldest, on the other hand, is more standoffish.


   DSC_0054_4159 She’s always looking around for one of the dogs. She
   likes the dogs.


   DSC_0055_4160 Meanwhile, Marlboro Man and our baby can’t stay away from
   each other.


   DSC_0057_4162


   DSC_0058_4163


   DSC_0059_4164 This is my favorite sight in the world. (The strong man
   holding the child part. Not the Mountain Dew part.)


   DSC_0061_4166 And I’ll never, ever get tired of it, even though it’s
   been going on for four years now…


   IMGA0008b

   This one’s vintage, from over three years ago. My baby was younger than
   one. Back when I had a point-and-shoot. Back in the lactation days.


   2066863490_a1b4212f85 This was last fall.


   2272993431_4965b483c3 This was last spring.


   2272991315_263e1661c6 And the love? The love is forever.

        I am laughing because I think I thought the two girls and two boys
       were each one girl and one boy when you posted about them… they
       look alike, so I thought the older one was the baby and… oh, man.
       More to love 😉
       That last picture is a-ma-zing.
     * Cindy Gentile
        I also have 4, and competely understand! My 3 girls are definitely
       individuals and I love them dearly. But, I must admit my little boy
       will always (!) have a special place in his mamas heart.

     * http://elisharose.blogspot.com Julie at Elisharose
       Very sweet. Yes, parents love all of there children, but they
       relate to each one differently because each child is different.
       Good post.
     * Penny Wolf
       It’s just what it should be,a unique love individually.It triggers
       the relationships of ourselves as well with our own parents and
       siblings.It’s good to think about and remember
       jokes of “Mom likes me best”. 🙂
     * Melissa

   Testing

   One of the questions I am asked regularly is “How do you know your
   children are at level with other children their age in the public
   school system? Do they take standardized tests?”

   It is a difficult question to answer because I want to be informative,
   but gracious. Typically this question is asked by those challenging our
   choice to homeschool, but occasionally it’s asked by a parent genuinely
   seeking answers.

   My response is something like this–“I do not administer annual
   standardized testing so I cannot tell you whether or not my children
   are at level with other children their age in public schools. On the
   other hand, I also cannot be sure that the public school children are
   at the same level as my children.”

   And then I explain that homeschooling gives me the opportunity to sit
   and engage with my children daily, one-on-one, answering their every
   question, expanding upon their interests, re-directing and correcting
   immediately, as well as encouraging and helping them discover where and
   how to access the knowledge they need in any subject matter. In
   essence, I am there to lead them, so they understand how to learn, find
   joy in learning, and become lifetime learners.

   And all the while? I’m assessing them–even without a
   fill-in-the-circles scantron or a #2 pencil.

   Standardized Testing, as most educators will admit, is seriously
   flawed–and yet, much like an unfit dictator, it rules the public school
   system from the elementary years straight through to high school.
   Indeed standardized testing has morphed into a monster of epic
   proportions and invades the lives of teachers, students and families to
   a ridiculous degree.

   Completely capable teachers are saddled with unreasonable standards,
   relentless stress, and weeks and weeks of “test preparation” with their
   students. Parents are guilted into attending after-school meetings to
   watch Power Point presentations of how they can assist their children
   with the imminent tests. Teachers call to remind families to get their
   kids in bed early and feed them a hearty breakfast because the
   following day their children will undergo “the test”–or rather, “the
   first of many tests”. The reputation of teachers, principals,
   administrators and school districts hinge on these scores. And the sad
   thing is…the scores cannot accurately assess knowledge, understanding,
   intelligence or the instructional effectiveness of the school.

   In my opinion, and in the opinion of many teachers I know, they are a
   big waste of time. Not just a waste of time, but they sabotage
   opportunities for true knowledge and learning in the classroom.

Homeschoolers and Standardized Testing

   Thankfully, I live in Texas where standardized testing is not required
   for homeschoolers. Unfortunately, this is not the same for all states.
   For instance, Georgia requires children to take a national standardized
   achievement test every three years beginning at the end of third grade.

   If we did live in a state with this requirement, I would continue to
   teach my children in the same manner I do now. I am convinced children
   fare far better with daily, indulgent, experiential learning than from
   any amount of “test-coaching”, mindless worksheets and dull repetition.

   Teaching the test obliterates true learning–and teachers know it.
   Goals are important in a homeschool, but the manner in which we reach
   them is key.

   Reading, discussing, and yes, even playing are significantly stronger
   learning methods. These activities also allow parents plenty of
   opportunities to assess knowledge.

   For instance, when Kenny and I reviewed his new spelling words on
   Monday he misspelled “cough” and “graph”. We discussed the words,
   reviewed the related rules, and the next day he spelled “graph”
   correctly, but still missed “cough”. Another short review and the boy
   now can spell “cough”.

   I might randomnly ask him (for instance, when he was sorting the
   recycling), “Hey Kenny, how do you spell cough?” He spells it for me.
   He knows it. The next afternoon in the car I might say, “Hey Kenny,
   remind me how to spell ‘cough’.” With a knowing smirk, he spells the
   word correctly again. There wasn’t a need to administer a test to teach
   those two words–or to assure myself he scored 100% on a weekly spelling
   list.

But What About College?

   A reader named Joy wrote me and said, “I was reading an article in an
   online homeschooling booklet from a college professor and he was
   talking about…problem areas he sees in his students who have been
   homeschooled…their test taking skills are lacking. The test taking has
   actually been a big question in my mind. If your kids are going on to
   college, how do you prepare them for that? I was a horrible test taker
   so maybe that’s why I am so concerned about it.”

   I can only speak from experience, but I have yet to meet a homeschooled
   child that isn’t versed in test-taking. Most homeschooled kids will
   experience any number of classes outside of their home–be it a
   community college dual-credit course, a co-op, or even online
   accredited courses, before heading off to college.

   Some may even participate in individual courses at private schools to
   take advantage of labs (Biology) or participate in Science
   Projects/Oral Presentations.

   And of course, kids of all educational backgrounds are aware of the
   college-preparatory courses they can take advantage of when they are
   ready to take the required SAT and ACT.

   When parents choose to teach their children how to learn, instead of
   how to test, the children will naturally be better equipped for their
   college years. A college student with a homeschooling background
   already understands their own personal responsibility and has mastered
   self-management–two very important traits needed in college. Not only
   that, when homeschoolers are encouraged to listen, engage, and discuss
   their areas of study, they will not struggle later on with testing,
   focus, reading or writing. These things will more likely be second
   nature to them.

   So, you tell me is TEST just another four-letter word? How do you
   handle it in your own homeschool? If you are a public school teacher
   what is your opinion–do you think standardized testing is the
   “bees-knees?”

       I wonder how much our opinion of standardized testing is formed by
       how we felt about taking tests when we were in school. I never
       hated taking tests in school. Now, I’ve worked at two different
       community colleges, in a position where one of my responsibilities
       was to assess (or help assess) student learning. I’ve also taken a
       graduate level course on high stakes testing. And I still don’t
       think that tests, even standardized or high-stakes tests, are a bad
       thing. I think a test could be very badly formed, or used very
       badly, but I do not think that completely dismissing tests is
       valid. An awful lot of research has gone into developing some of
       the tests out there, and while they may not be perfect, they are
       not a bad way to measure or assess learning. I also think being
       able to “test well” is a useful skill to have. OMSH, I love reading
       your posts, and I highly respect your approach to teaching and
       homeschooling. I think you have a love of learning and are doing a
       wonderful job of instilling that in your children. I was actually a
       bit surprised that you are so completely opposed to tests, but I
       don’t doubt that your children are great learners.
       In general, though, I think we are doing children a disservice in
       moving toward a sort of customized education. People talk now about
       the “age of entitlement,” or how the current generation is growing
       up with this sense of entitlement, and it’s not a compliment. Maybe
       this is an unstoppable development, and the job community is just
       going to have to adjust. But the way I see it is that we are
       teaching our children not just that they have unique ways of
       learning, but that we are going to take care of that for them and
       do all the work for them. We are going to come to them and assess
       them; we will determine their strengths and weaknesses, and then we
       will develop the best methods of learning for them that play into
       their strengths. The first problem I see is that they will go out
       into the “real world” not having any idea how to determine their
       own strengths, or how to sell their strengths, or how to set up
       their work environments to play into their strengths. The second
       problem I see is that they will learn they only need to use their
       strengths and won’t ever be expected to use their weaknesses.
       I do not at all think that we have a good education system right
       now. (In all my defending of testing, I still think we have a very
       broken system that needs lots of help.) But I don’t think
       customized learning, at least the way it seems to be developing
       right now, along with complete elimination of testing, is the right
       way to go. I think we should teach students how to figure out their
       own strengths, and then how to use those strengths to learn and to
       do things they may not like (like testing). I also think we should
       teach students how to strengthen their weaknesses.

       We also choose not to administer tests on a regular basis. I find
       they retain much more of the information if they simply discuss the
       material with me or each other. They also seem to begin to make
       connections better as they discuss. I might hear “did you know that
       Mozart was a young boy when the American Revolution was starting…”
       I would hate to give up time to teach to a test. I would rather
       spend that time encouraging their interests and reading great
       books. I feel for some of our terrific teachers that are caught by
       the requirements of the system to spend a lot of time preparing
       children for a test. I have a child who will graduate this year and
       she is already accepted to college and I do not foresee any test
       taking difficulties. She has taken the ACT and has also taken tests
       in some of the high school classes we have taken outside our home.

       You are so very right! Standardized testing is not a valid way to
       measure knowledge. There is no way, for the vast majority of
       children, that a score on a standardized test truly reflects the
       quality of what they know. It can’t. Learning cannot be measured in
       such a sterile, disconnected manner. It is a complete and total
       waste of time, money, resources and obviously has done absolutely
       nothing to improve the “product” of government run schools. When
       the “one-size-fits-all” mentality of education that segregates by
       age, which has absolutely NO validity when measuring true knowledge
       or ability, rules in the school system it requires dealing with the
       “process” in a “herd mentality” manner. Standardized testing is a
       simple way to quantify, so that those numbers can be recorded for
       “the herd”. Somehow that is supposed to validate the test. It’s
       completely backward! But when that score becomes THE STANDARD
     * http://www.iliveinanantbed.blogspot.com I Live in an Antbed
       it becomes the “target”. And everything valid and good in the
       learning process is sacrificed on the “altar” of THE TEST. Now,
       guess whether or not we use standardized testing in our homeschool!
       (Somehow I posted before I finished–ooooops!) 🙂

       I, unfortunately, live in a state (PA) where we have to do
       Standardized testing in 3rd, 5th and 8th grades. 🙁 I really don’t
       like it at all, but we have to do it. Last year, when my son was in
       3rd grade, he had his first Standardized test and it wasn’t pretty.
       The school district said “Anything we can do to help?” Um, no
       thanks! 🙂 He is not good at those kinds of testing. I didn’t
       realize they taught the tests in other schools. No wonder they do
       better since they are taught it before they take it! I think it’s a
       waste of time. Maybe we’ll move to Texas! 🙂
     * Nicole
       I was home schooled from second grade until I graduated. We didn’t
       do testing and I progressed at my own pace. I graduated early and
       am now in college with a 3.5 GPA. More importantly though, I feel
       like I am retaining all of the information from previous classes
       better than my peers. When I study I am truly learning instead of
       studying for a test.

       Amen… and amen! I was a public school teacher and felt the stress
       first-hand. And, as hard as I tried, I couldn’t help from passing
       that stress along to my students.
       My son is in public school (4th grade) and we will be moving to
       another state in a few months. I have been so worried about his
       taking a new standardized test that he hasn’t been “prepped” for
       all year. So, thank you. Because of your post, I’ve given myself
       permission to not worry about a number on test results. I know my
       son and I know he is exactly where he needs to be.
     * eve
       i was wondering where you purchased the book your son is looking
       at. the usborne book of knowledge. i am slowly building my own
       library and am always on the lookout for goog informative books!!

       This is a terrific post! We did ITBS testing early on in
       homeschooling, mostly because I felt insecure and needed some
       objective reassurance that I was giving my son what he needed. He
       did great and I really haven’t worried about it since. We will do
       it again this spring because he will be applying to a charter high
       school next year (for the following school year) and I am bracing
       myself for skepticism about homeschooling. It might well be an
       unfounded concern, but if someone questions us, I want to be able
       to whip out those test scores (and try not to beat them over the
       head with them).
     * Michelle
       I must first say that I would LOVE to homeschool my kids! My
       daughter is getting a good education in public school but not as
       good as she would at home. There are several reasons I don’t –
       mostly fear I admit. That being said I have to pose the question –
       if you don’t administer some kind of standardized tests, how do you
       catch the kids whose homeschooling parents are failing them? I am
       on familiar terms with several homeschooling families and most are
       fantastic educators. There is one family, however that has failed
       to even teach their teenaged children to read. I know that they are
       the exception and we shouldn’t rule by exception. What safety net
       do we have for these poor dears?
     * Carole
       We live in Ohio and have the choice of testing or having a teacher
       look through the work the kids have completed and sign off on
       it….we choose not to test. Last year at my son’s annual physical,
       his doctor actually asked me if that was legal! I love the fact
       that I’m teaching my children how to learn and to find the
       information they want/need instead of just teaching them facts that
       they can spit out on command.
     * Emily
       I was homeschooled throughout my education and found that when I
       got to university I excelled at test-taking, more than most of my
       peers. We did a little bit of testing in homeschooling, but not
       very much at all. What we did do was learn how to learn. Workbooks
       introduce you to the format of testing (write an answer to this
       question, multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank etc.) without the
       pressure of performing. You then have the opportunity to review
       where you made your mistakes and correct them, rather than just a
       final mark you must live with. I took Intro to Psychology in first
       year university and HATED it. I attended classes but honestly never
       took a note or cracked a book. I’m not saying this is a GOOD thing,
       but I did wind up getting an A in the class anyway, much better
       than many of my friends who actually studied hard, because grades
       were all based on multiple choice testing. Thanks to years of
       practice, I was really good at thinking critically, instinctively
       eliminating choices that didn’t make sense and making a smart
       guess. I knew how to use my brain rather than just over-study and
       panic about the exams. I thank my mother for that!
     * http://itwasbroughtonbylove.blogspot.com Southern Gal
       One of our legal options requires testing from 3rd though 12th
       grades. Homeschooling moms are not allowed to see any part of the
       test so there’s no fear of teaching to the test (which is actually
       a blessing). The funny thing about it is homeschoolers collectively
       score higher on the test than public school students do. It’s
       definitely a flawed system. We’ve learned through the years that
       standardized testing is a tool.
       (And to ignore the history and science sections completely!)
       As far as testing in our home, I’m not doing as much of it with my
       youngest as I did with his siblings. Different curriculum.
       Different approach.

       I don’t homeschool my kids…yet. I haven’t ruled it out for the
       future but for now they have a great kindergarten teacher. But,
       before I had kids I was an art teacher and although I didn’t
       administer standardized tests in my class I still administered the
       yearly tests. All the teachers hated it. Yes, I do think they are
       worthless and don’t help real learning. I think our whole public
       education needs to be revamped or switched to charter schools. As a
       former educator I don’t hold too much value in yearly standardized
       test results. They stress kids and teachers out and do nothing but
       waste valuable learning time.
     * Christy
       Yes, yes and yes!! Love what you wrote. As a former teacher I
       second what you said about the disproportionate emphasis placed on
       standardized tests, and the necessity to teach to the test as
       opposed to teaching your students well. And a standardized tests,
       while a good attempt at something, are fraught with problems. I am
       currently homechooling my two children and I just love how
       effectively I can teach them. I can correct their mistakes promptly
       without them learning incorrectly and then having to re-learn. I
       can slow down and focus on an area where they are particularly weak
       until they master it. When we hit an area they already know well,
       we can review it briefly and move on. You just cannot beat the
       teacher-student ratio of one to one!
       As far as homeschoolers being bad test takers, I would have to
       agree with you. I know a lot of homeschoolers and most of them know
       an awful lot! Most of them do very well in college. I know as a
       teacher each year typically recieved a previous homeschooler into
       my class, and while there were sometimes skills the child lacked,
       the reason they were now in school was bc their parents recognized
       that homeschooling wasn’t working for them. At the same time, those
       home schooled kids didn’t lack anything extraordinary. There were
       plenty of ‘regular’ schooled kids who lacked the same skills. I
       talked with one person once, who had taught for years and she said
       homeschoolers lacked social skills, and while I bet you many do, I
       would also say a lot of schooled children do to! I had to work one
       on one one with some of my students to help them learn social
       skills.
       I think standardized testing can help at times and can be useful,
       but not to the crazy extent that is pushed these days.
     * Sarah
       This is a wonderful post! As a former teacher your description of
       standardized tests is spot on. And yet many politicians and parents
       (and yes even a few teachers) can’t see any other way. If we don’t
       find a better system for educating the masses, we are in trouble. I
       don’t homeschool (and since my kids are pre-K, let me clarify, I
       don’t plan to) but I will be actively engaged in my childs
       learning. School cant end at 3, and learning doesnt end when the
       homework is finished. We have to push ourselves to ask teaching
       questions in every conversation with our kids.
       Thanks for your insight.
     * rachel
       as a public school teacher let me just say that standardized
       testing is NOT the bees knees. it is a major reason for why i want
       to homeschool my own kiddos when they reach school age (which by
       the way is way too young and developmentally inappropriate).
     * jen
       very great article, agree completely! my husband and i were talking
       about this issue after the SOTU, wondering how many Americans
       understand that when the president was speaking about education
       reform and ‘rating’ the teachers/schools and handing out money
       based on who does the best, he was talking about standardized
       testing. sadly, in my kindergarten son’s class here in georgia,
       they have no art, music, PE, or handwriting (and the child’s
       writing is horrible!), and they are still learning letters and
       numbers. i have struggled with the decision to homeschool, but my
       son can read and do simple math, is getting NOTHING from school,
       and already they are prepping them for The Test to the exclusion of
       everything else. it bothers me and has prompted me to enter the
       world of homeschooling. love this blog, and the comment/discussion
       section, thank-you all for being a great resource for those of us
       just getting started.

       There is a great tradition of teaching in my family, including my
       grandmother who graduated from Sam Houston and taught in a one room
       school house. I was excited to carry on this tradition. I taught in
       public schools in Texas and understand the stress and demands of
       standardized testing. Not only did we have to drill and teach to
       the test, anything deemed not essential to the test was neglected.
       I wanted to incorporate poetry into my lesson plans and was told
       that it could wait until after the writing test. The joy of
       teaching was tested out of me. Fast forward ten years, and my son
       is in third grade. He will take the TAKS test for the first time in
       a few weeks, and he has already said he is nervous. The third grade
       team also sent home a letter explaining that 10 points would be
       taken off every answer, even if it is correct, if the student did
       not show a strategy and their work. I really hoped that it would be
       different for my children, but things like this are causing me to
       seriously consider home schooling. If my grandmother could teach a
       whole school full of kids, I guess I can teach my three sons.

       I am I public school teacher in Texas, and I think the test is
       awful. Disclaimer: I am a music teacher, so I am not teaching in a
       tested content area, but the test causes so many problems in the
       arts, from pullouts for tutorin to cancelled rehearsals and
       students being told their interests don’t matter. I could go on for
       hours. This is one of the reasons my husband and I are keeping
       homeschooling as an option on the table for when we have kids. I
       want them to have the chance to think instead of regurgitate.
     * Robin
       In our state, we have a choice of evaluation between standardized
       testing (that I administer) or having a certified school teacher
       look over our portfolios. Frankly, with 4 children, its a pain to
       set up an appointment to see a teacher so we do testing. We take a
       week off in the spring to do the tests and my children look forward
       to it. When I first told them that we were going to take some time
       off for testing, with “fun time” after, they were really excited.
       “You mean, bubble tests??” they exclaimed. Yep, testing is a
       “treat” in my house. I have no idea what questions are on the test
       beforehand, so I don’t “teach to the test” and my children have
       always done fine. I actually seek out a more comprehensive test
       every few years to really gauge where they are. I’ve had no
       problems with this approach.

       I taught students with disabilities and we were on an alternate
       assessment, more of a review of my program. It was stressful, it
       was difficult, but that assessment helped me get some of the
       students I served in the door of classrooms that might have been
       closed to them, because the alternate setting was encouraged by the
       portfolio system that was in place. It wasn’t a standardized test
       though. I wish that it’s how we could evaluate all teachers’
       classrooms because it looked at the content being taught and the
       methods, how we integrated technology, and how worked with other
       teachers and people in the community. It took into account that
       different students had different abilities and strengths and that
       they wouldn’t all be able to do the same things in the same way.
       For our home school, the oldest is in kindergarten, so we aren’t
       testing, except for a pretest for a math book (I didn’t tell her it
       was a test) and I did use a reading evaluation, just so I have a
       benchmark for what we’re learning. I may incorporate some testing,
       just as an incentive for her, since she likes a challenge, and we
       live in a testing state, so I will teach her how to bubble in and
       some basic test taking skills, but no major change to how we home
       school. They can force her into school if she scores too low, so
       there is a bit of an incentive. I think that if she doesn’t get too
       bored with the test that she’ll do fine though.

       My kids wouldn’t know a test if it jumped out and bit them!!! But I
       can say I have learnt so much more from learning by following
       trails and exploring ideas than I ever learnt in school when
       everything was geared toward passing the next test!!! Hopefully my
       kids will survive testing when they have to and I am hoping their
       fabulous accumulated knowledge will stand them in good stead for
       their college entry exams!!!

       As a retired educator I sooo agree with ya about the standardized
       testing. We were required as teachers to lift the level of the
       scores every blessed year. Regular room teachers end up teaching
       for the ‘test’. Our Special Ed. students were required to take the
       very same test per grade level as the ‘regular’ students. In our
       community we have a large number of ‘remedial’ students, thus
       lowerin’ the over~all score compiled. What the heck is that all
       about???
       Just sayin’………..
       God bless you sweet Mamas who put forth the effort necessary to
       educate your children. Four outta eight of my grandkiddos are
       homeschooled and are thriving far beyond their peers. Do I get an
       AMEN????
       Have a beautiful day ya’ll!!!! :o)
     * Teresa
       I am in the minority. I test my child at the end of each school
       year with a PASS test purchased it from an umbrella school. Over
       two days she takes the scantron test, I mail it off, they grade it,
       and send me back a report of how she is performing relative to the
       national standard and relative to their students. This has been
       valuable to my family in several ways.
       1. I have a year to year view of her overall progress and a general
       idea of how much she is retaining long term from earlier years. If
       she drops from the 90+% to the 70% in a subject, I know to provide
       extra instruction and opportunity in that area.
       2. As the mother of an ADHD student, having written validation that
       she is learning even when it doesn’t look like it is nice. Having
       independent verification that she isn’t getting something, which
       means I don’t hear, “Nothing I do is ever good enough for you?”
       Priceless.
       3. Showing my child who believes that if she doesn’t get something
       easily the first time that she’s not smart enough how her
       performance stacks up to other children in her grade has been a
       huge confidence builder for her.
       4. Should the unthinkable happen and she has to attend public
       school, I have a 3rd party verification of her academic
       achievement. Our local school district is generally fair-minded in
       allowing homeschool students to enter at grade level, but the
       process is too subjective in my opinion.

   roasted red peppers into so many different recipes, from soups to
   sauces to panini to dips. The flavor is mild and slightly sweet, and

How I Shoot Silhouettes

A Backlit Photo in Full Sun

   Perhaps there are many ways to do this; I just know one. So I will
   share with you my best kept secret. You won’t tell anyone, right? And
   please, don’t hate me for using my Katie again. She’s all I’ve got. But
   I’m getting ready to give you a great tip—one that you can really
   use—so we’ll be even, okay?

   Here’s what I know.

   To take a picture in full sun, you must:

   First, put your camera on Spot Metering. This way your camera will read
   the light from your subject’s face. (To learn how to put your camera on
   Spot Metering, break out you camera’s manual!)

   Now, position your subject so that there is no sun hitting his/her
   face. You do not want white blotches. So walk around a bit, and have
   your model turn her head until you find the right spot.

   But also, while you are doing this, you need to make sure that your
   subject has light behind him/her, and that YOU have light behind you.
   (In other words, make sure you’re not standing under a tree or with
   your back against a building or anything that would block light.)

   The other night when I first went outside to take a few shots, I forgot
   this part of the rule. I was standing under a tree, so there was no
   light bouncing back onto Katie’s face.

   So you see, she does not have enough light on her face despite the fact
   that I did all the other things correctly. This picture is too dark for
   me to want to edit it.

   20080711_4401-ree
   Exposure: 0.01 sec (1/100)
   Aperture: f/4
   Focal Length: 20 mm
   ISO Speed: 100

   So we repositioned ourselves on the other side of the tree, where I had
   lots of light behind me. So did Katie.

   20080711_4433
   Exposure: 0.01 sec (1/100)
   Aperture: f/4
   Focal Length: 55 mm
   ISO Speed: 100

   Look at that. The exposure and the aperture are exactly the same. But
   this one is lighter. The only difference is that I have the light at my
   back on this one.

   Cool huh? This picture looks nice with a little editing because of the
   light.

   In this next one, you can see my shutter is 1/50. Just a little more
   light entered the camera. And this one is more to my liking.

   20080711_4410-soocree
   Exposure: 0.02 sec (1/50)
   Aperture: f/4
   Focal Length: 28 mm
   ISO Speed: 100

   20080711_4410-awm-ree
   For the final picture I sharpened, lightened, ran soft light, and
   cropped.

   I cropped it so that Katie wasn’t smack dab in the middle of the
   picture. I set her eyes along an imaginary line as I tried to follow
   the ‘rule of thirds.’

   But you’ll have to wait until next time, when we can discuss that
   artistic rule.

   Now, go out in that wonderful summer sun and give this a try! Unless
   you’re in Australia. Then you’ll have to settle for winter sun.

   Encourage one another,
   Miz Booshay

       Thank you Donna. I have always had trouble with full sun shots. I
       usually don’t get up early enough for the best light at dawn. And
       Katie is a fine subject.

        I love her eyes and freckles! Great pictures, as always!

       Thanks for the helpful hints. Darling girl! Love the freckles.

       Thank you! I’ve been seeing many beautiful pictures with backlight
       and I didn’t know how to do it! I keep many of your tips in mind
       and thank you for it!!!
     * Joy
        What a beautiful girl! Great shots
     * Ronda
        So that’s where I went wrong! I tried this with my daughter the
       other night, and all I got was a mess. I was sitting under a
       tree…no wonder! I’ll work on it again. Thanks for the secret tip!

        I like the up and down photo best.. third from the bottom. Very
       nice. Pretty girl too!

        Thanks so much! Always such a beautiful subject!!!

       Cool!!
     * Krissa
       Oy! I wonder if my camera has spot metering – I’ll have to look.
       How do you get your child to hold still for photo shoots? She’s
       gorgeous, but also looks quite a bit precocious. 🙂
     * http://www.viewfromthefishbowl.blogspot.com Ariel
        Looks great! Thanks for the tip!
     * http://the7msn.blogspot.com/ carson
       We share a common dilemma – limited subject matter. But I’m
       guessing your beautiful Katie is a much more cooperative model than
       my horses and burros. Your great tips for a backlit photo still
       apply though. Now if I can just get one of them to stand still in
       the right place long enough…
       Thanks!

        I’m terrible with the whole thirds & rules and stuff. Scott Kelby
       says the best time of day is early before the sun rises and after
       the sun sets. I’m terrible with sun spots myself. She’s a cutie.
     * http://www.letjoyresound.blogspot.com Alicia
       I like how you cropped it. The light just emanates from the photo
       and that is what photography is all about. The light really makes
       this photo more than anything, nice job.
     * http://kitchentent.wordpress.com/ Robin
        Awesome.
       And thanks for mentioning the simple processing steps you took to
       arrive at the final (beautiful) portrait.
       You rock, Miz Boo!

       Crud….I don’t want to break out my manual….sigh

       Backlight is great, but I must say I also like the light/shadow
       play in the first photo. It does give the photo depth. You could
       bring out her face a little more by using an layer mask on a curve
       balance that you invert and then dab the light back in at 25% –
       35%, but I do like it a lot.
     * Jodie
        ohhhh katie is sooooo precious. good job mom
     * http://www.lifeonanisland.com Melynnda
       Thanks again. Love the Freckles 🙂
     * Kat
       Great tip! One question though… I thought aperture was relative to
       the focal length. As the first photo is taken with focal lenght
       20mm and the second 55mm, f/4 is a larger aperture for the second
       photo – contributing to the lighter result. Or something like that.
       No? Quote Wikipedia: “The amount of light captured by a lens is
       proportional to the area of the aperture, equal to: Area = Pi *
       (f/2N)^2, where f is focal lenght and N is the f-number.” So, same
       aperture, higher focal length gives larger area and more light.
       This confuses me, but it helped to explane it to myself here. Thank
       you.
     * Erik
        That child takes my breath away every time I see a photo of her!
       Great photos too, btw!

Key Lime Pie

   Strict Key Lime Adherents: Please look away. I haven’t got time for the
   pain.

   Everyone else: Let’s make Key Lime Pie! Using regular limes! Because
   that’s all I have available in my small town! And I don’t live in
   Florida! So I can’t grow my own! Key limes!

   I’m still calling it Key Lime Pie, though—no one can stop me. Not even
   you Strict Key Lime Adherents.

   But I love ya anyway.

   Before I proceed, I would like to state that I am currently obsessed
   with refrigerator pies: pies that require refrigeration (to facilitate
   setting) before serving. These pies often have a graham cracker or
   other cookie crust, which I think is at the basis of my current
   obsession. They’re just making my skirt fly up right now. Can’t explain
   why.

   I chose Key Lime Pie for today’s pie recipe (I have a second one coming
   tomorrow) because I love the movie “Heartburn”. At the end of the
   movie, just after Meryl Streep’s character, a food writer named Rachel,
   discovers that Jack Nicholson’s character, a political columnist named
   Mark, has just spent their savings on a down payment for a new necklace
   for his mistress, a tall, leggy European named Thelma with whom he’d
   had an affair months earlier, Rachel bakes a Key Lime Pie with the sole
   intention of smashing it into Mark’s face at a dinner party later that
   night.

   And she does it.

   And frumpy, disheveled housewives everywhere CHEERED!

   And then we got really dang depressed.

   But that’s what pie is for: movie-induced depression.

   By the way, are you aware the story of “Heartburn” is loosely based on
   the marriage between Norah Ephron and Carl Bernstein?

   Anyway, that’s why I decided to make Key Lime Pie.


   REE_0094 We’ve got to begin by making a good graham cracker crust. Put
   18 graham crackers (that means the full rectangle) into a food
   processor.


   REE_0102 Pulse until totally crumbled. You could also put the crackers
   into large Ziploc bags, hand them to your sons, and say “Have at ’em,
   boys.” It’ll just take a minute or two.


   REE_0104 Pour the crumbs into a bowl.


   REE_0105 Then throw in a little sugar.


   REE_0106 Or a lot, if that floats your boat.

   It usually floats mine nicely.


   REE_0112 Some butter. Regular, please. This concoction needs the salt.


   REE_0114 Melt it in the microwave.


   REE_0116 Then just drizzle the butter over the crumbs.


   REE_0122


   REE_0123 Stir the mixture with a fork.


   REE_0126 It should be moist, but still very crumbly.


   REE_0128 Pour the crumbs into a pie pan.


   REE_0134 Using your fingers, press the crumbs gently so that they form
   a crust on the bottom and sides of the pan. Again, don’t expect the
   crumbs to stick together like glue; the crust should easily crumble if
   you mess with it too much.

   Now just bake the crust in a 350-degree oven for about 5 minutes. This
   will toast it up a little bit and cause the crust to set.


   REE_0097 Grab some limes. If you have Key Limes, yahoo! If you don’t,
   grab some of these regular peasants.


   REE_0139 Now zest a couple of them. You’ll need a heaping tablespoon of
   zest.

   And if you don’t have a microplane zester, please obtain one at your
   earliest convenience.

   And when you do: run the zester over the lime—not the other way around.


   REE_0136 Now halve and squeeze the puppies until you have 1/2 cup of
   juice.


   REE_0100 Now dig around your fridge until you find two eggs. Heave a
   sigh of relief. Then scribble “eggs” on your grocery list.


   REE_0143 Separate the eggs. You just need the yolks for this one.


   REE_0144 Now, throw the lime juice and the lime zest into the bowl of
   your electric mixer.


   REE_0145 Then add the egg yolks and beat immediately on high for one
   minute.


   REE_0148 Turn off the mixer, then pour in 1 can of sweetened, condensed
   milk.

   It’s good stuff. I promise you that.


   REE_0151 Mix it on high until thick and smooth.


   REE_0155 If the mixture looks like it needs more zest, add it right in!


   REE_0160 When it’s all mixed, just pour it into the crust.


   REE_0165


   REE_0168 Oh, honey.


   REE_0174 I love you so much.

   Now bake it in the oven for about fifteen minutes, or until no longer
   jiggly.

   Then remove it from the oven, allow it to cool for a little while, then
   stick it into the fridge to chill for at least an hour. A couple of
   hours is better. You just want it to be nice and chilled and firm and
   perfect.


   REE_0236 Like this.

   Oh, how I love Key Lime Pie Sorta.

   Now, here’s my stance on Key Lime Pie Sorta: it needs sweetened whipped
   cream. It could be that I’m overly sensitive to tart flavors and I need
   the whipped cream to balance it out. Or it could be that I just look
   for justification for putting more cream into my diet.

   Either way, whipped cream makes it better.

   And here’s how you make it:


   REE_0230 Pour about a cup of cold, heavy cream into the (clean) bowl of
   the mixer. Then add in a healthy tablespoon or two of sugar. You can
   also add a little vanilla, but we don’t really need it here.


   REE_0233 Then just beat it on high speed…


   REE_0239 Until it’s very stiff. Perfect!


   REE_0240 Now comes the fun part.


   REE_0241


   REE_0244 Mmmm. You can see that the crust is rather thick in relation
   to the filling. This is by design; as much as I love the creamy
   filling, I do find it pretty rich. With the ample crust and whipped
   cream on top, it turns out to be a really balanced piece of pie…and
   that lime flavor still really bursts through.


   REE_0251 A little extra zest on top totally seals the deal.


   REE_0260 Oh, man. I’m so ready for the next five (okay, three) minutes
   to happen.


   REE_0262 It’s…it’s…it’s happening.


   REE_0265 It happened.

   And now it can happen to you!

        Love it! But I like the tart filling better than the crust. I
       guess I’m just to sweet and need the tart to balance me out. That’s
       what my daughter says. Love that girl.

        My local grocery stores all stock key lime juice in bottles, right
       next to the Realemon. But if you buy it, you then have to fight
       with people over whether it’s “just plain wrong” to use bottled
       lime juice instead of fresh.
       In my opinion, if you get a pie out of the deal, use whatever is
       handy!

   All parents have different connections with each of their children;
   that’s a universal fact of parenting, I think. Sure, we parents “love
   all our kids equally”—of course we do. The level of love, the intensity
   of love, the nature of the love we feel for our kids is the same. But
   as different and individual as each of our children is, so is the kind
   of connection we feel to each one. Can I get an “amen?” Amen.

   *Tap tap…this thing on?


   DSC_0496_0976 My younger daughter, for instance, is my heart; she’s as
   connected to me now as she was when she was six months old, and
   nursing, and sleeping between Marlboro Man and me in bed. The only
   difference now is, she’s not nursing anymore.

   *Shudder*


   My older son, on the other hand, positively lights up my face, and
   almost makes me gasp with love and devotion every time I see him,
   except the times he’s tried on every article of clothing in his room
   and subsequently dropped them on the floor. Then I want to deck him.


   punk1-copy Then there’s my oldest, who will always be my first baby, my
   first foray into parenting…and who’s also most like me in her tendency
   toward flitting around in another world most of the time. The kid’s
   weird, okay? But I like it.


   And my baby—oh my. He’s my baby, whether he’s two or eight or eighty.
   And no matter how old he is, I’ll always want to pick him up and hold
   him…and protect him from the cold, dark world.


   DSC_0051_4156 Marlboro Man also has different connections to each of
   our punks, and it’s so fun to observe his relationship with each of
   them. But with this one—our baby—there’s just something there.


   DSC_0052_4157 They’re always climbing on each other, always in some
   level of contact.


   DSC_0053_4158 My oldest, on the other hand, is more standoffish.


   DSC_0054_4159 She’s always looking around for one of the dogs. She
   likes the dogs.


   DSC_0055_4160 Meanwhile, Marlboro Man and our baby can’t stay away from
   each other.


   DSC_0057_4162


   DSC_0058_4163


   DSC_0059_4164 This is my favorite sight in the world. (The strong man
   holding the child part. Not the Mountain Dew part.)


   DSC_0061_4166 And I’ll never, ever get tired of it, even though it’s
   been going on for four years now…

   This one’s vintage, from over three years ago. My baby was younger than
   one. Back when I had a point-and-shoot. Back in the lactation days.


   2066863490_a1b4212f85 This was last fall.


   2272993431_4965b483c3 This was last spring.


   2272991315_263e1661c6 And the love? The love is forever.

        Of course you get an Amen. Amen, Amen, Amen and Hallelujah! We
       only have one son, but he is our heart, our light, and the
       brightness brought to every day. I love nothing more than seeing
       him in the arms of his Daddy.
     * http://sprucehill.typepad.com/ Sarah S.
        Oh my! Those pictures! You are right the most attractive thing is
       watching your husband hold and play with your childeren! It is the
       sexiest thing in my book!

     * Randi from Hilton Head
        You just made me cry. Cherish your children everyone, they grow so
       fast and soon they will not want to be held. I am going to grab
       both of my little whippersnappers now!

        Very sweet post. Love the pictures.
     * http://thatgirlblogs.com that girl
        I am laughing because I think I thought the two girls and two boys
       were each one girl and one boy when you posted about them… they
       look alike, so I thought the older one was the baby and… oh, man.
       More to love 😉
       That last picture is a-ma-zing.
     * Cindy Gentile
        I also have 4, and competely understand! My 3 girls are definitely
       individuals and I love them dearly. But, I must admit my little boy
       will always (!) have a special place in his mamas heart.
     * http://www.thegreenhouseministries.com Greeneyes/ Martha
        There’s nothin’ like a great dad.
       And a great mom.
       Your kids are lucky kids!
       Have a fun family day!
     * http://elisharose.blogspot.com Julie at Elisharose
       Very sweet. Yes, parents love all of there children, but they
       relate to each one differently because each child is different.
       Good post.
     * Penny Wolf
       It’s just what it should be,a unique love individually.It triggers
       the relationships of ourselves as well with our own parents and
       siblings.It’s good to think about and remember
       jokes of “Mom likes me best”. 🙂
     * Melissa
        AMEN SISTA!!!!
     * rabidparadise

   Testing

   One of the questions I am asked regularly is “How do you know your
   children are at level with other children their age in the public
   school system? Do they take standardized tests?”

   It is a difficult question to answer because I want to be informative,
   but gracious. Typically this question is asked by those challenging our
   choice to homeschool, but occasionally it’s asked by a parent genuinely
   seeking answers.

   My response is something like this–“I do not administer annual
   standardized testing so I cannot tell you whether or not my children
   are at level with other children their age in public schools. On the
   other hand, I also cannot be sure that the public school children are
   at the same level as my children.”

   And then I explain that homeschooling gives me the opportunity to sit
   and engage with my children daily, one-on-one, answering their every
   question, expanding upon their interests, re-directing and correcting
   immediately, as well as encouraging and helping them discover where and
   how to access the knowledge they need in any subject matter. In
   essence, I am there to lead them, so they understand how to learn, find
   joy in learning, and become lifetime learners.

   And all the while? I’m assessing them–even without a
   fill-in-the-circles scantron or a #2 pencil.

   Standardized Testing, as most educators will admit, is seriously
   flawed–and yet, much like an unfit dictator, it rules the public school
   system from the elementary years straight through to high school.
   Indeed standardized testing has morphed into a monster of epic
   proportions and invades the lives of teachers, students and families to
   a ridiculous degree.

   Completely capable teachers are saddled with unreasonable standards,
   relentless stress, and weeks and weeks of “test preparation” with their
   students. Parents are guilted into attending after-school meetings to
   watch Power Point presentations of how they can assist their children
   with the imminent tests. Teachers call to remind families to get their
   kids in bed early and feed them a hearty breakfast because the
   following day their children will undergo “the test”–or rather, “the
   first of many tests”. The reputation of teachers, principals,
   administrators and school districts hinge on these scores. And the sad
   thing is…the scores cannot accurately assess knowledge, understanding,
   intelligence or the instructional effectiveness of the school.

   In my opinion, and in the opinion of many teachers I know, they are a
   big waste of time. Not just a waste of time, but they sabotage
   opportunities for true knowledge and learning in the classroom.

Homeschoolers and Standardized Testing

   Thankfully, I live in Texas where standardized testing is not required
   for homeschoolers. Unfortunately, this is not the same for all states.
   For instance, Georgia requires children to take a national standardized
   achievement test every three years beginning at the end of third grade.

   If we did live in a state with this requirement, I would continue to
   teach my children in the same manner I do now. I am convinced children
   fare far better with daily, indulgent, experiential learning than from
   any amount of “test-coaching”, mindless worksheets and dull repetition.

   Teaching the test obliterates true learning–and teachers know it.
   Goals are important in a homeschool, but the manner in which we reach
   them is key.

   Reading, discussing, and yes, even playing are significantly stronger
   learning methods. These activities also allow parents plenty of
   opportunities to assess knowledge.

   For instance, when Kenny and I reviewed his new spelling words on
   Monday he misspelled “cough” and “graph”. We discussed the words,
   reviewed the related rules, and the next day he spelled “graph”
   correctly, but still missed “cough”. Another short review and the boy
   now can spell “cough”.

   I might randomnly ask him (for instance, when he was sorting the
   recycling), “Hey Kenny, how do you spell cough?” He spells it for me.
   He knows it. The next afternoon in the car I might say, “Hey Kenny,
   remind me how to spell ‘cough’.” With a knowing smirk, he spells the
   word correctly again. There wasn’t a need to administer a test to teach
   those two words–or to assure myself he scored 100% on a weekly spelling
   list.

But What About College?

   A reader named Joy wrote me and said, “I was reading an article in an
   online homeschooling booklet from a college professor and he was
   talking about…problem areas he sees in his students who have been
   homeschooled…their test taking skills are lacking. The test taking has
   actually been a big question in my mind. If your kids are going on to
   college, how do you prepare them for that? I was a horrible test taker
   so maybe that’s why I am so concerned about it.”

   I can only speak from experience, but I have yet to meet a homeschooled
   child that isn’t versed in test-taking. Most homeschooled kids will
   experience any number of classes outside of their home–be it a
   community college dual-credit course, a co-op, or even online
   accredited courses, before heading off to college.

   Some may even participate in individual courses at private schools to
   take advantage of labs (Biology) or participate in Science
   Projects/Oral Presentations.

   And of course, kids of all educational backgrounds are aware of the
   college-preparatory courses they can take advantage of when they are
   ready to take the required SAT and ACT.

   When parents choose to teach their children how to learn, instead of
   how to test, the children will naturally be better equipped for their
   college years. A college student with a homeschooling background
   already understands their own personal responsibility and has mastered
   self-management–two very important traits needed in college. Not only
   that, when homeschoolers are encouraged to listen, engage, and discuss
   their areas of study, they will not struggle later on with testing,
   focus, reading or writing. These things will more likely be second
   nature to them.

   So, you tell me is TEST just another four-letter word? How do you
   handle it in your own homeschool? If you are a public school teacher
   what is your opinion–do you think standardized testing is the
   “bees-knees?”

       I wonder how much our opinion of standardized testing is formed by
       how we felt about taking tests when we were in school. I never
       hated taking tests in school. Now, I’ve worked at two different
       community colleges, in a position where one of my responsibilities
       was to assess (or help assess) student learning. I’ve also taken a
       graduate level course on high stakes testing. And I still don’t
       think that tests, even standardized or high-stakes tests, are a bad
       thing. I think a test could be very badly formed, or used very
       badly, but I do not think that completely dismissing tests is
       valid. An awful lot of research has gone into developing some of
       the tests out there, and while they may not be perfect, they are
       not a bad way to measure or assess learning. I also think being
       able to “test well” is a useful skill to have. OMSH, I love reading
       your posts, and I highly respect your approach to teaching and
       homeschooling. I think you have a love of learning and are doing a
       wonderful job of instilling that in your children. I was actually a
       bit surprised that you are so completely opposed to tests, but I
       don’t doubt that your children are great learners.
       In general, though, I think we are doing children a disservice in
       moving toward a sort of customized education. People talk now about
       the “age of entitlement,” or how the current generation is growing
       up with this sense of entitlement, and it’s not a compliment. Maybe
       this is an unstoppable development, and the job community is just
       going to have to adjust. But the way I see it is that we are
       teaching our children not just that they have unique ways of
       learning, but that we are going to take care of that for them and
       do all the work for them. We are going to come to them and assess
       them; we will determine their strengths and weaknesses, and then we
       will develop the best methods of learning for them that play into
       their strengths. The first problem I see is that they will go out
       into the “real world” not having any idea how to determine their
       own strengths, or how to sell their strengths, or how to set up
       their work environments to play into their strengths. The second
       problem I see is that they will learn they only need to use their
       strengths and won’t ever be expected to use their weaknesses.
       I do not at all think that we have a good education system right
       now. (In all my defending of testing, I still think we have a very
       broken system that needs lots of help.) But I don’t think
       customized learning, at least the way it seems to be developing
       right now, along with complete elimination of testing, is the right
       way to go. I think we should teach students how to figure out their
       own strengths, and then how to use those strengths to learn and to
       do things they may not like (like testing). I also think we should
       teach students how to strengthen their weaknesses.
     * Janell
       We also choose not to administer tests on a regular basis. I find
       they retain much more of the information if they simply discuss the
       material with me or each other. They also seem to begin to make
       connections better as they discuss. I might hear “did you know that
       Mozart was a young boy when the American Revolution was starting…”
       I would hate to give up time to teach to a test. I would rather
       spend that time encouraging their interests and reading great
       books. I feel for some of our terrific teachers that are caught by
       the requirements of the system to spend a lot of time preparing
       children for a test. I have a child who will graduate this year and
       she is already accepted to college and I do not foresee any test
       taking difficulties. She has taken the ACT and has also taken tests
       in some of the high school classes we have taken outside our home.

       You are so very right! Standardized testing is not a valid way to
       measure knowledge. There is no way, for the vast majority of
       children, that a score on a standardized test truly reflects the
       quality of what they know. It can’t. Learning cannot be measured in
       such a sterile, disconnected manner. It is a complete and total
       waste of time, money, resources and obviously has done absolutely
       nothing to improve the “product” of government run schools. When
       the “one-size-fits-all” mentality of education that segregates by
       age, which has absolutely NO validity when measuring true knowledge
       or ability, rules in the school system it requires dealing with the
       “process” in a “herd mentality” manner. Standardized testing is a
       simple way to quantify, so that those numbers can be recorded for
       “the herd”. Somehow that is supposed to validate the test. It’s
       completely backward! But when that score becomes THE STANDARD
     * http://www.iliveinanantbed.blogspot.com I Live in an Antbed
       it becomes the “target”. And everything valid and good in the
       learning process is sacrificed on the “altar” of THE TEST. Now,
       guess whether or not we use standardized testing in our homeschool!
       (Somehow I posted before I finished–ooooops!) 🙂

       I, unfortunately, live in a state (PA) where we have to do
       Standardized testing in 3rd, 5th and 8th grades. 🙁 I really don’t
       like it at all, but we have to do it. Last year, when my son was in
       3rd grade, he had his first Standardized test and it wasn’t pretty.
       The school district said “Anything we can do to help?” Um, no
       thanks! 🙂 He is not good at those kinds of testing. I didn’t
       realize they taught the tests in other schools. No wonder they do
       better since they are taught it before they take it! I think it’s a
       waste of time. Maybe we’ll move to Texas! 🙂
     * Nicole
       I was home schooled from second grade until I graduated. We didn’t
       do testing and I progressed at my own pace. I graduated early and
       am now in college with a 3.5 GPA. More importantly though, I feel
       like I am retaining all of the information from previous classes
       better than my peers. When I study I am truly learning instead of
       studying for a test.
     * Stephanie Fleming
       Amen… and amen! I was a public school teacher and felt the stress
       first-hand. And, as hard as I tried, I couldn’t help from passing
       that stress along to my students.
       My son is in public school (4th grade) and we will be moving to
       another state in a few months. I have been so worried about his
       taking a new standardized test that he hasn’t been “prepped” for
       all year. So, thank you. Because of your post, I’ve given myself
       permission to not worry about a number on test results. I know my
       son and I know he is exactly where he needs to be.
     * eve
       i was wondering where you purchased the book your son is looking
       at. the usborne book of knowledge. i am slowly building my own
       library and am always on the lookout for goog informative books!!
     * http://www.chrisworthy.com Chris
       This is a terrific post! We did ITBS testing early on in
       homeschooling, mostly because I felt insecure and needed some
       objective reassurance that I was giving my son what he needed. He
       did great and I really haven’t worried about it since. We will do
       it again this spring because he will be applying to a charter high
       school next year (for the following school year) and I am bracing
       myself for skepticism about homeschooling. It might well be an
       unfounded concern, but if someone questions us, I want to be able
       to whip out those test scores (and try not to beat them over the
       head with them).
     * Michelle
       I must first say that I would LOVE to homeschool my kids! My
       daughter is getting a good education in public school but not as
       good as she would at home. There are several reasons I don’t –
       mostly fear I admit. That being said I have to pose the question –
       if you don’t administer some kind of standardized tests, how do you
       catch the kids whose homeschooling parents are failing them? I am
       on familiar terms with several homeschooling families and most are
       fantastic educators. There is one family, however that has failed
       to even teach their teenaged children to read. I know that they are
       the exception and we shouldn’t rule by exception. What safety net
       do we have for these poor dears?
     * Carole
       We live in Ohio and have the choice of testing or having a teacher
       look through the work the kids have completed and sign off on
       it….we choose not to test. Last year at my son’s annual physical,
       his doctor actually asked me if that was legal! I love the fact
       that I’m teaching my children how to learn and to find the
       information they want/need instead of just teaching them facts that
       they can spit out on command.
     * Emily
       I was homeschooled throughout my education and found that when I
       got to university I excelled at test-taking, more than most of my
       peers. We did a little bit of testing in homeschooling, but not
       very much at all. What we did do was learn how to learn. Workbooks
       introduce you to the format of testing (write an answer to this
       question, multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank etc.) without the
       pressure of performing. You then have the opportunity to review
       where you made your mistakes and correct them, rather than just a
       final mark you must live with. I took Intro to Psychology in first
       year university and HATED it. I attended classes but honestly never
       took a note or cracked a book. I’m not saying this is a GOOD thing,
       but I did wind up getting an A in the class anyway, much better
       than many of my friends who actually studied hard, because grades
       were all based on multiple choice testing. Thanks to years of
       practice, I was really good at thinking critically, instinctively
       eliminating choices that didn’t make sense and making a smart
       guess. I knew how to use my brain rather than just over-study and
       panic about the exams. I thank my mother for that!
     * http://itwasbroughtonbylove.blogspot.com Southern Gal
       One of our legal options requires testing from 3rd though 12th
       grades. Homeschooling moms are not allowed to see any part of the
       test so there’s no fear of teaching to the test (which is actually
       a blessing). The funny thing about it is homeschoolers collectively
       score higher on the test than public school students do. It’s
       definitely a flawed system. We’ve learned through the years that
       standardized testing is a tool.
       (And to ignore the history and science sections completely!)
       As far as testing in our home, I’m not doing as much of it with my
       youngest as I did with his siblings. Different curriculum.
       Different approach.

       I don’t homeschool my kids…yet. I haven’t ruled it out for the
       future but for now they have a great kindergarten teacher. But,
       before I had kids I was an art teacher and although I didn’t
       administer standardized tests in my class I still administered the
       yearly tests. All the teachers hated it. Yes, I do think they are
       worthless and don’t help real learning. I think our whole public
       education needs to be revamped or switched to charter schools. As a
       former educator I don’t hold too much value in yearly standardized
       test results. They stress kids and teachers out and do nothing but
       waste valuable learning time.

       Yes, yes and yes!! Love what you wrote. As a former teacher I
       second what you said about the disproportionate emphasis placed on
       standardized tests, and the necessity to teach to the test as
       opposed to teaching your students well. And a standardized tests,
       while a good attempt at something, are fraught with problems. I am
       currently homechooling my two children and I just love how
       effectively I can teach them. I can correct their mistakes promptly
       without them learning incorrectly and then having to re-learn. I
       can slow down and focus on an area where they are particularly weak
       until they master it. When we hit an area they already know well,
       we can review it briefly and move on. You just cannot beat the
       teacher-student ratio of one to one!
       As far as homeschoolers being bad test takers, I would have to
       agree with you. I know a lot of homeschoolers and most of them know
       an awful lot! Most of them do very well in college. I know as a
       teacher each year typically recieved a previous homeschooler into
       my class, and while there were sometimes skills the child lacked,
       the reason they were now in school was bc their parents recognized
       that homeschooling wasn’t working for them. At the same time, those
       home schooled kids didn’t lack anything extraordinary. There were
       plenty of ‘regular’ schooled kids who lacked the same skills. I
       talked with one person once, who had taught for years and she said
       homeschoolers lacked social skills, and while I bet you many do, I
       would also say a lot of schooled children do to! I had to work one
       on one one with some of my students to help them learn social
       skills.
       I think standardized testing can help at times and can be useful,
       but not to the crazy extent that is pushed these days.

       This is a wonderful post! As a former teacher your description of
       standardized tests is spot on. And yet many politicians and parents
       (and yes even a few teachers) can’t see any other way. If we don’t
       find a better system for educating the masses, we are in trouble. I
       don’t homeschool (and since my kids are pre-K, let me clarify, I
       don’t plan to) but I will be actively engaged in my childs
       learning. School cant end at 3, and learning doesnt end when the
       homework is finished. We have to push ourselves to ask teaching
       questions in every conversation with our kids.
       Thanks for your insight.

       as a public school teacher let me just say that standardized
       testing is NOT the bees knees. it is a major reason for why i want
       to homeschool my own kiddos when they reach school age (which by
       the way is way too young and developmentally inappropriate).
     * jen
       very great article, agree completely! my husband and i were talking
       about this issue after the SOTU, wondering how many Americans
       understand that when the president was speaking about education
       reform and ‘rating’ the teachers/schools and handing out money
       based on who does the best, he was talking about standardized
       testing. sadly, in my kindergarten son’s class here in georgia,
       they have no art, music, PE, or handwriting (and the child’s
       writing is horrible!), and they are still learning letters and
       numbers. i have struggled with the decision to homeschool, but my
       son can read and do simple math, is getting NOTHING from school,
       and already they are prepping them for The Test to the exclusion of
       everything else. it bothers me and has prompted me to enter the
       world of homeschooling. love this blog, and the comment/discussion
       section, thank-you all for being a great resource for those of us
       just getting started.

       There is a great tradition of teaching in my family, including my
       grandmother who graduated from Sam Houston and taught in a one room
       school house. I was excited to carry on this tradition. I taught in
       public schools in Texas and understand the stress and demands of
       standardized testing. Not only did we have to drill and teach to
       the test, anything deemed not essential to the test was neglected.
       I wanted to incorporate poetry into my lesson plans and was told
       that it could wait until after the writing test. The joy of
       teaching was tested out of me. Fast forward ten years, and my son
       is in third grade. He will take the TAKS test for the first time in
       a few weeks, and he has already said he is nervous. The third grade
       team also sent home a letter explaining that 10 points would be
       taken off every answer, even if it is correct, if the student did
       not show a strategy and their work. I really hoped that it would be
       different for my children, but things like this are causing me to
       seriously consider home schooling. If my grandmother could teach a
       whole school full of kids, I guess I can teach my three sons.

       I am I public school teacher in Texas, and I think the test is
       awful. Disclaimer: I am a music teacher, so I am not teaching in a
       tested content area, but the test causes so many problems in the
       arts, from pullouts for tutorin to cancelled rehearsals and
       students being told their interests don’t matter. I could go on for
       hours. This is one of the reasons my husband and I are keeping
       homeschooling as an option on the table for when we have kids. I
       want them to have the chance to think instead of regurgitate.
     * Robin
       In our state, we have a choice of evaluation between standardized
       testing (that I administer) or having a certified school teacher
       look over our portfolios. Frankly, with 4 children, its a pain to
       set up an appointment to see a teacher so we do testing. We take a
       week off in the spring to do the tests and my children look forward
       to it. When I first told them that we were going to take some time
       off for testing, with “fun time” after, they were really excited.
       “You mean, bubble tests??” they exclaimed. Yep, testing is a
       “treat” in my house. I have no idea what questions are on the test
       beforehand, so I don’t “teach to the test” and my children have
       always done fine. I actually seek out a more comprehensive test
       every few years to really gauge where they are. I’ve had no
       problems with this approach.

       I taught students with disabilities and we were on an alternate
       assessment, more of a review of my program. It was stressful, it
       was difficult, but that assessment helped me get some of the
       students I served in the door of classrooms that might have been
       closed to them, because the alternate setting was encouraged by the
       portfolio system that was in place. It wasn’t a standardized test
       though. I wish that it’s how we could evaluate all teachers’
       classrooms because it looked at the content being taught and the
       methods, how we integrated technology, and how worked with other
       teachers and people in the community. It took into account that
       different students had different abilities and strengths and that
       they wouldn’t all be able to do the same things in the same way.
       For our home school, the oldest is in kindergarten, so we aren’t
       testing, except for a pretest for a math book (I didn’t tell her it
       was a test) and I did use a reading evaluation, just so I have a
       benchmark for what we’re learning. I may incorporate some testing,
       just as an incentive for her, since she likes a challenge, and we
       live in a testing state, so I will teach her how to bubble in and
       some basic test taking skills, but no major change to how we home
       school. They can force her into school if she scores too low, so
       there is a bit of an incentive. I think that if she doesn’t get too
       bored with the test that she’ll do fine though.

       My kids wouldn’t know a test if it jumped out and bit them!!! But I
       can say I have learnt so much more from learning by following
       trails and exploring ideas than I ever learnt in school when
       everything was geared toward passing the next test!!! Hopefully my
       kids will survive testing when they have to and I am hoping their
       fabulous accumulated knowledge will stand them in good stead for
       their college entry exams!!!

       As a retired educator I sooo agree with ya about the standardized
       testing. We were required as teachers to lift the level of the
       scores every blessed year. Regular room teachers end up teaching
       for the ‘test’. Our Special Ed. students were required to take the
       very same test per grade level as the ‘regular’ students. In our
       community we have a large number of ‘remedial’ students, thus
       lowerin’ the over~all score compiled. What the heck is that all
       about???
       Just sayin’………..
       God bless you sweet Mamas who put forth the effort necessary to
       educate your children. Four outta eight of my grandkiddos are
       homeschooled and are thriving far beyond their peers. Do I get an
       AMEN????
       Have a beautiful day ya’ll!!!! :o)

       I am in the minority. I test my child at the end of each school
       year with a PASS test purchased it from an umbrella school. Over
       two days she takes the scantron test, I mail it off, they grade it,
       and send me back a report of how she is performing relative to the
       national standard and relative to their students. This has been
       valuable to my family in several ways.
       1. I have a year to year view of her overall progress and a general
       idea of how much she is retaining long term from earlier years. If
       she drops from the 90+% to the 70% in a subject, I know to provide
       extra instruction and opportunity in that area.
       2. As the mother of an ADHD student, having written validation that
       she is learning even when it doesn’t look like it is nice. Having
       independent verification that she isn’t getting something, which
       means I don’t hear, “Nothing I do is ever good enough for you?”
       Priceless.
       3. Showing my child who believes that if she doesn’t get something
       easily the first time that she’s not smart enough how her
       performance stacks up to other children in her grade has been a
       huge confidence builder for her.
       4. Should the unthinkable happen and she has to attend public
       school, I have a 3rd party verification of her academic
       achievement. Our local school district is generally fair-minded in
       allowing homeschool students to enter at grade level, but the
       process is too subjective in my opinion.
