Corporate Social Responsibility

   NETGEAR is committed to ensuring the highest standards of social
   responsibility regardless of where our products are made. Under
   NETGEAR’s corporate social responsibility program there are five main
   pillars.

   Ethics

   Labor with Dignity

   Regulatory and Environmental Compliance

   Health and Safety

   Management Systems

   Being an applicant member of the Electronic Industry Citizenship
   Coalition (EICC), NETGEAR fully supports the vision and goals of the
   EICC. We endorse the EICC Code of Conduct, and incorporates EICC
   standards into the NETGEAR Corporate Supplier Code of Conduct. Our
   corporate social responsibility program includes various initiatives
   and monitoring activities which reinforce our commitment as a
   responsible global citizen. NETGEAR Internal Audit and Environmental
   Compliance conduct an annual risk assessment and perform audits on
   significant third party manufacturing locations at least once a year,
   which we target to cover no less than 80% of our total production.
   Results from audits are shared and agreed with suppliers, and supplier
   corrective action requests, if needed, are subsequently followed up
   during the Quarterly Business Review led by the Operations Department.
