            Low-Dose Colchicine after Myocardial Infarction J.-C. Tardif
            and Others publication image
            Inflammation appears to play a role in atherosclerosis,
            raising the possibility that treatments that reduce
            inflammation could prevent cardiovascular events. In a
            randomized, placebo-controlled trial involving 4745 patients
            with recent myocardial infarction, low-dose colchicine (0.5 mg
            once daily) prevented ischemic cardiovascular events.

            Reduced Leaflet Motion after TAVR O. De Backer and Others
            publication image
            In a trial, patients who had undergone successful TAVR were
            assigned to rivaroxaban or antiplatelet therapy. In this
            substudy in patients who underwent CT, leaflet thickening and
            reduced leaflet motion at 90 days were less common with
            rivaroxaban. However, in the main trial, rivaroxaban was
            associated with a higher risk of death or thromboembolic
            complications and a higher risk of bleeding.

            Asymptomatic patients with very severe aortic stenosis were
            randomly assigned to either early valve-replacement surgery or
            conservative care. At a median of 6 years of follow-up, the
            composite of operative mortality or death from cardiovascular
            causes occurred less frequently in the early-surgery group.

            regimen or an antiplatelet-based antithrombotic regimen. At 17

            A striking trend in medical education and practice over the
            past half century has been the decline in the rate of
            autopsies conducted throughout much of the world. But there is
            much we can learn from the dead, for both clinical and public
            health purposes.

            In this trial, patients with stroke or TIA and atherosclerosis
            who received a statin with or without ezetimibe were randomly
            assigned to an LDL cholesterol target of less than 70 mg per
            deciliter or to a target range of 90 to 110 mg per deciliter.
            At a median follow-up of 3.5 years, the incidence of a
            composite cardiovascular end point was 12% lower in the
            lower-target group than in the higher-target group. The
            incidence of cerebral hemorrhage did not differ significantly
            between the two groups.

            When his home palliative care patient asks him to sing for
            her, the physician hesitates. Boundary crossings create
            uncertainty and risk shifting the focus from the patient to
            the physician. Yet patients want physicians who aren’t robots,
            who are friendly and relatable.

            Management of serum cholesterol level is a central objective
            in preventing cardiovascular events. Current guidelines
            recommend calculation of cardiovascular risk, with treatment
            decisions based on these data and clinician–patient discussion
            of risk. Statins remain the first line of pharmacotherapy.

            with IV antihypertensive agents (based on the type of
            target-organ damage) in an ICU. In the absence of target-organ
            injury, treatment involves oral medication in the ambulatory

            Acute upper airway obstruction has varied causes with distinct

            basis for management, but improvements in equipment have
