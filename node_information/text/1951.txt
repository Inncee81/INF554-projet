   Zero Waste Uppsala

Do you know OLIO?

   Posted on September 2, 2019September 24, 2019 by ZeroWasteUppsala

   Zero Waste Uppsala discovered this app and loves their values!!

   It all started when a young woman named Tessa wanted to move from
   Switzerland to Great Britain. Everything was planned but unfortunately
   she ended up with some food leftovers she couldn’t finish or fit in her
   luggage. She refused to throw it away so she was looking for the woman
   who usually begs in front of the grocery store. But as fate has it, she
   wasn’t there. So Tessa was thinking, maybe her neighbours want some of
   her perfectly fresh yoghourts, cabbage or sweet potatoes? Standing in
   front of the door she didn’t dare to ring the bell, afraid of getting a
   “no”. But Tessa overcame her own fear and found a solution.

   With her new app OLIO you can get food directly to the people who want
   and need it! So now, not only Tessa but also you and your friends can
   benefit! You are leaving for some days and have some leftovers? Just
   open the app, add a photo, a description, the place and time for
   pick-up and soon your tasty leftovers find someone who values them!

   Are we all getting started? Uppsala is ready for the challenge to stop
   the food waste, right?!

   she ended up with some food leftovers she couldn’t finish or fit in her
   luggage. She refused to throw it away so she was looking for the woman
   who usually begs in front of the grocery store. But as fate has it, she
   wasn’t there. So Tessa was thinking, maybe her neighbours want some of
   her perfectly fresh yoghourts, cabbage or sweet potatoes? Standing in
   front of the door she didn’t dare to ring the bell, afraid of getting a
   “no”. But Tessa overcame her own fear and found a solution.

   With her new app OLIO you can get food directly to the people who want
   and need it! So now, not only Tessa but also you and your friends can
   benefit! You are leaving for some days and have some leftovers? Just
   open the app, add a photo, a description, the place and time for
   pick-up and soon your tasty leftovers find someone who values them!

   Are we all getting started? Uppsala is ready for the challenge to stop
   the food waste, right?!
