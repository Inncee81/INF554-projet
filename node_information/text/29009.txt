   Bridget Edwards

   We love bragging about our contributors, and today we’re excited to
   gush a little bit about Bridget. She’s one of the most fun, hilarious
   gals around, with the best curly hair of all time. We’re so glad she
   shares her baking expertise with us here! Her blog Bake at 350 is full
   of amazingly cute and fabulously creative cookies, and the great thing
   is that her cookies are not about perfection and don’t require any
   special equipment or excessive practice. The recipes she creates prove
   that you don’t need to go to extreme lengths to get great results. She
   just shares fun and inventive treats to make for family and friends.


   Here are a few of our favorite things Bridget has shared as a Food &
   Friends contributor.


   Things to Take to a Friend in Need

   Things to Take to a Friend in Need. We adore this post. Wonderful tips
   on how to help those you care about by delivering food when they’re
   going through trying times.



   Cocoa Powder 101

   Cocoa Powder 101. Bridget’s great with baking tips, like breaking down
   what type of cocoa powder to use in which baking applications.



   Hot Chocolate Pancakes

   Hot Chocolate Pancakes. In honor of the weekend, we can’t resist
   sharing a pancake recipe!


   Bridget’s own site has an endless supply of recipes for ridiculously
   cute cookies and other decadent treats. Here are few we can’t stop
   thinking about!


   Bridget Cheeseburger Cookies

   Cheeseburger Cookies. Gotta love a tiny burger cookie. Look at those
   toppings!



   Bridget Double Decker Stripey Valentine Cookies

   Double Decker Stripey Valentine Cookies. Valentine cuteness. ‘Tis the
   season!



   Bridget Pizza Cookies

   Take a Little Pizza My Heart Cookies. More Valentine cookies! This time
   with a message. Now we’re singing Janis Joplin.



   Bridget Kahlua Cheesecake Brownies

   Cheesecake Brownies, with Kahlua. Goodness! Whip some up for the Super
   Bowl!



   Bridget Ice Cream Sandwich Milkshakes

   Ice Cream Sandwich Milkshakes. Ice cream sandwich. In milkshake form.
   Hello, dream shake.



   Bridget Cowboy Boot Cookies

   And, of course, we can’t resist Cowboy Boot Cookies! How precious are
   these?


   We wanted to know more about what makes Bridget tick, so we asked her
   to share the inside scoop with us. Here are some of her deep, dark (not
   really) secrets.


What she enjoys about cooking or baking

   I love how food brings people together, whether it’s over the dinner
   table or at a party.


Her go-to dish or meal

   My mom’s lasagna, my Italian friend Ed’s spaghetti and meatballs, and
   Ree’s chicken spaghetti. In short, other people’s pasta dishes. Oh, and
   caramel brownies.


The strangest food that she secretly (or maybe openly) really enjoys

   I like canned frosting. I know I shouldn’t, and a good friend just
   recently gave me a hard time about it. What can I say? My palate is not
   sophisticated.


If she had to eat something right now, and had only 3 minutes to get it
ready, what would it be?

   A fried egg with butter, salt and pepper.


She panics when she's out of ...

   Ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate chips. I eat them straight out of the
   bag.


Her favorite kitchen tip that she wishes she'd always known.

   I wish I had always known to line cookie sheets with parchment paper.


A few more things most people don't know about her.

   Right out of college, I was a flight attendant … the highlight of which
   was serving scrambled eggs to Harry Connick Jr. I don’t leave the house
   without earrings. I even wear them to work out. I love, love, love Bill
   Murray. And my dream job is to be a backup singer. If only I could
   sing.


   Bridget’s just the cutest. We love her tons and hope you try one of her
   fun cookie or baking projects. If you need more inspiration or ideas,
   check out Bridget’s Pinterest board We want to make it all!

   TPW_5201 Hello, Cows!

   I’ve missed you.

   Have you missed me, too?



   TPW_5206 If someone had told me when I was eighteen that I would one
   day miss cows, I would have uttered the following phrase:

“Say wha?”

   Then I would have scratched my head, looked at them with confusion, and
   run away.

   Oh, how life changes.



   TPW_5207 Wait, cows. Where are you going? Did you not miss me, too?

   It appears that when it comes to human-bovine separation, “Absence
   makes the heart grow fonder” does not go both ways.

   Oh, and they’re not cows, Ree.

   They’re steers.

   I just love it when I get to correct myself.



   TPW_5212 Hello, road! Oh, how I’ve missed you, too.



   TPW_5217 Hello, cattle guard that leads to our homestead! Thank you for
   welcoming me with open arms.

   I mean an open gate.



   TPW_5219 Hello, homestead!

   I can’t wait to hug you and kiss you and squeeze you.

   And call you George.

       Everything is so green! Welcome home, Ree. Nothing wrong with
       missing your bovines.

       You were homesick and cows (sorry, steers) are part of your home. I
       don’t find it strange at all.
       Thank you for introducing many of us to the beauty that is the
       American southwest. It really is inspirational.

       It is always great to get home, isn’t it? I love the green grass.
       It’s so comforting to me. Makes me want to get back home, too! (I’m
       at work, ha!)

       Such a beautiful sight to come home to! 🙂

       I have a younger cousin who, when he was really little, thought his
       grandparent’s dogs (some tiny little black and white things) were
       cows. Every time he’d say “look! coooooowwwwwwws!”
       He also used to insert the word doggy into random sentences. Some
       kids stutter, he mentioned a dog. “I doggy oggy want to go doggy
       doggy oggy to the store!”
       Cutest kid ever. I’d laugh til I cried.
     * Pat in Oak Ridge TN
       I, for one, am glad you’re home. I have missed your regular posts.
     * Jeannine
       I would love to be greeted by all those pairs of big brown
       eyes!!!!! I just had a flash of steer envy 🙂

   Giant Retro Space Hopper

   Last week I went back and looked over all of my homeschooling post
   contributions here at The Pioneer Woman’s Homeschooling Blog.

   Out of all 61 posts, I realized I have yet to write any RECESS posts.

   WHAT IN THE STINKIN’ HECK?

   Let me assure you–RECESS is very important for so many reasons:

   My kids’ brains.
   My kids’ bodies.
   My kids’ ability to not destroy each other.

   Emelie rocks the Ninja shirt.

   And most important?
   MY PERSONAL SANITY.

   Wild Creations, the same website I ordered my vertically-challenged
   frogs from, has a new line of active toys from the UK Science Museum.

   A full 80 cm when fully inflated.

   I have a few things I’m testing out (and will post about later), but my
   VERY FAVORITE is the Giant Retro Space Hopper.

   Crash and Burn!

   First, it’s orange. I love orange.
   Next, it is a pretty intense muscular workout for my kids.
   Finally, it exercises my stomach muscles.

   Seriously, how can you not laugh?

   Yep, I laugh so hard while they are bouncing around, catapulting
   head-first into the grass and each other, I’ll probably have a 6-pack
   before Christmas.

   The Giant Retro Space Hopper before inflating.

   The Space Hopper does require inflation. It comes with a foot pump and
   nozzle. Once inflated to its full 80 cm in diameter, the pump nozzle is
   removed from the valve and the valve plugs closed with a stopper.

   Meredith pulls out the stopper.

   Initially, Meredith pulled out the stopper so Jeff could inflate the
   Space Hopper.

   Jeff blows it up with the air compressor.

   Of course, I must admit that Jeff did not even unwrap the pump; the man
   takes every opportunity possible to use his air compressor.

   What is it with men and their toys?

   Meredith listens for the seal.

   Once the Space Hoppers were fully inflated, Meredith re-inserted the
   stopper, firmly pushing it down to seal the valve.

   Then, she listened closely for any sounds of escaping air.

   Bouncing Away

   With all systems “GO!” the kids took the Hopper by the horns and
   “WENT!”

   Emelie and Kenny race.

   The Giant Retro Space Hopper works a lot like a spherical trampoline.
   The air inside the Hopper can’t be compressed by the weight of the
   rider, but the rubber skin bends and flexes. The impact of the rider’s
   weight compresses the Hopper and that tension in the rubber skin snaps
   it right back into shape.

   Kenny and Meredith Race

   You can feel it rebound against you.
   This is also why you need to hold on tight!

   If you want to get all SCIENTIFIC about it, which the UK Science Museum
   is apt to do, the Space Hopper works off the scientific principle of
   Newton’s third law of motion.

   For every action there is an equal reaction in the opposite direction.

   I gotta tell you–this is particularly amusing when the “equal reaction”
   jolts one kid up much higher and farther than expected.

   Giant Retro Space Hopper - Mosaic

   The Space Hopper continues to rock our recess. The kids even weave it
   into their indoor play on rainy days–thank the Lord for an open floor
   plan and home insurance.

Here Are My Experience-Based Hopper Hints

   1. If you have multiple children, be smart–get multiple Hoppers.
   Experience necessitates I share this valuable bit of information. I
   assure you, it is waaaay more fun to watch them fling into each other
   than to listen to them repeat, “It’s MYYYYYYYY turn!” 60 kajillion
   times. Take my word for this.

   2. HAVE THE VIDEO CAMERA AT THE READY!

   I took to pull together this clip!

       I’m getting my kids the Giant Hopper so that they stop bouncing on
       my inflatable exercise balls and popping them!
     * lauren in arkansas
       I had one of those when I was a kid …. it was called a Hoppity Hop
       way back then and didn’t have any faces or printing on it It was
       just red. And I got it for Christmas when I was 8 or 9. When the
       snow melted, i took it onto the street to hop over to my aunt’s
       house a block away, and it got a hole in it, most likely from a
       rock (duh …). Needless to day my mother was NOT happy with me.
     * Theresa in Alberta
       40 years ago, my little friend down the street had one of those ”
       bouncy balls”, and we played for hours with it. Now at almost age
       50 I have an excersize ball, (tyedyed blue tones if you please)
       that I sit on at the computer. Has it EVER helped my middle back,
       and legs. It is the best money I have spent and it is strengthening
       my “core muscles”. I think I gave my arm muscles a work out just
       pumping it up with air. No air compressors here 😉
     * http://www.susanbowers.typepad.com Susan
       Silly question – but do you think there is a height limit (up) on
       being able to use these things. My 13 year olds would probably love
       these but one is 5’9″ and one 5’8″.
       And I know about the air compressor comment – and men. My hubby
       will air compress the heck out of himself after I’ve given him a
       haircut just to get all the hair off him – before he takes a
       shower.

       I find it amusing that you’ve written 60+ posts about
       homeschooling, and this year one of the very first homeschooling
       posts I ever wrote was about recess, and actually had “recess” in
       the title. 😉
     * http://www.GoddessOfJewelry.etsy.com AGinTO
       I wanted one of those so badly when I was a kid, but my parents
       couldn’t afford it. So I played with the ones at school, the ones
       my friends had, the ones the kids in the neighborhood had… and the
       other day I found one in the toy store when I went in with my son.
       He had ZERO interest – he went straight to the blocks and train
       set.
       I, on the other hand, bounced around the store on it.
       Have I got no shame?
       No…I don’t! :o)

       I wonder what my husband would think if I brought one of those home
       for myself? 🙂
     * http://bethanyactually.com bethany actually
       Doh! I meant, “…you’ve written 60+ posts about homeschooling
       without mentioning recess, and this year…”
     * http://mamarazzipages.wordpress.com Christy aka Mamarazzi
       This looks like so much fun! I do remember these when we were kids,
       So glad they brought them back.
     * http://randombitsofhoney.blogspot.com/ Jenn Marie
       Thanks for the heads-up. The weight limit is 242 lbs, so
       kids-at-heart of all ages can play. I intend to challenge my hubby
       to a race. And when our friends’ children come to visit, I guess
       we’ll let them borrow them. 🙂
     * Brenda
       Oh, MY stinkin’ heck. I want one!!
     * http://www.ohmystinkinheck.com OMSH
       Susan, I saw some of their “commercials” on YouTube and there were
       grown adults on them, so I would bet they could sustain your kids.
       I’d write and ask them.
     * Marian
       Those look super. We have a teensy city yard and small house,
       though… Rats. Looks like lots of space is essential.
     * http://www.ohmystinkinheck.com OMSH
       I KNOW, RIGHT? We have always “recessed”, but I guess I’ve just not
       written about it as an official homeschool blog post.
     * http://www.mythmaticalbattles.com Laugh it Off
       Okay I had a Hoppity Horse (as it was called) in the 1970s as a
       kid. When I was three I hoppity hopped into a corner on the wall
       and required stiches in my forehead. When I was 6 I decided it
       should “buck” like a wild Hoppity Horse and threw myself backward
       onto the driveway. This knocked me out cold.
       My dad took a knife and punctured it after that. I would NOT
       recommend this toy if your child is accident prone like me.

       Had one 40+ years ago – LOVED IT. DD had one maybe 10 years ago –
       she was not as entranced as I was with it, so I took it. Just as
       much fun then as it was when I was little.

       yikes, my 42 year old sister has a facial scar from bouncing head
       first into a table on one of these when she was a child.

       This looks like lots of fun!

       I want like, elventy billion of these!!!
     * http://iloveagoodyarn.blogspot.com good yarns
       I had one when I was a kid about 40 years ago and so my kids each
       got one when they were young (several years ago). We love them! And
       the best part? Adult attempts! I will always love the photo of my
       hubby and our brother-in-law racing down the grass while the
       pee-wee kids looked on and cheered!
     * Shelly
       Oh my! Yes, recess is an important part of our homeschool day too!
       My kids had one of those bouncy balls when they were younger and
       they had so much fun with it; but it’s true, multiple balls for
       multiple kids makes the world a more pleasant place. 🙂
       Another fun thing my kids like to do (and isn’t as dangerous for
       those accident prone kids like my oldest boy who has many, many
       scars on his noggin… boys…) are hula-hoops! Hula-hoops are great
       fun! But my kids would go hog wild over another bouncy ball, they
       still talk about the red bouncy ball they had, and that had to be
       10 years ago when it finally popped.
     * Ginger
       Oh yes! We have two bouncy balls for my three kids — I totally hear
       ya’ on the “My turn!” chant!
       I should mention that I got mine at TJ Maxx and ToysRUs, and
       they’re smaller, but you can find a range of sizes if you look
       around, for different ages.
       My youngest (just turned 4) would do her best when she was tiny to
       climb on and hang on, without much success, but is now good at it.
       My oldest (just turned 9, but almost 5 feet tall) can still use
       them too — he just looks more like a stork than his sisters. I’ve
       even played with them, and I didn’t manage to pop one, so I think
       most kids are pretty safe. 😉
     * PaulaMc
       That is a super cool hopper. It looks a good deal like the one
       Gromit uses in the Wallace and Gromit film “The Curse of the
       Were-Rabbit.” Fun times!!!
     * http://cowpattysurprise.blogspot.com Nezzy (Cow Patty Surprise)
       Woohoo, this Ozark Farm Chick want’s one. Heck, I’ll take nine, one
       for each of the grandkiddo plus me. Yep, ya can always find me
       right there out in the middle of ’em…I’m just that kinda of
       Grandma. Ya know…a little like Peter Pan…”I’ll never grow up…….
       I love it!!! :o) :o) :o)
       From the fabulously fun hills and hollers of the Missouri
       Ponderosa, ya’ll have a most wonderfully blessed day now, ya
       hear!!!!

   WINNER: First of all…because travel delays caused me to announce this
   late, I have drawn four random names and am awarding each person a $100
   Amazon.com gift card. Thanks again for being patient!

   The winner of the NIKON camera is…

   #12852 FELICIA: “Well, I’m a 1 most of the time…my friends & family
   call me a “grinch”. I would LOVE to get away from it all with just my
   immediate family so I could truly “enjoy” just spending time with them
   – rather than having to rush around to a million different places & not
   feel like I’ve had any time to enjoy anything.”

   Aww, Felicia. I hope this gives you just a tiny bit of a boost in your
   enjoyment of the holidays this year. Congrats on winning the camera!
   Contact prizes@thepioneerwoman.com to claim your prize.

   The following four players win a $100 Amazon.com gift card:

   #34063 Teejay: “Getting used to celbrating holidays after the loss of a
   loved one is, well, let’s just say difficult. Easy to feel lonely,
   depressed, sad, guilty, anxious, but conversly also happy,
   appreciative, hopeful, relaxed, thankful.”

   #31705 Elizabeth Hansen: “This year, it is a 9. How incredibly lucky
   and blessed I am to say that! I will be celebrating the holidays with
   my beautiful (and very photogenic!) 6 month old daughter, a loving
   husband, and a supportive family. To top it off, a home, heat, hot
   water, and food on the table. I am even thankful to have my job… even
   on those days when I would much rather stay at home with my little one.
   I would make it a perfect 10, except that I recognize that many others
   aren’t so fortunate. Hoping that this holiday season brings the spirit
   of giving and help to those in need so that we can all have a little
   holiday cheer!”

   #176 Jeff H: “10. I love everything about the Christmas season. I love
   the sacred. I love the tacky. I love the church candlelight service on
   Christmas Eve. I love giving presents to my little girls. I love the
   quiet time after Christmas where I take a little time to reflect on the
   year before jumping back into the fray after New Year’s.”

   #18616 Renee: “An absolute 10! Love Christmas and everything that goes
   with it!”

   ________________________________

   Today…

   Because I’m in New York with my girls…

   Because I’m taking photos of all the window displays…

   Because I’m taking photos of falafel…

   Because I’m weird…

   And because I love ya…


   I’m giving away a Nikon D90 DSLR camera.


   Yahoo yippety.


   Here are the details:


   Nikon D90 SLR Digital Camera with a Nikon 18-105mm VR Lens. It’s a
   great, solid camera that’ll make your skirt fly up…unless you’re a boy.
   But boy or girl, this is a camera—and a great lens—that’ll make you
   happy.


   Here’s the back view:



   To enter the giveaway, just answer the following question in the
   Comments section of this post:


   “On a scale of one to ten, how much do you love the holiday season?”

   Are you a huge ten? Or are you more of a five with mixed feelings? Do
   you start getting ready for Christmas on September 1? Or do you sort of
   hold on and brace yourself till the madness passes? Do you love the
   tradition, family togetherness, and meaning of the holidays? Or do you
   feel swept away? Just list your current love for the Christmas and
   you’re automatically entered to win the camera.


   THE RULES


   One entry per person, please. Strictly enforced with a paddle.


   No entries after 12:00 noon Pacific Time Friday.


   Winner will be selected at random and announced Saturday.


   Good luck!

Types of Popcorn

   Erica showed us how to make perfect stovetop popcorn. Natalie shared
   ways to elevate popcorn. (That chocolate version has my name written
   all over it.) But have you ever wondered about the types and varieties
   of popping corn?

   When we were growing up, my dad popped popcorn almost every night. He
   still does. Some nights he eats it for dessert, some nights it’s for
   dinner. He always popped it on the stove (no microwave popcorn
   allowed), and it was always standard yellow popcorn.



   Over the years, I know I’ve given him sets of colored popcorns and
   gourmet popcorns, but he always goes back to his yellow. I decided I
   need to check out these varieties for myself.



   First things first: once you pop the corn, pour some butter over it,
   and sprinkle with salt, it all tastes pretty similar. Most of the
   differences come in size and shape. Except for the mushroom type, all
   of the other types here are called “butterfly” or “snowflake” because
   of their shape once popped.



From left to right: ladyfinger, white, yellow, and mushroom kernels.


   Some popcorns are labeled as “hulless.” This is a bit of a misnomer, as
   the hull is the outer layer of the kernel—all popping corn has a hull.
   Varieties known as hulless are generally smaller with a thinner shell.



YELLOW

   Yellow is the popcorn you’ll find at your local grocery store. It’s
   large, yellow in color, and exactly what you think of when you think
   “popcorn.” Yellow popcorn, even the organic varieties, is inexpensive.
   We always have some on hand. This is also what movie theaters use.



WHITE

   Similar in size to yellow, white popcorn pops up, you guessed it,
   white. The pieces are slightly more tender than yellow popcorn.



   Here’s a comparison of the two. Both of these varieties are just the
   ticket for traditional buttery or cheesy popcorn.



MUSHROOM

   Mushroom popcorn is big, billowy, and fluffy. It’s ideal for candy
   coating or drizzling with chocolate. I’ve eaten mushroom popcorn
   before, but this was my first time popping it at home. When I lifted
   the lid, my heart did a little pitter-patter: it’s so fluffy! (Please
   read that in the voice of Agnes from Despicable Me.)



LADYFINGER

   This yellow popcorn is dainty. If you love the tiny pieces of popcorn
   at the bottom of the bowl, you’ll love ladyfinger. The small size makes
   this type good for topping soups or baked goods.



From left to right: mushroom, yellow, and ladyfinger popcorn.

   Here they are side by side so you have an idea of their respective
   sizes.



   Have you ever seen colored popcorn? Red, blue, and purple are the
   common varieties.



RED

   Red pops up white! A little smaller than the traditional yellow and
   white popcorn, red also has a very neutral taste and more crunch.



BLUE

   Blue is very similar to red. Pops white with a big crunch and slightly
   smaller size.



PURPLE

   Of the colored popcorns, purple has the most flavor.



   Once popped, it’s a pale yellow with small purple spots. The kernels
   are a little larger than the blue or red types.



   Now that we’ve tested all seven, our family favorites are yellow,
   white, mushroom, and purple. The difficult task will be deciding what
   to pop for our next movie night!



Bridget

   Bridget Edwards likes cookies. She’s been decorating them for over a
   decade and eating them for as long as she can remember. The author of
   two cookie books, Decorating Cookies and Decorating Cookies Party,
   Bridget believes: 1.) Cookies are made to be eaten, not to be perfect.
   2.) Making pretty shouldn’t require an art degree or a fancy overhead
   projector. 3.) Your time is better spent EATING cookies with family and
   friends than slaving over decorating them. Bridget shares cookies and
   recipes for all things sweet on her blog, Bake at 350. She resides in
   the Lone Star State with her husband, teenage son, and two kitties.
