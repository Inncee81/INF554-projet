Book Review: A Leader's Guide to Cybersecurity
       A Leader's Guide to Cybersecurity educates readers about how to
       prevent a crisis and/or take leadership when one occurs. With a
       focus on clear communication, the book provides details, examples,
       and guidance of mapping security against what a business actually
       does. The book describes ways to align security with the motivation
       of others who may be security-agnostic against their own goals.

Bryan Liles on Making Kubernetes Easier for Developers, the CNCF, and
“Serverless”
       In this podcast, Daniel Bryant sat down with Bryan Liles, senior
       staff engineer at VMware. Topics covered included: the challenges
       with deploying applications into Kubernetes, using the open source
       Octant tool to increase a user’s understanding of Kubernetes
       clusters, and how “serverless” technologies may influence the
       future approaches to building software.

13 Practices for Better Code Reviews
       When done incorrectly, code review can be irritating, excessively
       time consuming, and have little or no impact on code quality.
       However, if done well, it can improve the quality of code and
       reduce the overall time spent delivering features. This article
       provides several good practices regarding both technical and
       cultural aspects of code review.

The Unicorn Project and the Five Ideals: Interview with Gene Kim
       The Unicorn Project is a fictionalized story about a DevOps
       transformation. Gene Kim introduces the five ideals of Locality and
       Simplicity; Focus, Flow and Joy; Improvement of Daily Work;
       Psychological Safety; and Customer Focus. The book confirms the
       importance of the DevOps movement as a better way of working and
       addresses the importance of architecture and developers’
       productivity.
