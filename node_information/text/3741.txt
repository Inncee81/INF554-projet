   Are the negative reviews getting through?
   AIRBNB ADVISED

Airbnb guests accuse it of deleting negative reviews and boosting bad hosts

   By Alison GriswoldAugust 5, 2018

   The two-bedroom condo that Donna Oakley arrived to in Winston-Salem,
   North Carolina, in late June didn’t look much like the five-star
   property she’d booked on Airbnb.

   The windows in the living room were streaked and milky, hardly the
   clean, sunny room that was advertised. One window had a large cobweb in
   the corner and dead bugs inside the sill. There was mold in the kitchen
   cabinets and around the floorboards, the oven door was coated in
   grease, and the vents were caked with dirt. In the bathroom, the toilet
   bowl had dark orange stains and the sink faucet handle was broken.

   “That place was nasty,” Oakley, 59, said.

   Oakley, who is retired and lives in Fort Myers, Florida, had booked the
   condo a few months earlier for a four-week visit to family in
   Winston-Salem. She had stayed in Airbnbs many times—using the
   home-rental company to travel to London, Rome, Paris, Naples, Venice,
   and Puerto Rico, among other destinations—and always had good
   experiences. (Oakley is the mother of a former Quartz employee.)

   After three nights in the Winston-Salem condo, Oakley and her husband
   found a new place to stay. They had also had issues with the neighbors,
   who parked their car in the Airbnb’s designated spot, and who Oakley
   said threatened her after she asked them to move their vehicle. Oakley
   contacted Airbnb, which refunded her the remaining four days in the the
   first week, the only portion of the 28-day booking she had paid for at
   that point. Then she wrote a review.

   “We felt it was necessary to move our car somewhere else… and this was
   not a safe environment due to the threat of violence,” she wrote in a
   review that detailed the confrontation with the condo’s neighbors. “The
   condo is in need of a significant cleaning. It appears to have been
   neglected.”

   Airbnb hosts and guests have 14 days after checkout to write a review,
   and the company doesn’t post them online until both parties have
   completed their evaluations, or the 14 days have expired. Oakley
   submitted two paragraphs totaling 311 words. The review that eventually
   appeared under her name was just one sentence: “Please be aware that
   this property is unclean and the neighbors are rude and threatened
   violence in reference to a parking space (which is extremely limited).”
   Airbnb’s ratings system is only as good as its reviews.

   Airbnb built a $31 billion travel and lodging company by convincing
   millions of travelers that staying in a stranger’s apartment was as
   good or better than booking a room in a hotel. The company’s five-star
   review system, which lets guests review hosts and properties and hosts
   review their guests, is one of its most important tools in fostering
   the trust needed to make a home-sharing community work.

   “You have to remember that before Airbnb existed, this was a really,
   really rare transaction in the economy—and now it’s become really
   common,” said Andrey Fradkin, an assistant professor at Boston
   University Questrom School of Business and former data scientist at
   Airbnb. “The introduction of the reputation system is part of the key
   reasons for why this marketplace has been able to succeed.”

   Of course, the system is only as good as its reviews, and Oakley and
   four other Airbnb users who spoke to Quartz allege that Airbnb tampered
   with theirs. These Airbnb guests say the negative reviews they
   submitted to the company after a bad experience were either edited or
   quietly removed from the site without their knowledge or permission.

   In an emailed statement, Airbnb spokesperson Nick Papas said authentic
   reviews are “critical to building trust” between the company’s hosts
   and guests. He pointed to Airbnb’s content policy, which outlines why a
   review might be taken down, such as for illegal, profane, or
   discriminatory material. “The goal of this policy is to ensure that any
   fraudulent or misleading content is not allowed on the site,” he said.
   “Just as critical, this policy also exists to protect the integrity of
   authentic feedback from our community.”

   Leslie McCree, 51, used Airbnb for the first time in early June to
   vacation with her husband and daughter in Sunnyvale, California.
   McCree, who works as a public health advisor in Atlanta, Georgia, was
   initially concerned that the unit didn’t have any air conditioning,
   according to its listing. But, she said, the condo had exclusively
   five-star reviews and the host assured her in a direct message that it
   didn’t get that hot in the Bay Area.

   “It was very hot,” McCree said, “and there was one little table-top
   fan.” She also discovered hair in the bathtub, dust and debris in the
   pullout sofa, soiled linens, dirty skillets, and dead bugs in the
   cabinets. The upstairs neighbors were loud. And because the unit was on
   the first floor, she felt uncomfortable leaving the windows open at
   night.
   Airbnb wouldn’t be the first internet company to run into trouble with
   online reviews.

   In her review, a copy of which McCree messaged to the Airbnb host and
   also shared with Quartz, she described the condo as “hot as heck” and
   noted its dirtiness and the loud upstairs neighbors. When the review
   didn’t appear after several days, she contacted Airbnb through its
   in-app support, which explained the 14-day policy.

   When McCree still couldn’t locate her review after 14 days, she
   contacted Airbnb again. “The review you posted has now been re posted,”
   a support rep responded later that day. She checked that the review had
   posted like Airbnb said, and it had. But when McCree searched for her
   review again in July after being contacted by Quartz for this story, it
   was gone. She wrote to support again on July 19, noting that she had
   “been contacted by the media regarding this issue.” On July 21, another
   Airbnb support rep, who identified himself as a supervisor, told McCree
   her review had been re-posted.

   McCree said she doesn’t plan to use Airbnb again. “I think the reviews
   are all hyped up to entice the person to book the property and in turn
   make money for Airbnb,” she said.

   Airbnb wouldn’t be the first internet company to run into trouble with
   online reviews. Travel website TripAdvisor in 2017 apologized after it
   was caught repeatedly deleting a review of a Mexican resort by a woman
   who said she was raped there by a security guard. Also in 2017, a
   writer for Vice in the UK duped TripAdvisor into making his shed
   London’s top-rated restaurant.

   Ride-hailing company Uber, which asks riders to rate their driver at
   the end of each trip, has struggled with ratings inflation. Riders are
   generally reluctant to leave less than a perfect five-star rating,
   which is widely understood to hurt the driver.
   “The reputation system is a primary means… to prevent bad actors from
   misrepresenting their listings.”

   An April 2018 paper (pdf) by Fradkin and two others on the
   effectiveness of Airbnb reviews noted that “negative experiences are
   underreported.” Their paper used 2014 data, before Airbnb required
   hosts and guests to submit reviews or wait 14 days before they post,
   and theorized that guests were withholding negative feedback in part
   because they feared retaliation. They found that when a “simultaneous
   reveal” was introduced, there was a modest decline in five-star ratings
   of hosts and a similar uptick in overall review rates.

   “The reputation system is a primary means by which you’re going to
   prevent bad actors from misrepresenting their listings and delivering
   bad service,” Fradkin told Quartz.

   Several of the Airbnb guests who spoke with Quartz said they decided to
   leave negative reviews as a warning to future travelers. “I don’t want
   other people to go through this experience,” said Mostafa El-Hoshy, 33.
   He rented an Airbnb in Manhattan around Thanksgiving last year for
   himself and his parents that turned out to have rusty faucets, dirty
   floorboards, and a trash-filled dumpster blocking the entrance. The
   featured photo on the listing was an aerial view of Union Square Park,
   though the caption noted it was “not a view from the window.”

   El-Hoshy wrote to Airbnb on his first night in the apartment about what
   he felt was a deceptive listing, including photos of the unit. The
   company told him it had given the host until noon the following day to
   “get those issues resolved,” according to messages he shared with
   Quartz. El-Hoshy asked Airbnb to cancel the reservation.
   Mostafa El-Hoshy
   What was advertised at the Airbnb Mostafa El-Hoshy booked vs. the
   unit’s actual entrance.

   Airbnb later told El-Hoshy that the host “did meet the deadline to get
   those items fixed” and that he didn’t qualify for a full refund because
   “the host was working with us to accommodate the issues.” “I do see
   where his listing can be misleading,” a support rep who identified
   herself as “Beth” wrote, “but in the description visible, it states
   that the view of the park isn’t from the window, but within walking
   distance away by being 1 block away.”

   El-Hoshy eventually contacted Chase, the credit-card provider he’d used
   to book the Airbnb, which cancelled the transaction. He wrote a
   negative review of the property and said it never posted. “You just
   turned a huge Airbnb fan into a huge Airbnb detractor,” El-Hoshy wrote
   in one of his last messages to Airbnb support.

   Airbnb, after being contacted by Quartz, said both McCree’s and
   El-Hoshy’s reviews “were removed in error,” but did not elaborate on
   why. “We are working to ensure these review go back online, and
   reaching out to these guests to apologize and fully refund them for the
   cost of their stay,” Papas, Airbnb’s spokesman, said in an email. Both
   McCree and El-Hoshy confirmed to Quartz that their reviews had been
   posted.

   After Donna Oakley noticed that her two-paragraph Airbnb review of the
   Winston-Salem condo had been rewritten as a single sentence, she
   contacted support again to ask why it had been changed. “This was a
   nightmare situation and I don’t want anyone else to ever be duped into
   renting,” Oakley wrote to support, according to screenshots of messages
   she shared with Quartz. “This property is a poor reflection of Airbnb
   and I’m sure if it had been my first it would have been my last.”

   When Airbnb replied, it didn’t explain why Oakley’s review had been
   condensed and modified, but noted that its reviews are limited to 500
   words (Oakley submitted just over 300). “At this point we are unable to
   help you complete the review as you desire,” the support rep said.
   “Thank you for your understanding on this matter.” Oakley said all her
   messages with Airbnb about the Winston-Salem condo have since
   disappeared from her Airbnb account, as has any record of her booking
   the property.

   Airbnb, after being told about the incident by Quartz, initially
   suggested that “the guest might have left comments in a section that
   isn’t public” and said it couldn’t “find any record of the review being
   changed.” (Oakley said she’s sure she posted her comments in the
   correct place.) The company said, as a general policy, it doesn’t edit
   reviews.

   Oakley used to encourage all her friends to use Airbnb, but after the
   Winston-Salem experience she doesn’t plan to proselytize it anymore. “I
   have always been like, you’ve got to try it, let me show you what to
   do,” she said. “And now I’m like, the reviews are not even true.”

Here are the top 10 cryptoassets of 2017 (and bitcoin’s 1,000% rise doesn’t
even make the list)

   By Joon Ian WongJanuary 1, 2018

   Bitcoin’s value grew by more than 1,000% in 2017, but that wasn’t
   enough to even place it among the 10 best-performing cryptoassets of
   the year.

   In a breakout year for cryptocurrency trading, the biggest winners were
   Ripple, which is touted as a new kind of payment system for banks,
   along with less familiar names like NEM, Ardor, and Dash. Here are the
   top 10 cryptoassets of 2017—plus bitcoin, which came in 14th place:
   Chart from TheAtlas.com

   Cryptoassets include standalone cryptocurrencies as well as tokens
   issued on the ethereum blockchain. Our ranking is based on a comparison
   of the yearlong gains made by the 10 most valuable cryptoassets as of
   Jan. 1, 2018, as measured by data provider CoinMarketcap.

   Ripple’s big gains—it rose an astonishing 36,000%—came largely at the
   tail end of the year. Here’s how its 2017 looked compared to bitcoin:
   Chart from TheAtlas.com

   Bitcoin fares slightly better when compared against rival
   cryptocurrencies, meaning tokens with their own blockchains. This
   excludes tokens issued through so-called initial coin offerings (ICOs),
   which were a craze last year. Bitcoin makes it to eighth place in this
   ranking, although it’s still trounced by ethereum and litecoin:
   Chart from TheAtlas.com

   The ICO craze attracted over $3.7 billion in funds this year, according
   to data provider Coin Schedule. Many of these projects only launched
   months ago. Yet big names like Golem and OmiseGo lagged behind lesser
   known ones like Ardor in the performance charts.
   Chart from TheAtlas.com

   Bitcoin’s performance may seem lackluster compared to its newer,
   shinier, brethren, but it’s worth putting its gains in context. After
   all, the Nasdaq Composite Index gained 27% last year.

   It’s difficult to imagine cryptoassets delivering another year of crazy
   gains in 2018. Traders who are thinking of cashing out may benefit from
   this Quartz guide to paying your taxes on those cryptoasset profits.

   No two composts are alike.
   Sponsor Content By BASF

These maps show how the world composts

   By gbaconqzJune 3, 2014

   Composting is far from underground now. The practice has blossomed into
   a movement. In much of the world, compost has even spread from the
   backyard to the curb. Yet its role in our sustainability imperative can
   grow much more.

   Eco-friendly communities around the world are making composting part of
   their efforts. From Serenbe, Georgia to Earthsong, New Zealand, people
   are living with the environment in mind to various degrees–practicing
   green construction, organic and well-managed gardening, recycling,
   reliance on renewable power, and sharing of housing amenities.

   Recovering waste from food is key to sustainability, as the latest EPA
   statistics from 2012 show (fact sheet PDF here). Americans generated
   36.43 million tons of food waste and sent 34.69 million tons of that to
   landfills, meaning that only 1.74 million tons, or 4.8% of the total
   waste, were recovered or recycled.

   Increased composting is becoming a clear alternative to the range of
   costs associated with landfill waste. Even New York City, where density
   and infrastructure have been obstacles in the past, began a pilot
   composting program last summer that is on track to become mandatory and
   citywide.

   The west coast provides substantial inspiration. Cities like San
   Francisco have had large programs in place for years. A new effort in
   Portland reportedly cut curbside trash by 44 percent. In general,
   recent data mapped out here situates the western U.S. at the national
   forefront, though Canada’s results are even more impressive.

   Europe has also shown a strong commitment to the practice. While data
   for the rest of the world is scarce, communities from India to
   Australia are adopting compost as a key part of sustainability efforts.

   The rise in composting is based in its straightforward benefits.
   Allowing organic matter to break down naturally and putting it to use
   in gardens does wonders for the quality of soil and plants. Composting
   is also a small burden on the patient composter, as time and nature do
   most of the work.

   Composting more current waste would dramatically reduce what ends up in
   landfills, but so can making more waste compostable in the first place.
   BASF’s ecovio is a bioplastic that is made of biobased content and is
   certified compostable. It can replace the materials in noncompostable
   plastic bags, shrink wraps, foam packaging and coatings on paper
   products without sacrificing the strength and performance of
   conventional plastics.

   BASF has used ecovio in successful sustainability projects around the
   world, but this important amplifier of composting’s impact is still
   developing. Bioplastics expand the composting map. Before we overwork
   the earth, we must work better with it.

   This article was produced on behalf of BASF by the Quartz Marketing
   team and not by the Quartz editorial staff.

   Expanding AI for surveillance
   SOMEBODY'S WATCHING YOU

Chinese firms are driving the rise of AI surveillance across Africa

   By Abdi Latif DahirSeptember 18, 2019

   Artificial intelligence technology is proliferating fast across the
   world and is being deployed in applications from speech recognition to
   deepfake videos and monitoring traffic congestion. It’s also
   increasingly being used to monitor and track citizens, according to a
   new report.

   At least 75 out of 176 nations surveyed globally are actively using AI
   technologies for surveillance purposes, according to the Carnegie
   Endowment for International Peace. These include facial recognition
   systems, smart policing tools, and the establishment of safe city
   platforms. The leading vendors of these systems globally are Chinese
   firms, led by Huawei, which has supplied these technologies to at least
   50 states worldwide.

   The study’s author, Steven Feldstein, wrote these tools were being used
   to “accomplish a range of policy objectives—some lawful, others that
   violate human rights, and many of which fall into a murky middle
   ground.”

   African countries are still struggling to adopt AI technologies, with
   the report noting that less than one-quarter of countries investing in
   these systems. That’s partly explained by the fact the continent is
   still struggling with internet connectivity.

   Yet Chinese companies are quickly penetrating African markets, offering
   soft loans for governments to purchase their equipment and promising to
   set up and manage these systems. In Kenya, for instance, Huawei has
   helped install video systems that deployed 1,800 HD cameras and 200 HD
   traffic surveillance systems across Nairobi. In Zimbabwe, the
   Guangzhou-based developer CloudWalk announced a controversial deal in
   2018 to oversee a large-scale facial recognition program in
   collaboration with authorities.

   Most of these arrangements have come under scrutiny especially in light
   of how China harnesses technology for social control—particularly among
   ethnic Uyghur Muslims in its restive northwestern Xinjiang region.
   Chart from TheAtlas.com


   The debate over AI technologies also comes as African governments and
   activists clash over issues including digital privacy, information
   censorship, surveillance, and internet shutdowns. With the dearth of
   privacy laws in nations like Kenya, there’s concern about how
   governments will use these repositories of data, where they will be
   stored, and who will have access to them.

   By following China’s lead, there’s also unease that information and
   communications technologies could be used to intimidate and coerce
   critics of the state. Last year, the US-based think tank Freedom House
   claimed Beijing was training African states on some of its own
   restrictive online measures.

   As its operations proliferate, Huawei’s involvement in Africa has come
   under scrutiny in recent years. In 2018, the company denied allegations
   the tech infrastructure it installed at the African Union was used by
   China to spy on the continental body. A recent investigation by the
   Wall Street Journal also showed Huawei technicians allegedly helped
   cybersecurity forces in Uganda and Zambia intercept the communications
   and track down opponents. Uganda’s cash-strapped police also bought
   closed-circuit television cameras for $126 million from Huawei—a move
   opposition figures worry could be used to identify and target
   demonstrators and opposition figures ahead of the 2021 polls.

   Despite these allegations, African states have remained loyal to both
   China and Huawei, collaborating on rolling out 5G networks and boosting
   sectors like cloud computing and artificial intelligence.

   China, however, is not the only country using or supplying advanced
   surveillance tech worldwide. Democracies such as the United States and
   France have deployed them for surveillance too, while companies in
   Japan and Germany are helping spread them worldwide.

   (BUM BAGS, ACTUALLY)

Fanny packs are generating nearly a quarter of the US accessories industry’s
growth

   By Natasha FrostDecember 8, 2018

   You may know it as a bum bag, a travel pouch, a belly bag, a belt bag,
   or even a butt pack. But whatever you call it, the fanny pack is having
   a moment.

   Back in July, Quartz fashion reporter Marc Bain noted that fanny packs
   were “in the midst of a major revival,” with iterations arriving from
   such high-powered brands as Alexander Wang, Louis Vuitton, and
   Gucci. The extent of that revival, however, may surprise you. Despite
   making up just 1% of fashion-accessories sales, fanny packs
   were responsible for nearly 25% of the industry’s growth in the first
   10 months of this year, according to market-research firm NPD Group.
   That’s quite an achievement for an accessory that’s been around
   since 3400 BCE.

   Fashion-accessory sales overall grew 4% in the same period, following
   years of decline. Other strong sellers include backpacks and suitcases.

   If you’re contemplating wading into the weird and wonderful world of
   fanny packs, there are plenty of options—not just which one you buy,
   but also how you wear it. Fanny packs can go over your behind or around
   your middle; they can be slung over the shoulder or across the
   chest. It’s a trend that looks equally good (or bad) on everyone,
   regardless of size or shape, color or creed.

   Not even gender is a barrier. “Fanny packs, or ‘waist bags’ as we now
   call them, are the fastest-growing segment in the men’s accessories
   market,” an analyst from NPD Group told the Wall Street
   Journal (paywall) last year. Fanny pack sales of $100 million between
   September 2016 and September 2017 sounded staggering at the time—but
   clearly it was just the tip of the iceberg. Buckle up.

   Are the negative reviews getting through?
   AIRBNB ADVISED

Airbnb guests accuse it of deleting negative reviews and boosting bad hosts

   By Alison GriswoldAugust 5, 2018

   The two-bedroom condo that Donna Oakley arrived to in Winston-Salem,
   North Carolina, in late June didn’t look much like the five-star
   property she’d booked on Airbnb.

   The windows in the living room were streaked and milky, hardly the
   clean, sunny room that was advertised. One window had a large cobweb in
   the corner and dead bugs inside the sill. There was mold in the kitchen
   cabinets and around the floorboards, the oven door was coated in
   grease, and the vents were caked with dirt. In the bathroom, the toilet
   bowl had dark orange stains and the sink faucet handle was broken.

   “That place was nasty,” Oakley, 59, said.
   Donna Oakley
   A streaked, dirty window and windowsill in the Winston-Salem Airbnb.

   Oakley, who is retired and lives in Fort Myers, Florida, had booked the
   condo a few months earlier for a four-week visit to family in
   Winston-Salem. She had stayed in Airbnbs many times—using the
   home-rental company to travel to London, Rome, Paris, Naples, Venice,
   and Puerto Rico, among other destinations—and always had good
   experiences. (Oakley is the mother of a former Quartz employee.)

   After three nights in the Winston-Salem condo, Oakley and her husband
   found a new place to stay. They had also had issues with the neighbors,
   who parked their car in the Airbnb’s designated spot, and who Oakley
   said threatened her after she asked them to move their vehicle. Oakley
   contacted Airbnb, which refunded her the remaining four days in the the
   first week, the only portion of the 28-day booking she had paid for at
   that point. Then she wrote a review.

   “We felt it was necessary to move our car somewhere else… and this was
   not a safe environment due to the threat of violence,” she wrote in a
   review that detailed the confrontation with the condo’s neighbors. “The
   condo is in need of a significant cleaning. It appears to have been
   neglected.”

   Airbnb hosts and guests have 14 days after checkout to write a review,
   and the company doesn’t post them online until both parties have
   completed their evaluations, or the 14 days have expired. Oakley
   submitted two paragraphs totaling 311 words. The review that eventually
   appeared under her name was just one sentence: “Please be aware that
   this property is unclean and the neighbors are rude and threatened
   violence in reference to a parking space (which is extremely limited).”
   Airbnb’s ratings system is only as good as its reviews.

   Airbnb built a $31 billion travel and lodging company by convincing
   millions of travelers that staying in a stranger’s apartment was as
   good or better than booking a room in a hotel. The company’s five-star
   review system, which lets guests review hosts and properties and hosts
   review their guests, is one of its most important tools in fostering
   the trust needed to make a home-sharing community work.

   “You have to remember that before Airbnb existed, this was a really,
   really rare transaction in the economy—and now it’s become really
   common,” said Andrey Fradkin, an assistant professor at Boston
   University Questrom School of Business and former data scientist at
   Airbnb. “The introduction of the reputation system is part of the key
   reasons for why this marketplace has been able to succeed.”

   Of course, the system is only as good as its reviews, and Oakley and
   four other Airbnb users who spoke to Quartz allege that Airbnb tampered
   with theirs. These Airbnb guests say the negative reviews they
   submitted to the company after a bad experience were either edited or
   quietly removed from the site without their knowledge or permission.

   In an emailed statement, Airbnb spokesperson Nick Papas said authentic
   reviews are “critical to building trust” between the company’s hosts
   and guests. He pointed to Airbnb’s content policy, which outlines why a
   review might be taken down, such as for illegal, profane, or
   discriminatory material. “The goal of this policy is to ensure that any
   fraudulent or misleading content is not allowed on the site,” he said.
   “Just as critical, this policy also exists to protect the integrity of
   authentic feedback from our community.”

   Leslie McCree, 51, used Airbnb for the first time in early June to
   vacation with her husband and daughter in Sunnyvale, California.
   McCree, who works as a public health advisor in Atlanta, Georgia, was
   initially concerned that the unit didn’t have any air conditioning,
   according to its listing. But, she said, the condo had exclusively
   five-star reviews and the host assured her in a direct message that it
   didn’t get that hot in the Bay Area.

   “It was very hot,” McCree said, “and there was one little table-top
   fan.” She also discovered hair in the bathtub, dust and debris in the
   pullout sofa, soiled linens, dirty skillets, and dead bugs in the
   cabinets. The upstairs neighbors were loud. And because the unit was on
   the first floor, she felt uncomfortable leaving the windows open at
   night.
   Airbnb wouldn’t be the first internet company to run into trouble with
   online reviews.

   In her review, a copy of which McCree messaged to the Airbnb host and
   also shared with Quartz, she described the condo as “hot as heck” and
   noted its dirtiness and the loud upstairs neighbors. When the review
   didn’t appear after several days, she contacted Airbnb through its
   in-app support, which explained the 14-day policy.

   When McCree still couldn’t locate her review after 14 days, she
   contacted Airbnb again. “The review you posted has now been re posted,”
   a support rep responded later that day. She checked that the review had
   posted like Airbnb said, and it had. But when McCree searched for her
   review again in July after being contacted by Quartz for this story, it
   was gone. She wrote to support again on July 19, noting that she had
   “been contacted by the media regarding this issue.” On July 21, another
   Airbnb support rep, who identified himself as a supervisor, told McCree
   her review had been re-posted.

   McCree said she doesn’t plan to use Airbnb again. “I think the reviews
   are all hyped up to entice the person to book the property and in turn
   make money for Airbnb,” she said.

   Airbnb wouldn’t be the first internet company to run into trouble with
   online reviews. Travel website TripAdvisor in 2017 apologized after it
   was caught repeatedly deleting a review of a Mexican resort by a woman
   who said she was raped there by a security guard. Also in 2017, a
   writer for Vice in the UK duped TripAdvisor into making his shed
   London’s top-rated restaurant.

   Ride-hailing company Uber, which asks riders to rate their driver at
   the end of each trip, has struggled with ratings inflation. Riders are
   generally reluctant to leave less than a perfect five-star rating,
   which is widely understood to hurt the driver.
   “The reputation system is a primary means… to prevent bad actors from
   misrepresenting their listings.”

   An April 2018 paper (pdf) by Fradkin and two others on the
   effectiveness of Airbnb reviews noted that “negative experiences are
   underreported.” Their paper used 2014 data, before Airbnb required
   hosts and guests to submit reviews or wait 14 days before they post,
   and theorized that guests were withholding negative feedback in part
   because they feared retaliation. They found that when a “simultaneous
   reveal” was introduced, there was a modest decline in five-star ratings
   of hosts and a similar uptick in overall review rates.

   “The reputation system is a primary means by which you’re going to
   prevent bad actors from misrepresenting their listings and delivering
   bad service,” Fradkin told Quartz.

   Several of the Airbnb guests who spoke with Quartz said they decided to
   leave negative reviews as a warning to future travelers. “I don’t want
   other people to go through this experience,” said Mostafa El-Hoshy, 33.
   He rented an Airbnb in Manhattan around Thanksgiving last year for
   himself and his parents that turned out to have rusty faucets, dirty
   floorboards, and a trash-filled dumpster blocking the entrance. The
   featured photo on the listing was an aerial view of Union Square Park,
   though the caption noted it was “not a view from the window.”

   El-Hoshy wrote to Airbnb on his first night in the apartment about what
   he felt was a deceptive listing, including photos of the unit. The
   company told him it had given the host until noon the following day to
   “get those issues resolved,” according to messages he shared with
   Quartz. El-Hoshy asked Airbnb to cancel the reservation.
   Mostafa El-Hoshy
   What was advertised at the Airbnb Mostafa El-Hoshy booked vs. the
   unit’s actual entrance.

   Airbnb later told El-Hoshy that the host “did meet the deadline to get
   those items fixed” and that he didn’t qualify for a full refund because
   “the host was working with us to accommodate the issues.” “I do see
   where his listing can be misleading,” a support rep who identified
   herself as “Beth” wrote, “but in the description visible, it states
   that the view of the park isn’t from the window, but within walking
   distance away by being 1 block away.”

   El-Hoshy eventually contacted Chase, the credit-card provider he’d used
   to book the Airbnb, which cancelled the transaction. He wrote a
   negative review of the property and said it never posted. “You just
   turned a huge Airbnb fan into a huge Airbnb detractor,” El-Hoshy wrote
   in one of his last messages to Airbnb support.

   Airbnb, after being contacted by Quartz, said both McCree’s and
   El-Hoshy’s reviews “were removed in error,” but did not elaborate on
   why. “We are working to ensure these review go back online, and
   reaching out to these guests to apologize and fully refund them for the
   cost of their stay,” Papas, Airbnb’s spokesman, said in an email. Both
   McCree and El-Hoshy confirmed to Quartz that their reviews had been
   posted.

   After Donna Oakley noticed that her two-paragraph Airbnb review of the
   Winston-Salem condo had been rewritten as a single sentence, she
   contacted support again to ask why it had been changed. “This was a
   nightmare situation and I don’t want anyone else to ever be duped into
   renting,” Oakley wrote to support, according to screenshots of messages
   she shared with Quartz. “This property is a poor reflection of Airbnb
   and I’m sure if it had been my first it would have been my last.”

   When Airbnb replied, it didn’t explain why Oakley’s review had been
   condensed and modified, but noted that its reviews are limited to 500
   words (Oakley submitted just over 300). “At this point we are unable to
   help you complete the review as you desire,” the support rep said.
   “Thank you for your understanding on this matter.” Oakley said all her
   messages with Airbnb about the Winston-Salem condo have since
   disappeared from her Airbnb account, as has any record of her booking
   the property.

   Airbnb, after being told about the incident by Quartz, initially
   suggested that “the guest might have left comments in a section that
   isn’t public” and said it couldn’t “find any record of the review being
   changed.” (Oakley said she’s sure she posted her comments in the
   correct place.) The company said, as a general policy, it doesn’t edit
   reviews.

   Oakley used to encourage all her friends to use Airbnb, but after the
   Winston-Salem experience she doesn’t plan to proselytize it anymore. “I
   have always been like, you’ve got to try it, let me show you what to
   do,” she said. “And now I’m like, the reviews are not even true.”

Here are the top 10 cryptoassets of 2017 (and bitcoin’s 1,000% rise doesn’t
even make the list)

   By Joon Ian WongJanuary 1, 2018

   Bitcoin’s value grew by more than 1,000% in 2017, but that wasn’t
   enough to even place it among the 10 best-performing cryptoassets of
   the year.

   In a breakout year for cryptocurrency trading, the biggest winners were
   Ripple, which is touted as a new kind of payment system for banks,
   along with less familiar names like NEM, Ardor, and Dash. Here are the
   top 10 cryptoassets of 2017—plus bitcoin, which came in 14th place:
   Chart from TheAtlas.com

   Cryptoassets include standalone cryptocurrencies as well as tokens
   issued on the ethereum blockchain. Our ranking is based on a comparison
   of the yearlong gains made by the 10 most valuable cryptoassets as of
   Jan. 1, 2018, as measured by data provider CoinMarketcap.

   Ripple’s big gains—it rose an astonishing 36,000%—came largely at the
   tail end of the year. Here’s how its 2017 looked compared to bitcoin:
   Chart from TheAtlas.com

   Bitcoin fares slightly better when compared against rival
   cryptocurrencies, meaning tokens with their own blockchains. This
   excludes tokens issued through so-called initial coin offerings (ICOs),
   which were a craze last year. Bitcoin makes it to eighth place in this
   ranking, although it’s still trounced by ethereum and litecoin:
   Chart from TheAtlas.com

   The ICO craze attracted over $3.7 billion in funds this year, according
   to data provider Coin Schedule. Many of these projects only launched
   months ago. Yet big names like Golem and OmiseGo lagged behind lesser
   known ones like Ardor in the performance charts.
   Chart from TheAtlas.com

   Bitcoin’s performance may seem lackluster compared to its newer,
   shinier, brethren, but it’s worth putting its gains in context. After
   all, the Nasdaq Composite Index gained 27% last year.

   It’s difficult to imagine cryptoassets delivering another year of crazy
   gains in 2018. Traders who are thinking of cashing out may benefit from
   this Quartz guide to paying your taxes on those cryptoasset profits.

   No two composts are alike.
   Sponsor Content By BASF

These maps show how the world composts

   By gbaconqzJune 3, 2014

   Composting is far from underground now. The practice has blossomed into
   a movement. In much of the world, compost has even spread from the
   backyard to the curb. Yet its role in our sustainability imperative can
   grow much more.

   Eco-friendly communities around the world are making composting part of
   their efforts. From Serenbe, Georgia to Earthsong, New Zealand, people
   are living with the environment in mind to various degrees–practicing
   green construction, organic and well-managed gardening, recycling,
   reliance on renewable power, and sharing of housing amenities.

   Recovering waste from food is key to sustainability, as the latest EPA
   statistics from 2012 show (fact sheet PDF here). Americans generated
   36.43 million tons of food waste and sent 34.69 million tons of that to
   landfills, meaning that only 1.74 million tons, or 4.8% of the total
   waste, were recovered or recycled.

   Increased composting is becoming a clear alternative to the range of
   costs associated with landfill waste. Even New York City, where density
   and infrastructure have been obstacles in the past, began a pilot
   composting program last summer that is on track to become mandatory and
   citywide.

   The west coast provides substantial inspiration. Cities like San
   Francisco have had large programs in place for years. A new effort in
   Portland reportedly cut curbside trash by 44 percent. In general,
   recent data mapped out here situates the western U.S. at the national
   forefront, though Canada’s results are even more impressive.

   Europe has also shown a strong commitment to the practice. While data
   for the rest of the world is scarce, communities from India to
   Australia are adopting compost as a key part of sustainability efforts.

   The rise in composting is based in its straightforward benefits.
   Allowing organic matter to break down naturally and putting it to use
   in gardens does wonders for the quality of soil and plants. Composting
   is also a small burden on the patient composter, as time and nature do
   most of the work.

   Composting more current waste would dramatically reduce what ends up in
   landfills, but so can making more waste compostable in the first place.
   BASF’s ecovio is a bioplastic that is made of biobased content and is
   certified compostable. It can replace the materials in noncompostable
   plastic bags, shrink wraps, foam packaging and coatings on paper
   products without sacrificing the strength and performance of
   conventional plastics.

   BASF has used ecovio in successful sustainability projects around the
   world, but this important amplifier of composting’s impact is still
   developing. Bioplastics expand the composting map. Before we overwork
   the earth, we must work better with it.

   team and not by the Quartz editorial staff.

   Expanding AI for surveillance
   SOMEBODY'S WATCHING YOU

Chinese firms are driving the rise of AI surveillance across Africa

   By Abdi Latif DahirSeptember 18, 2019

   Artificial intelligence technology is proliferating fast across the
   world and is being deployed in applications from speech recognition to
   deepfake videos and monitoring traffic congestion. It’s also
   increasingly being used to monitor and track citizens, according to a
   new report.

   At least 75 out of 176 nations surveyed globally are actively using AI
   technologies for surveillance purposes, according to the Carnegie
   Endowment for International Peace. These include facial recognition
   systems, smart policing tools, and the establishment of safe city
   platforms. The leading vendors of these systems globally are Chinese
   firms, led by Huawei, which has supplied these technologies to at least
   50 states worldwide.

   The study’s author, Steven Feldstein, wrote these tools were being used
   to “accomplish a range of policy objectives—some lawful, others that
   violate human rights, and many of which fall into a murky middle
   ground.”

   African countries are still struggling to adopt AI technologies, with
   the report noting that less than one-quarter of countries investing in
   these systems. That’s partly explained by the fact the continent is
   still struggling with internet connectivity.

   Yet Chinese companies are quickly penetrating African markets, offering
   soft loans for governments to purchase their equipment and promising to
   set up and manage these systems. In Kenya, for instance, Huawei has
   helped install video systems that deployed 1,800 HD cameras and 200 HD
   traffic surveillance systems across Nairobi. In Zimbabwe, the
   Guangzhou-based developer CloudWalk announced a controversial deal in
   2018 to oversee a large-scale facial recognition program in
   collaboration with authorities.

   Most of these arrangements have come under scrutiny especially in light
   of how China harnesses technology for social control—particularly among
   ethnic Uyghur Muslims in its restive northwestern Xinjiang region.
   Chart from TheAtlas.com


   The debate over AI technologies also comes as African governments and
   activists clash over issues including digital privacy, information
   censorship, surveillance, and internet shutdowns. With the dearth of
   privacy laws in nations like Kenya, there’s concern about how
   governments will use these repositories of data, where they will be
   stored, and who will have access to them.

   By following China’s lead, there’s also unease that information and
   communications technologies could be used to intimidate and coerce
   critics of the state. Last year, the US-based think tank Freedom House
   claimed Beijing was training African states on some of its own
   restrictive online measures.

   As its operations proliferate, Huawei’s involvement in Africa has come
   under scrutiny in recent years. In 2018, the company denied allegations
   the tech infrastructure it installed at the African Union was used by
   China to spy on the continental body. A recent investigation by the
   Wall Street Journal also showed Huawei technicians allegedly helped
   cybersecurity forces in Uganda and Zambia intercept the communications
   and track down opponents. Uganda’s cash-strapped police also bought
   closed-circuit television cameras for $126 million from Huawei—a move
   opposition figures worry could be used to identify and target
   demonstrators and opposition figures ahead of the 2021 polls.

   Despite these allegations, African states have remained loyal to both
   China and Huawei, collaborating on rolling out 5G networks and boosting
   sectors like cloud computing and artificial intelligence.

   China, however, is not the only country using or supplying advanced
   surveillance tech worldwide. Democracies such as the United States and
   France have deployed them for surveillance too, while companies in
   Japan and Germany are helping spread them worldwide.

   He’s wearing his fanny pack all wrong.
   (BUM BAGS, ACTUALLY)

Fanny packs are generating nearly a quarter of the US accessories industry’s
growth

   By Natasha FrostDecember 8, 2018

   You may know it as a bum bag, a travel pouch, a belly bag, a belt bag,
   or even a butt pack. But whatever you call it, the fanny pack is having
   a moment.

   Back in July, Quartz fashion reporter Marc Bain noted that fanny packs
   were “in the midst of a major revival,” with iterations arriving from
   such high-powered brands as Alexander Wang, Louis Vuitton, and
   Gucci. The extent of that revival, however, may surprise you. Despite
   making up just 1% of fashion-accessories sales, fanny packs
   were responsible for nearly 25% of the industry’s growth in the first
   10 months of this year, according to market-research firm NPD Group.
   That’s quite an achievement for an accessory that’s been around
   since 3400 BCE.

   Fashion-accessory sales overall grew 4% in the same period, following
   years of decline. Other strong sellers include backpacks and suitcases.

   If you’re contemplating wading into the weird and wonderful world of
   fanny packs, there are plenty of options—not just which one you buy,
   but also how you wear it. Fanny packs can go over your behind or around
   your middle; they can be slung over the shoulder or across the
   chest. It’s a trend that looks equally good (or bad) on everyone,
   regardless of size or shape, color or creed.

   Not even gender is a barrier. “Fanny packs, or ‘waist bags’ as we now
   call them, are the fastest-growing segment in the men’s accessories
   market,” an analyst from NPD Group told the Wall Street
   Journal (paywall) last year. Fanny pack sales of $100 million between
   September 2016 and September 2017 sounded staggering at the time—but
   clearly it was just the tip of the iceberg. Buckle up.
