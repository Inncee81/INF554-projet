   You’ll make 36 repayments of €140.61 (excluding optional insurance) for

   of the loan is €61.96, including arrangement fees, or an effective
   annual interest rate (fixed EAIR) of 0.8%. Total amount repaid:
   €5,061.96 (excluding optional insurance). Optional insurance (payment
   protection in the event of death or permanent disability) costs

   total cost of insurance over the entire term of the loan €22.68.

   A loan is a major financial commitment and must be repaid in full.
   Please make sure you can afford the repayments before you commit.

   applicable, make interim tax payments. Finally, under certain
   conditions, the portion of the value represented by real estate assets
   or shares of corporations or organisations held in these accounts must
   be declared for property wealth tax purposes if the holders concerned
   are liable to this tax. Moreover, under current regulations,
   individuals domiciled for tax purposes in France are required to
   include details in their tax return of capitalisation contracts and
   similar investments, particularly life insurance policies, underwritten
   by organisations established outside France and, where appropriate, any
   income earned upon surrendering these policies. Furthermore, these
   individuals must pay social contributions due in relation to their
   contract or policy. Finally, the surrender value of redeemable
   insurance policies and capitalisation bonds or contracts, for the
   portion of their value represented by units of account composed of
   taxable property assets, must be declared for property wealth tax
   purposes if the holders are liable to this tax. Tax adjustments and
   penalties will be applied if these obligations are not met. For further
   information regarding these tax obligations and declarations, we
   recommend that you speak to an independent advisor.

More details on the PEA

What is the PEA ?

   Le Plan d'Epargne en Actions (PEA or shared savings plan) is a
   tax-privileged plan that allows you to invest and manage a portfolio of
   eligible French and European securities (eg. shares, units of certain
   UCIs, etc.) while taking advantage of an attractive taxation framework.

   The PEA consists of a Securities Account and a cash account intended to
   receive your payments, proceeds from the sale of securities or
   dividends, and other products while awaiting their investment.

   The shares of UCIs established in a Member State of the European
   Community as well as in Iceland, Norway or Liechtenstein, "coordinated"
   within the meaning of the European regulations and whose assets are
   permanently composed of a minimum of 75% of securities are eligible for
   the PEA.

   Note: Since March 20, 2012, the transfer from France of the fiscal
   domicile of the holder of a PEA no longer automatically entails the
   closing of the plan, except if this transfer takes place in an ETNC
   within the meaning of Article 238-0 A of the CGI.

   An exemption from income tax from 5 years of detention^(1).


An answer to each objective

     * Build or foster long-term capital. Do you want to invest a portion
       of your savings in the stock market while benefiting from a tax
       exemption on your income and your capital gains? The PEA allows you
       to make payments in cash up to € 150,000 per person, €300,000 for a
       married couple or civil partnerships ^(2). You benefit, from 5
       years of detention, a privileged tax regime ^(1) that allows you to
       enjoy the fruits of your savings!
     * The Equity Savings Plan works like a traditional securities account
       and allows you to invest as you wish in European markets. You
       manage your own portfolio and invest in the European financial
       markets (shares, units of certain UCIs, etc.).
     * Prepare for retirement by securing additional income that is exempt
       from income tax

   In addition to traditional savings with the Stock Savings Plan. After 8
   years in custody, you can close your PEA and convert your capital into
   a life annuity exempt from income tax. You thus ensure regular income
   for your retirement, without taxation, with the exception of applicable
   social security contributions (except for non-French tax residents).

   (1) Lingua Custodia offers any individual the opportunity to try its
   online translation service (beta version) free of charge for 3 months,
   up to a maximum of three types of documents: rental, home and
   employment insurance contracts. HSBC offers you simplified and faster
   access to this service as part of an offer reserved for any adult
   individual capable, excluding students, of opening their first account
   with HSBC France before 30 September 2019. The simplified access link
   will be sent after the account has been opened and will allow access to
   Lingua Custodia's translation service for 3 months under the above
   conditions. Offer limited to the first 1000 new customers. Offer can be
   combined with other current offers, limited to one access per person or
   per tax household in the event of opening a joint bank account. The
   terms and conditions of the translation service are those of the
   General Terms and Conditions signed directly between the client and
   Lingua Custodia and for which HSBC France is neither a party nor a
   guarantor. HSBC France cannot be held responsible for the performance
   of these services by Lingua Custodia and the consequences of such
   performance for users.

   (2) Except on public holidays.

   (3) "My International Accounts" service in your online space. For HSBC
   France, the accounts eligible for "My international transfers" are
   deposit accounts denominated in euros.

   We remind you that according to the regulations in force, individuals,
   associations, and companies not having the commercial form, domiciled
   or established for tax purposes in France, are required to declare,
   when declaring their income or results, the accounts opened, held, used
   or closed abroad as well as the related income. In addition, as soon as
   individuals receive income from movable property through these
   accounts, they must pay social security contributions and, where
   applicable, a down payment of income tax. Finally, under certain
   conditions, the portion of the representative value of real estate
   assets of shares or shares in companies or organisations held in these
   accounts must be declared for tax purposes if the holders concerned are
   liable for it. In addition, under current regulations, individuals
   domiciled for tax purposes in France are required to declare, when
   filing their income tax returns, certain information relating to
   capitalisation contracts and investments of the same nature, and in
   particular life insurance contracts, taken out with organisations
   established outside France and, where applicable, the income generated
   on these contracts when they are fully or partially surrendered. In
   addition, the latter must also pay the social security contributions
   due under their contract. Finally, the surrender value of surrenderable
   insurance contracts and capitalisation warrants or contracts up to the
   fraction of their representative value of units of account composed of
   taxable real estate assets must be declared for tax purposes if the
   holders concerned are liable for it. In the event of non-compliance
   with these obligations, the persons concerned are exposed to tax
   reminders and the application of sanctions. For further details
   regarding your reporting and tax obligations, we recommend that you
   consult an independent adviser.

   (4) Offer valid for a first subscription of 3, 6 or 12 months to learn
   a language. Subscription fees for Babbel language courses available on
   www.babbel.com. Offer reserved for individual HSBC France customers,
   can be combined with other current offers, limited to one access per
   person or per tax household. To benefit from the offer, the customer
   must register with Babbel via the link dedicated to HSBC customers.
   Offer valid as of June 1, 2019, subject to change/deletion at any time.
   The terms and conditions of the Babbel service are those of the
   contract signed directly between the customer and Babbel and for which
   HSBC France is neither a party nor a guarantor. HSBC France cannot be
   held responsible for the performance of these services by Babbel and
   the consequences of such performance for users.
