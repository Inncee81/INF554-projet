Marlon Brando

   Born on 3rd April 1924, Marlon Brando Jr., known for his captivating
   screen presence, is believed by many to be the greatest actor of all
   time. He won two Academy Awards for his performances in On the
   Waterfront (1955) and The Godfather (1972), though he famously rejected
   his second Academy Award in protest against the treatment of Native
   Americans by the film industry. He is remembered for his "bad boy"
   reputation. In fact, the road he lived on in Beverley Hills was
   nicknamed "Bad Boy Drive", as Brando, Warren Beatty and Jack Nicholson
   all lived on it - all notorious Hollywood "bad boys." He also never
   learnt his lines. Instead, from early on in his acting career, he
   relied on cue cards held by other cast members or taped to walls!

The Flying Platform

   A fabulous way for picking up friends and nipping in to town. The
   flying platform was created in 1955 by the US Navy. It used a direct
   lift rotor aircraft, using contra-rotating ducted fans (controlled by
   the pilot shifting his body weight around).
   Sadly development ceased because they were considered too impractical
   as combat vehicles due to their small size, limited speed and they
   barely flew out of the ground cushion effect. How different life could
   have been...

Death Jump – Eiffel Tower

   In February 1912, the inventor Franz Reichelt had gained permission to
   test his self designed parachute from the Eiffel Tower. The press and
   Pathé cameras were all invited to witness his jump. The first time
   Reichelt went up the tower, he actually turned back after getting
   scared. However, after some persuasion from his manager, he climbed the
   tower again. The film shows Reichelt teetering on the edge and after
   hesitating for awhile, he jumps off but plummets straight down to his
   death.

       I find this very sad. In a way it morrors the way the managers
       where I work expect me to do things they are not prepared to do.
       Obviously, a man's life was not held in very high esteem in those
       days.

       Daft commentary, she was just a low tech suicide bomber, it was
       only by luck that no-one else was killed. And World War 1 was the
       main cause of women getting the vote, not her "brave act"

       The image you have here is not a DH110 but a Gloster Javelin which
       does appear in the following film footage but is not the aircraft
       that crashed.

       I, too, find the death of Reichert terribly sad, not just a subject
       of ridicule or a trope for social media. The pressure and fear he
       must have felt as he teetered on the brink of life or death ... his
       inability to swallow it up and say yes, I can live with the shame
       of failure.
       It's not so different from the rest of us if we dig into ourselves
       deep enough,
       The only one I condemn is his manager/death enabler, urging him to
       go on, go on, you can't stop now. May he burn eternally in a
       special circle of hell,

       It proves the old saying "It isn't what you don't know that will
       hurt you rather the things you know 'for sure' that aren't so."

       Emily Davison was not 'just a low tech suicide bomber'. Current
       thinking supports the view that she intended to place a silk scarf
       saying votes for women [currently on display in Parliament] on the
       rear of the horse so that it would be flying from the King's horse
       as a massive publicity stunt at the sporting event of the year. She
       had not intended to kill herself.
       To argue it was a single cause is rather mistaken and simplistic.
       Only women over 30 got the vote, the ones the Liberals and
       Conservatives thought would vote for them. The young women who
       supported the war effort were not rewarded. Asquith no longer was
       in power, whereas Lloyd George was more sympathetic to their cause.
       Women had been enfranchised in other countries so why weren't they
       in the mother country, the home of democracy? The work of the
       women's suffrage had convinced many, and the government was no
       longer giving into militancy of suffragettes which was forgotten in
       the face of their strong support of the war.

       You will be writing next the old but publically accepted and
       interminably repeated lie that she 'threw herself' under the King's
       horse. See Claire Balding's analysis of the original footage.

       " The Death Jump " Peaple did not have a clue back then how aero
       dynamice worked ,so they thought they could fly like a bird if they
       made wings ,unfortunatly it was a learn by you'r mistakes cenarieo
       and they did.mnt realise by jumping off the eyeful tower you just
       do not get a second chance ,we got it in the end but what
       sacrifices to get there I would surly like those people to see the
       end result in aviation.to day. :0)).
