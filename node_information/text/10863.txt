Accelerated Ray Tracing: Testing NVIDIA’s RTX In Blender 2.81 Alpha
       NVIDIA’s RTX features may be a bit of a slow starter in games, but
       on the creative side, it’s a different story. We’re taking a look
       at Blender’s latest 2.81 alpha build and see NVIDIA’s OptiX render
       engine in action, leveraging the power of the RT cores to
       accelerate ray traced workloads. The results are impressive.
