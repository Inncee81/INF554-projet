We’re transforming media for the benefit of humankind

   The Trade Desk: Media for Humankind

   Advertising — it’s what fuels the open internet and supports content
   creators, journalists, and the open exchange of information and ideas.
   We built our media-buying platform to power a more engaging and
   inspiring ecosystem for everyone.

   Our mission is to transform media for the benefit of humankind. How? By
   helping brands deliver a more insightful and relevant ad experience for
   consumers, and setting a new standard for global reach, accuracy, and
   transparency. Learn what makes us different.

Independence.

   We’re on the buy side. Which is everyone’s side. We never steer you
   toward our own media assets, because we don’t own any. It’s
   that simple.

Reach.

   One billion. That’s how many more people you can reach with The Trade
   Desk than with other major media-buying platforms.

Objectivity.

   We want you to spend your ad dollars where your data leads you. That
   allows for transparency in everything we do — from pricing and
   inventory to measurement and reporting.

Open.

   An open internet starts with an open platform. Which is why we built
   one. Our APIs are open too, so you get more value from your
   first-party data.

The whole of media should work for all of us, not just some of us.
