Bob Odenkirk Teases 'Better Call Saul' Season 5: "Everything's on Fire and
It's Burning Down Around Us"

The star also talks about the secrecy of the upcoming 'Breaking Bad' movie,
set to release on Netflix and AMC next year.

   In the world of AMC's Better Call Saul, the journey of Jimmy McGill
   becoming Saul Goodman has been a slow buildup for audiences, but the
   season four finale pushed it one step closer following McGill
   announcing he'll be practicing law under a different name: "S'all good,
   man."

   "They've been building it slowly but it's turning. Now it’s turning
   rapidly, I would say," Odenkirk told In Studio With The Hollywood
   Reporter of the AMC series, which earned 11 Emmy nominations, including
   best lead actor in a drama series. "That’s similar to Breaking Bad,
   too. This very slow buildup as we go up the roller-coaster ramp and
   then, it starts going downhill, it just cannot stop. And that's where
   we are in season five, which we’re shooting right now."

   "Season five is just everything's on fire, and it’s just burning down
   around us," he added.

   The constant uphill trek to becoming Saul Goodman had Odenkirk worried
   about audiences sticking with the series through the four seasons.

   "I was worried about the audiences staying with us. We asked people to
   watch closely and to understand on a deeper level the characters and
   the plot, and you know what? They did," he explained. "The audience
   really impressed the hell out of me. But I do think that it was all
   because of Breaking Bad and not just because of the success of Breaking
   Bad, but because people who watched Breaking Bad knew that every detail
   matters, the eye floating in the water, it means something. And so by
   getting a large audience to watch on that level, then when Better Call
   Saul started, they immediately were hooked into watching closely and
   not worrying about it getting somewhere but trusting that it would."

   Odenkirk also touched on the upcoming, highly anticipated Breaking Bad
   movie, a sequel involving Aaron Paul, set to release on AMC and Netflix
   in 2020.

   "I've heard so many different things about it, but I am excited about
   the Breaking Bad movie. I can't wait to see it," he told In Studio.

   Speaking on the secrecy surrounding the film, Odenkirk said, "I don't
   know what people know and don't know. I find it hard to believe you
   don't know it was shot. They did it. You know what I mean? How is that
   a secret? But it is. They've done an amazing job of keeping it a
   secret."

Miles Teller Nabs Goose's Son Role in 'Top Gun' Sequel

   July 03, 2018 12:06pm by Borys Kit
   Teller will star opposite Tom Cruise in the long-in-the works sequel
   that sees Cruise reprising his role as the hotshot pilot with the call
   sign Maverick.

   Miles Teller has landed the role of Goose's son in Top Gun 2 and will
   star opposite Tom Cruise, reprising his role from the 1986 original as
   the hotshot pilot with the call sign Maverick.

   Joseph Kosinski, who directed Cruise in the sci-fi thriller Oblivion,
   is directing the long-in-the-works Top Gun sequel, which is also
   bringing back Val Kilmer's rival pilot code-named Iceman.

This Week In Heat Vision breakdown

   The role of Goose's son was a coveted one and many of young Hollywood's
   finest were chasing it, even traveling to Cruise's home in Clearwater,
   Florida, for the testing process.

   Teller beat out Nicholas Hoult and Glen Powell for the role. Dylan
   O'Brien and Austin Butler were among those in the mix in a previous
   stage.

   Teller will play the son of Maverick's wingman and best pal, Goose.
   Played by Anthony Edwards in the Tony Scott-directed original, the
   character provides an emotional spine to the movie when he is killed by
   accident and Maverick blames himself.

   Teller last starred in a pair of gritty dramas, Thank You for Your
   Service and Only the Brave, the true-life firefighting movie that
   Kosinski directed. The Spectacular Now and Whiplash helped establish
   his chops early on.

   The actor will return to the show's world in 'El Camino,' a sequel
   focusing on Aaron Paul's Jesse Pinkman.

   Jesse Pinkman's buddies are alive and well — or at least alive — in the
   Breaking Bad sequel movie.

   A teaser for El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie features Skinny Pete
   (Charles Baker) refusing to tell police whether he knows Jesse's (Aaron
   Paul) whereabouts. Matt Jones, who played Jesse's friend and
   drug-dealing and -using partner Badger in the series, will also appear
   in the film, The Hollywood Reporter has learned.

   Jones appeared in a dozen episodes across all five seasons of Breaking
   Bad's initial run on AMC. He was last seen in the series finale as he
   and Skinny Pete posed as unseen hitmen to help ensure Walter White's
   (Bryan Cranston) former business partners set up a trust for Walt's
   kids.

   Other details about El Camino, which will premiere Oct. 11 on Netflix
   and later air on AMC, are scarce. The description of the movie refers
   only to Jesse, saying, "In the wake of his dramatic escape from
   captivity, Jesse must come to terms with his past in order to forge
   some kind of future."

   In his last scene in the series, Jesse flees the neo-Nazi compound
   where he'd been imprisoned and forced to cook meth following Walt's
   final act to wipe out his partner's captors.

   Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan wrote and directed El Camino. Mark
   Johnson, Melissa Bernstein, Charles Newirth, Diane Mercer and Paul
   produce in association with series producer Sony Pictures TV.

   Following Breaking Bad, Jones went on to Chuck Lorre's CBS comedy Mom.
   Other recent credits include features Brightburn and The Turkey
   Bowl. He also appears in another Lorre comedy for CBS, Bob Hearts
   Abishola, which premieres Sept. 23.
