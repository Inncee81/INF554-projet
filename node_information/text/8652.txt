Harvard just put more than 6 million court cases online to give legal AI a
boost

   Image of Harvard Law School.

   After five years of work, nearly 6.5 million US court cases are now
   available to access for free online.

   The news: The Library Innovation Lab at the Harvard Law School Library
   has completed its Caselaw Access Project, an endeavour to digitize
   every reported state and federal US legal case from the 1600s to last
   summer. The process involved scanning more than 40 million pages.

   Why is this needed? One of the biggest hurdles to developing artificial
   intelligence for legal applications is the lack of access to data. To
   train their software, legal AI companies have often had to build their
   own databases by scraping whatever websites have made information
   public and making deals with companies for access to their private
   legal files.

   What it means: Now that millions of cases are online for free, a good
   training source will be easily available. Programs will also be able to
   more easily search case text to provide lawyers with relevant
   background research for cases. As Adam Ziegler, the managing director
   of the Library Innovation Lab, told us last year: “I think there will
   be a lot more experimentation, and the progress will accelerate. It’s
   really hard to build a smart interface if you can’t get to the basic
   data.”

These bionic shorts help turn an epic hike into a leisurely stroll

   An Exosuit for running and walking.

   Forget the Thighmaster. Someday you might add a spring to your step
   when walking or running using a pair of mechanically powered shorts.

   Step up: The lightweight exoskeleton-pants were developed by
   researchers at Harvard University and the University of Nebraska,
   Omaha. They are the first device to assist with both walking and
   running, using an algorithm that adapts to each gait.

   Making strides: The super-shorts show how wearable exoskeleton
   technology might someday help us perform all sorts of tasks. Progress
   in materials, actuators, and machine learning has led to a new
   generation of lighter, more powerful, and more adaptive wearable
   systems. Bulkier and heavier commercial systems are already used to
   help people with disabilities and workers in some factories and
   warehouses.

   In step: The new “exosuit” is made of soft materials that attach around
   the waist and thighs and an actuator that attaches to the lower back.
   Its function is controlled by an algorithm that detects the transition
   from walking to running, motions that are significantly different and
   require different actuation. Details of the system appear in the
   journal Science today.

   Take a load off: The powered pants, which weigh 5 kilograms (11
   pounds), reduce a person’s metabolic work rate 9.3% when walking and 4%
   when running (equivalent to removing 12 to 17 pounds from the waist).
   “While the metabolic reductions we found are modest, our study
   demonstrates that it is possible to have a portable wearable robot
   assist more than just a single activity,” says Conor Walsh, a Harvard
   professor who specializes in lightweight exoskeletons.

Training a single AI model can emit as much carbon as five cars in their
lifetimes

Deep learning has a terrible carbon footprint.

     * by Karen Hao
     * June 6, 2019

   The artificial-intelligence industry is often compared to the oil
   industry: once mined and refined, data, like oil, can be a highly
   lucrative commodity. Now it seems the metaphor may extend even further.
   Like its fossil-fuel counterpart, the process of deep learning has an
   outsize environmental impact.

   In a new paper, researchers at the University of Massachusetts,
   Amherst, performed a life cycle assessment for training several common
   large AI models. They found that the process can emit more than 626,000
   pounds of carbon dioxide equivalent—nearly five times the lifetime
   emissions of the average American car (and that includes manufacture of
   the car itself).

   IFRAME: //datawrapper.dwcdn.net/VQEvf/3/

   It’s a jarring quantification of something AI researchers have
   suspected for a long time. “While probably many of us have thought of
   this in an abstract, vague level, the figures really show the magnitude
   of the problem,” says Carlos Gómez-Rodríguez, a computer scientist at
   the University of A Coruña in Spain, who was not involved in the
   research. “Neither I nor other researchers I’ve discussed them with
   thought the environmental impact was that substantial.”

The carbon footprint of natural-language processing

   The paper specifically examines the model training process for
   natural-language processing (NLP), the subfield of AI that focuses on
   teaching machines to handle human language. In the last two years, the
   NLP community has reached several noteworthy performance milestones in
   machine translation, sentence completion, and other standard
   benchmarking tasks. OpenAI’s infamous GPT-2 model, as one example,
   excelled at writing convincing fake news articles.

   But such advances have required training ever larger models on
   sprawling data sets of sentences scraped from the internet. The
   approach is computationally expensive—and highly energy intensive.

   The researchers looked at four models in the field that have been
   responsible for the biggest leaps in performance: the Transformer,
   ELMo, BERT, and GPT-2. They trained each on a single GPU for up to a
   day to measure its power draw. They then used the number of training
   hours listed in the model’s original papers to calculate the total
   energy consumed over the complete training process. That number was
   converted into pounds of carbon dioxide equivalent based on the average
   energy mix in the US, which closely matches the energy mix used by
   Amazon’s AWS, the largest cloud services provider.

   IFRAME: //datawrapper.dwcdn.net/wVVI7/5/

   They found that the computational and environmental costs of training
   grew proportionally to model size and then exploded when additional
   tuning steps were used to increase the model’s final accuracy. In
   particular, they found that a tuning process known as neural
   architecture search, which tries to optimize a model by incrementally
   tweaking a neural network’s design through exhaustive trial and error,
   had extraordinarily high associated costs for little performance
   benefit. Without it, the most costly model, BERT, had a carbon
   footprint of roughly 1,400 pounds of carbon dioxide equivalent, close
   to a round-trip trans-America flight for one person.

   What’s more, the researchers note that the figures should only be
   considered as baselines. “Training a single model is the minimum amount
   of work you can do,” says Emma Strubell, a PhD candidate at the
   University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and the lead author of the paper.
   In practice, it’s much more likely that AI researchers would develop a
   new model from scratch or adapt an existing model to a new data set,
   either of which can require many more rounds of training and tuning.

   To get a better handle on what the full development pipeline might look
   like in terms of carbon footprint, Strubell and her colleagues used a
   model they’d produced in a previous paper as a case study. They found
   that the process of building and testing a final paper-worthy model
   required training 4,789 models over a six-month period. Converted to
   CO[2] equivalent, it emitted more than 78,000 pounds and is likely
   representative of typical work in the field.

   The significance of those figures is colossal—especially when
   considering the current trends in AI research. “In general, much of the
   latest research in AI neglects efficiency, as very large neural
   networks have been found to be useful for a variety of tasks, and
   companies and institutions that have abundant access to computational
   resources can leverage this to obtain a competitive advantage,”
   Gómez-Rodríguez says. “This kind of analysis needed to be done to raise
   awareness about the resources being spent [...] and will spark a
   debate.”

   “What probably many of us did not comprehend is the scale of it until
   we saw these comparisons,” echoed Siva Reddy, a postdoc at Stanford
   University who was not involved in the research.

The privatization of AI research

   The results underscore another growing problem in AI, too: the sheer
   intensity of resources now required to produce paper-worthy results has
   made it increasingly challenging for people working in academia to
   continue contributing to research.

   “This trend toward training huge models on tons of data is not feasible
   for academics—grad students especially, because we don’t have the
   computational resources,” says Strubell. “So there’s an issue of
   equitable access between researchers in academia versus researchers in
   industry.”

   Strubell and her coauthors hope that their colleagues will heed the
   paper’s findings and help level the playing field by investing in
   developing more efficient hardware and algorithms.

   Reddy agrees. “Human brains can do amazing things with little power
   consumption,” he says. “The bigger question is how can we build such
   machines.”

Rewriting Life

The Chinese scientist who claims he made CRISPR babies is under investigation

He Jiankui says he created twin girls whose genes were edited to make them
resistant to HIV. Was that ethical? Or even legal?

     * by Antonio Regalado
     * November 26, 2018

   A Chinese researcher who claims to have created the first gene-edited
   babies, He Jiankui of the Southern University of Science and Technology
   (SUST), in Shenzhen, is now facing investigation over whether the
   experiment broke Chinese laws or regulations.

   On Sunday, MIT Technology Review was first to disclose a secretive
   project in China to produce children whose genomes had been modified to
   make them resistant to HIV.

   He, who led that effort, later released a video statement in which he
   said that healthy twin girls, Lulu and Nana, had been born “a few weeks
   ago.”

   He said the girls had been conceived using IVF but that his team had
   added “a little protein and some information” to the fertilized eggs.
   That was a reference to the ingredients of CRISPR, the gene-editing
   technology he apparently employed to delete a gene called CCR5.

   The claim set off a wave of criticism in China and abroad from experts
   who said the experiment created unacceptable risks for a questionable
   medical purpose. Feng Zhang, one of the inventors of CRISPR, called for
   a moratorium on its use in editing embryos for IVF procedures.

   Documents connected to the trial named the study’s sponsors as He along
   with Jinzhou Qin and said it was approved by the ethics committee of
   HarMoniCare Shenzhen Women and Children’s Hospital.

   On Sunday, the Shenzhen City Medical Ethics Expert Board said it would
   begin an investigation of He’s research and released a statement
   saying that HarMoniCare “according to our findings … never conducted
   the appropriate reporting according to requirements.” The former
   medical director of the private hospital, Jiang Su-Qi,  told Southern
   Capital News he had no recollection of approving He’s research while he
   was on its ethics committee.

   “These two children are the guinea pigs. They will go through their
   whole maturing process having not understood the risks ahead of
   time,” said Liu Ying of Peking University’s Institute of Molecular
   Medicine.

   The president of He’s university called an emergency gathering of
   researchers connected to the project. “This has nothing to do with
   SUST, the research wasn’t conducted at SUST,” said SUST president Chen
   Shiyi, according to Chinese media reports. According to the school’s
   biology department, the research “seriously violates ethical and
   academic standards and regulations.”

   A 2003 guidance to Chinese IVF clinics prohibits the transfer of
   genetically modified embryos to start a pregnancy. He’s American media
   spokesman, Ryan Ferrell, did not respond to questions about the
   legality of the project.

   It remains unclear where He carried out his research and who paid for
   it. “He has explained to me that he electively went on leave years ago
   to focus full time on research and not teach,” Ferrell said.

   The news of the children’s birth comes on the eve of global
   gene-editing summit occurring in Hong Kong to debate governance of the
   powerful technology. The website Stat reports that the Chinese Academy
   of Sciences declined to sponsor the meeting and that it won’t
   officially be playing a role.

   Eric Topol, a doctor and scientist at the Scripps Research Institute,
   in La Jolla, California, said he had previously been provided
   information about the trial, but not enough to determine whether the
   gene editing had worked. “That is not good medicine,” he said. Topol
   criticized the absence of a scientific report describing the research.

   The report of the babies was just as big a surprise in China as
   elsewhere. “The consequences are impossible to predict,” said the
   vice-director of the Tsinghua University Comprehensive AIDS Research
   Center, Zhang Lin-Qi. “Most people are completely at a loss, including
   me.”

   Separately, a group of 122 Chinese academics and scientists put out a
   statement condemning He’s research and calling on authorities to
   establish legal governance over gene editing. “This presents a major
   blow to the image and development of Chinese life sciences on the
   global stage,” they said. “It is extremely unfair for the many honest
   and sincere scholars working to adhere to moral practices in the
   sciences.”

   In his video, He presented himself as a willing martyr to some higher
   cause. “I understand my work should be controversial, but families need
   this technology, and I am willing to take the criticism,” he said.

   Correction: Jiankui He has been on unpaid leave from the Southern
   University of Science and Technology. Due to a translation error, an
   earlier version of this story said his salary had been suspended.
