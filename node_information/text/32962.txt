The 12 Hour Autumn Edinburgh Itinerary

   I‚Äôve been lucky enough to visit Edinburgh a fair few times now- both in
   the summertime and winter, and it continues to be one of the most
   beautiful cities to explore and stay in.

An afternoon in rainy Edinburgh

   Arriving in Edinburgh, we‚Äôd of course bought with us the showers from
   Glasgow- which meant long leisurely strolls in these (clearly
   strategically selected) white dungarees were off the cards.

The Big Vintage Revival (And A Dream Dress To Boot)

   The year is 2009 (or 8, I‚Äôm terrible with dates). I‚Äôm on Brick Lane
   with a handful of my friends, and we‚Äôre rifling through rails of
   slightly musky ‚Äò80s floral dresses, wax jackets that smell slightly of
   old, damp National Trust properties and pointed ankle boots with fur
   lined ankles...

   AHH! It's the first of November- which means we pretty much just have

Back to Basics

   I know, I know- I'm a couple of days late... I was meant to post this
   on Saturday, but down to heaps of washing, life admin and a final few

A Big Ol‚Äô Catch Up

   Well hello there! It's been a hot minute since I've caught up on here,
   and although I feel like I've typed that sentence more times in the
   last few months than I have actually published things, I thought it
   time to get in a proper overdue catch up- before regularity sets back
   in after a long while...

AD | It‚Äôs Launch Day! My Collection With Papier‚Ä¶

   I‚Äôm still pinching myself about announcing this today. If you‚Äôd have
   told 7 year old Liv, swimming in Woolworth‚Äôs notebooks, scented gel
   pens, sticky Pritt stick fingers and magazine collage tear-outs, that
   one day she‚Äôd be creating her own stationery range, even with dreams of
   being an ice skater- she might‚Äôve thought that a bit far fetched...

     * *default cold weather outfit* ‚ùÑÔ∏èü§ß‚ùÑÔ∏è
     * As well as talking about endless book bits (which I cannot thank
       you ENOUGH for the kindness and support of), there‚Äôs also lots of
       shiny new blog content up on my blog, What Olivia Did- including
       new autumnal guides from both Glasgow and Edinburgh (and the best
       ever hot chocolate), a playlist and some other chatty posts, if you
       fancy some Sunday reading. I thought I‚Äôd upload this before I fall
       deep into an I‚Äôm A Celebrity and Strictly hole- and also ask if
       anyone has been to NY in January too- we may be planning a
       (belated) post wedding getaway... ‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è
     * IT‚ÄôS HERE! The official cover for The Insecure Girl‚Äôs Handbook is
       finally baked and ready which means it‚Äôs so, so close to being
       released into the world- AHH! How has it come round this quickly?!
       Although this one is a ~teeny~ bit different (sans lovely gold
       lettering), I‚Äôm so proud and excited of how she looks and can‚Äôt
       wait for you to all get your mitts on it. It‚Äôs been the biggest,
       most daunting, palm sweating and exciting thing I‚Äôve ever worked on
       and I can‚Äôt believe after all these months it‚Äôs *so* close to being
       out there. IT HAS A BARCODE AND EVERYTHING. Plus, I‚Äôm 10/10 excited
       to have @jasminedowling‚Äôs beautiful lettering on the cover too-
       what a DREAM. If you‚Äôd like to preorder (which I know everyone says
       to do, but it genuinely is so helpful), I‚Äôve popped both a link in
       my bio and stories- which would mean the absolute world if you‚Äôd
       like to take a look. I‚Äôm SO excited about this and really hope you
       are too- NOT LONG NOW! @theinsecuregirlsclub ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
     * As well as Edgar I also spend a lot of time thinking about these
       heavenly pjs and headboard... ‚òÅÔ∏è @johnlewisandpartners #ad
       #jlfashion #jlhome üì∑: @dunjaopalko
     * Killing time has never looked so beautiful- tripped and fell (quite
       literally, I‚Äôm a clumsy fool) into @miumiu and now all I can think
       about is glitter, velvet and collars ‚òÅÔ∏è‚òÅÔ∏è‚òÅÔ∏è‚òÅÔ∏è‚òÅÔ∏è
     * Cosy doorways in Edinburgh (and plenty of beautiful houses I‚Äôd
       happily occupy) on the blog this evening (amongst other things,
       it‚Äôs not just lovely doors folks) üçÇüçÇüçÇ
