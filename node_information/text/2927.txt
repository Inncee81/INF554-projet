Abstract

   This document defines a profile of ISO 8601, the International Standard
   for the representation of dates and times. ISO 8601 describes a large
   number of date/time formats. To reduce the scope for error and the
   complexity of software, it is useful to restrict the supported formats
   to a small number. This profile defines a few date/time formats, likely
   to satisfy most requirements.
     __________________________________________________________________

Introduction

   The International Standard for the representation of dates and times is
   ISO 8601. Its full reference number is ISO 8601 : 1988 (E), and its
   title is "Data elements and interchange formats - Information
   interchange - Representation of dates and times". A discussion of ISO
   8601 has been written by Markus Kuhn.

   ISO 8601 describes a large number of date/time formats. For example it
   defines Basic Format, without punctuation, and Extended Format, with
   punctuation, and it allows elements to be omitted. This profile defines
   a restricted range of formats, all of which are valid ISO 8601 dates
   and times. The aim is to simplify the use of ISO 8601 in World Wide
   Web-related standards, and to avoid the need for the developers and
   users of these standards to obtain copies of ISO 8601 itself.

   A particular problem with ISO 8601 is that it allows the century to be
   omitted from years, which is likely to cause trouble as we approach the
   year 2000. This profile avoids the problem by expressing the year as
   four digits in all cases.

   This profile may be adopted by standards which require an unambiguous
   representation of dates and times. As different standards have their
   own requirements regarding granularity and flexibility, this profile
   offers a number of options. An adopting standard must specify which of
   these options it permits.
     __________________________________________________________________

Formats

   Different standards may need different levels of granularity in the
   date and time, so this profile defines six levels. Standards that
   reference this profile should specify one or more of these
   granularities. If a given standard allows more than one granularity, it
   should specify the meaning of the dates and times with reduced
   precision, for example, the result of comparing two dates with
   different precisions.

   The formats are as follows. Exactly the components shown here must be
   present, with exactly this punctuation. Note that the "T" appears
   literally in the string, to indicate the beginning of the time element,
   as specified in ISO 8601.
   Year:
      YYYY (eg 1997)
   Year and month:
      YYYY-MM (eg 1997-07)
   Complete date:
      YYYY-MM-DD (eg 1997-07-16)
   Complete date plus hours and minutes:
      YYYY-MM-DDThh:mmTZD (eg 1997-07-16T19:20+01:00)
   Complete date plus hours, minutes and seconds:
      YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssTZD (eg 1997-07-16T19:20:30+01:00)
   Complete date plus hours, minutes, seconds and a decimal fraction of a
second
      YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sTZD (eg 1997-07-16T19:20:30.45+01:00)

   where:
     YYYY = four-digit year
     MM   = two-digit month (01=January, etc.)
     DD   = two-digit day of month (01 through 31)
     hh   = two digits of hour (00 through 23) (am/pm NOT allowed)
     mm   = two digits of minute (00 through 59)
     ss   = two digits of second (00 through 59)
     s    = one or more digits representing a decimal fraction of a second
     TZD  = time zone designator (Z or +hh:mm or -hh:mm)

   This profile does not specify how many digits may be used to represent
   the decimal fraction of a second. An adopting standard that permits
   fractions of a second must specify both the minimum number of digits (a
   number greater than or equal to one) and the maximum number of digits
   (the maximum may be stated to be "unlimited").

   This profile defines two ways of handling time zone offsets:
    1. Times are expressed in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time), with a
       special UTC designator ("Z").
    2. Times are expressed in local time, together with a time zone offset
       in hours and minutes. A time zone offset of "+hh:mm" indicates that
       the date/time uses a local time zone which is "hh" hours and "mm"
       minutes ahead of UTC. A time zone offset of "-hh:mm" indicates that
       the date/time uses a local time zone which is "hh" hours and "mm"
       minutes behind UTC.

   A standard referencing this profile should permit one or both of these
   ways of handling time zone offsets.

   'User agents' - web browsers, media players, browser extensions,
   on-the-fly converters, plug-ins, bots, aggregators and mobile browsers
   - provide a human or machine interface to the web. At their best, they
   allow all of us to explore a universal space of web content.

Examples of user agent standards issues

   User agent developers need to pay particular heed to issues surrounding
   use of their agents by people in other parts of the world, speaking
   other languages, using other devices and with a variety of assistive
   technologies that allow users to use different modes of input and
   output (such as speech input, tactile displays, semantic navigation,
   and a variety of display preferences).

   Example 1: An online app developer wants to provide context-sensitive
   help in a tooltip that is displayed when the user (with a mouse) hovers
   over or (with a keyboard) focuses a "Help" icon. In most browsers, the
   functionality automatically works for hover; the title element is
   displayed. However, most browsers don't provide the same functionality
   for keyboard users on focus. To compensate for the missing
   functionality in the browsers, the developer has to create scripts to
   provide it for her content. Unfortunately most developers don't do this
   - and indeed, they shouldn't have to because the browser should provide
   the same functionality for people who cannot use the mouse.

   Example 2: A developer uses the css declaration text-transform:
   lowercase to style a magazine headline (about fresh orange juice)
   originally composed in caps. The content is then internationalised for
   a Turkish-language audience, and a language of Turkish declared using
   the attribute lang="tr". The lower case of the Turkish character İ (a
   capital I dotted) should return a i. Major browsers, however convert
   the Turkish character I to i. An innocuous headline "Squeeze Often"
   suddenly becomes rather rude...

   W3C staff documented some Common User Agent Problems in a Team
   Submission, still a useful document although it was published in 2003.

Accessibility Guidelines for User Agents

   W3C publishes guidelines for creating accessible authoring tools: User
   Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG). UAAG 2.0 is intended for the
   current and future generation of user agents. You can implement the
   latest draft of the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG 2.0) by
   following Implementing UAAG 2.0 - a guide to implementing and
   understanding the guidelines.

   You may also wish to consult the current formally approved, stable and
   referenceable technical recommendation for accessibility is UAAG 1.0.

   Browser developers need some help at making the web readable by all;
   extension developers can respond to limitations of particular browser
   functionality, and the best extensions can be incorporated into the
   browsers' standard functionality. Whether you develop browsers,
   extensions, bots, aggregators, media players or an as-yet undreamed of
   way of reading the web, to create that web that is readable by all, the
   User Agent Accessibility Guidelines provide the place to start.

What does W3C do?

   W3C's primary activity is to develop protocols and guidelines that
   ensure long-term growth for the Web. W3C's standards define key parts
   of what makes the World Wide Web work. Learn more about W3C's mission.

Where is W3C located?

   W3C does not have a single physical headquarters. There are four
   institutions, however, that "host" W3C: MIT (in Cambridge, MA, USA),
   ERCIM (in Sophia-Antipolis, France), Keio University (near Tokyo,
   Japan), and Beihang University (in Beijing, China).

   The W3C staff is distributed around the world, but there are
   concentrations of people in Cambridge, Massachusetts (USA),
   Sophia-Antipolis (France), and Tokyo (Japan). In addition, W3C is
   represented in 17 other regions of the world via representatives based
   at organizations. W3C calls these regional points of contact "W3C
   Offices."

How is W3C funded?

   W3C receives funds from:
     * W3C Member dues
     * Research grants and other sources of private and public funding
     * Individual donations of money and equipment

What is the difference between the Web and the Internet?

   From the definition in the Wikipedia: "The Internet is a global system
   of interconnected computer networks that interchange data by packet
   switching using the standardized Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP)."

   Thus, the Internet is a network of networks, defined by the TPC/IP
   standards.

   The Web, on the other hand, is defined in W3C's Architecture of the
   World Wide Web, Volume I as follows: "The World Wide Web (WWW, or
   simply Web) is an information space in which the items of interest,
   referred to as resources, are identified by global identifiers called
   Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI)."

   Thus, the Web is an information space. The first three specifications
   for Web technologies defined URLs, HTTP, and HTML.

What does it mean that Tim Berners-Lee invented the Web?

   Tim Berners-Lee wrote a proposal in 1989 for a system called the World
   Wide Web. He then wrote the first Web browser, server, and Web page. He
   wrote the first specifications for URLs, HTTP, and HTML.

W3C has a validation service. Does W3C approve all Web pages?

   No. W3C does provide a free service for validating Web pages against
   standard formats. Although validation is not mandatory on the Web, it
   is useful for improving the quality of pages.

What is the difference between an open standard and open source software?

   In general terms: open source refers to software, and open standards
   refer to documents (that may then be implemented by software). There is
   no single definition global for either term.

   Some elements of openness that apply to W3C standards include:
     * All standards are available publicly at no cost
     * W3C adopted a Patent Policy in 2004 with the stated goal of
       assuring "that Recommendations produced under this policy can be
       implemented on a Royalty-Free (RF) basis."
     * W3C Process requires that groups address public comments
     * All technical comments are handled on their merits, whether they
       are made by W3C Members or public.
     * W3C's process is vendor-neutral.
     * W3C's persistence policy seeks to ensure that standards will be
       available at the same URI, unchanged, indefinitely.

Does W3C design Web sites? Can you recommend a designer?

   W3C is not in the business of designing Web sites. Although we greatly
   appreciate that many designers promote standards-based Web design, at
   the current time for reasons of neutrality, we cannot officially
   recommend any particular designers.

How do I get started building (or requesting) a standards-compliant Web site?

   W3C provides a list of resources that provides an introduction to
   standards-based design.

Do you have more FAQs?

   Yes. These additional FAQs are maintained by various people in the
   community; some are more up-to-date than others.

                                XHTML Vocabulary

   This is a vocabulary collection utilized by XHTML Family modules and
   document types using XHTML Modularization, including XHTML Role and
   XHTML + RDFa as defined in rdfa-syntax.

   The XHTML specifications are developed by the W3C XHTML 2 Working Group
   as part of the W3C HTML Activity.

   For more information about XML, please refer to the Extensible Markup
   Language (XML) 1.0 specification.

   Version date: 2010-01-27
     __________________________________________________________________

1. Introduction

   XHTML Modularization [XHTMLMOD] permits the development of XHTML
   modules and XHTML family markup languages. These modules and markup
   languages may, in turn, define local vocabulary items for use as values
   of attributes. This document describes the items that are available in
   the default XHTML vocabulary space:
   http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml/vocab#.

Abstract

   This document defines a profile of ISO 8601, the International Standard
   for the representation of dates and times. ISO 8601 describes a large
   number of date/time formats. To reduce the scope for error and the
   complexity of software, it is useful to restrict the supported formats
   to a small number. This profile defines a few date/time formats, likely
   to satisfy most requirements.
     __________________________________________________________________

Introduction

   The International Standard for the representation of dates and times is
   ISO 8601. Its full reference number is ISO 8601 : 1988 (E), and its
   title is "Data elements and interchange formats - Information
   interchange - Representation of dates and times". A discussion of ISO
   8601 has been written by Markus Kuhn.

   ISO 8601 describes a large number of date/time formats. For example it
   defines Basic Format, without punctuation, and Extended Format, with
   punctuation, and it allows elements to be omitted. This profile defines
   a restricted range of formats, all of which are valid ISO 8601 dates
   and times. The aim is to simplify the use of ISO 8601 in World Wide
   Web-related standards, and to avoid the need for the developers and
   users of these standards to obtain copies of ISO 8601 itself.

   A particular problem with ISO 8601 is that it allows the century to be
   omitted from years, which is likely to cause trouble as we approach the
   year 2000. This profile avoids the problem by expressing the year as
   four digits in all cases.

   This profile may be adopted by standards which require an unambiguous
   representation of dates and times. As different standards have their
   own requirements regarding granularity and flexibility, this profile
   offers a number of options. An adopting standard must specify which of
   these options it permits.
     __________________________________________________________________

Formats

   Different standards may need different levels of granularity in the
   date and time, so this profile defines six levels. Standards that
   reference this profile should specify one or more of these
   granularities. If a given standard allows more than one granularity, it
   should specify the meaning of the dates and times with reduced
   precision, for example, the result of comparing two dates with
   different precisions.

   The formats are as follows. Exactly the components shown here must be
   present, with exactly this punctuation. Note that the "T" appears
   literally in the string, to indicate the beginning of the time element,
   as specified in ISO 8601.
   Year:
      YYYY (eg 1997)
   Year and month:
      YYYY-MM (eg 1997-07)
   Complete date:
      YYYY-MM-DD (eg 1997-07-16)
   Complete date plus hours and minutes:
      YYYY-MM-DDThh:mmTZD (eg 1997-07-16T19:20+01:00)
   Complete date plus hours, minutes and seconds:
      YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssTZD (eg 1997-07-16T19:20:30+01:00)
   Complete date plus hours, minutes, seconds and a decimal fraction of a
second
      YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sTZD (eg 1997-07-16T19:20:30.45+01:00)

   where:
     YYYY = four-digit year
     MM   = two-digit month (01=January, etc.)
     DD   = two-digit day of month (01 through 31)
     hh   = two digits of hour (00 through 23) (am/pm NOT allowed)
     mm   = two digits of minute (00 through 59)
     ss   = two digits of second (00 through 59)
     s    = one or more digits representing a decimal fraction of a second
     TZD  = time zone designator (Z or +hh:mm or -hh:mm)

   This profile does not specify how many digits may be used to represent
   the decimal fraction of a second. An adopting standard that permits
   fractions of a second must specify both the minimum number of digits (a
   number greater than or equal to one) and the maximum number of digits
   (the maximum may be stated to be "unlimited").

   This profile defines two ways of handling time zone offsets:
    1. Times are expressed in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time), with a
       special UTC designator ("Z").
    2. Times are expressed in local time, together with a time zone offset
       in hours and minutes. A time zone offset of "+hh:mm" indicates that
       the date/time uses a local time zone which is "hh" hours and "mm"
       minutes ahead of UTC. A time zone offset of "-hh:mm" indicates that
       the date/time uses a local time zone which is "hh" hours and "mm"
       minutes behind UTC.

   A standard referencing this profile should permit one or both of these
   ways of handling time zone offsets.

   'User agents' - web browsers, media players, browser extensions,
   on-the-fly converters, plug-ins, bots, aggregators and mobile browsers
   - provide a human or machine interface to the web. At their best, they
   allow all of us to explore a universal space of web content.

Examples of user agent standards issues

   User agent developers need to pay particular heed to issues surrounding
   use of their agents by people in other parts of the world, speaking
   other languages, using other devices and with a variety of assistive
   technologies that allow users to use different modes of input and
   output (such as speech input, tactile displays, semantic navigation,
   and a variety of display preferences).

   Example 1: An online app developer wants to provide context-sensitive
   help in a tooltip that is displayed when the user (with a mouse) hovers
   over or (with a keyboard) focuses a "Help" icon. In most browsers, the
   functionality automatically works for hover; the title element is
   displayed. However, most browsers don't provide the same functionality
   for keyboard users on focus. To compensate for the missing
   functionality in the browsers, the developer has to create scripts to
   provide it for her content. Unfortunately most developers don't do this
   - and indeed, they shouldn't have to because the browser should provide
   the same functionality for people who cannot use the mouse.

   Example 2: A developer uses the css declaration text-transform:
   lowercase to style a magazine headline (about fresh orange juice)
   originally composed in caps. The content is then internationalised for
   a Turkish-language audience, and a language of Turkish declared using
   the attribute lang="tr". The lower case of the Turkish character İ (a
   capital I dotted) should return a i. Major browsers, however convert
   the Turkish character I to i. An innocuous headline "Squeeze Often"
   suddenly becomes rather rude...

   W3C staff documented some Common User Agent Problems in a Team
   Submission, still a useful document although it was published in 2003.

Accessibility Guidelines for User Agents

   W3C publishes guidelines for creating accessible authoring tools: User
   Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG). UAAG 2.0 is intended for the
   current and future generation of user agents. You can implement the
   latest draft of the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG 2.0) by
   following Implementing UAAG 2.0 - a guide to implementing and
   understanding the guidelines.

   You may also wish to consult the current formally approved, stable and
   referenceable technical recommendation for accessibility is UAAG 1.0.

   Browser developers need some help at making the web readable by all;
   extension developers can respond to limitations of particular browser
   functionality, and the best extensions can be incorporated into the
   browsers' standard functionality. Whether you develop browsers,
   extensions, bots, aggregators, media players or an as-yet undreamed of
   way of reading the web, to create that web that is readable by all, the
   User Agent Accessibility Guidelines provide the place to start.

What does W3C do?

   W3C's primary activity is to develop protocols and guidelines that
   ensure long-term growth for the Web. W3C's standards define key parts
   of what makes the World Wide Web work. Learn more about W3C's mission.

Where is W3C located?

   W3C does not have a single physical headquarters. There are four
   institutions, however, that "host" W3C: MIT (in Cambridge, MA, USA),
   ERCIM (in Sophia-Antipolis, France), Keio University (near Tokyo,
   Japan), and Beihang University (in Beijing, China).

   The W3C staff is distributed around the world, but there are
   concentrations of people in Cambridge, Massachusetts (USA),
   Sophia-Antipolis (France), and Tokyo (Japan). In addition, W3C is
   represented in 17 other regions of the world via representatives based
   at organizations. W3C calls these regional points of contact "W3C
   Offices."

How is W3C funded?

   W3C receives funds from:
     * W3C Member dues
     * Research grants and other sources of private and public funding
     * Individual donations of money and equipment

What is the difference between the Web and the Internet?

   From the definition in the Wikipedia: "The Internet is a global system
   of interconnected computer networks that interchange data by packet
   switching using the standardized Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP)."

   Thus, the Internet is a network of networks, defined by the TPC/IP
   standards.

   The Web, on the other hand, is defined in W3C's Architecture of the
   World Wide Web, Volume I as follows: "The World Wide Web (WWW, or
   simply Web) is an information space in which the items of interest,
   referred to as resources, are identified by global identifiers called
   Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI)."

   Thus, the Web is an information space. The first three specifications
   for Web technologies defined URLs, HTTP, and HTML.

What does it mean that Tim Berners-Lee invented the Web?

   Tim Berners-Lee wrote a proposal in 1989 for a system called the World
   Wide Web. He then wrote the first Web browser, server, and Web page. He
   wrote the first specifications for URLs, HTTP, and HTML.

W3C has a validation service. Does W3C approve all Web pages?

   No. W3C does provide a free service for validating Web pages against
   standard formats. Although validation is not mandatory on the Web, it
   is useful for improving the quality of pages.

What is the difference between an open standard and open source software?

   In general terms: open source refers to software, and open standards
   refer to documents (that may then be implemented by software). There is
   no single definition global for either term.

   Some elements of openness that apply to W3C standards include:
     * All standards are available publicly at no cost
     * W3C adopted a Patent Policy in 2004 with the stated goal of
       assuring "that Recommendations produced under this policy can be
       implemented on a Royalty-Free (RF) basis."
     * W3C Process requires that groups address public comments
     * All technical comments are handled on their merits, whether they
       are made by W3C Members or public.
     * W3C's process is vendor-neutral.
     * W3C's persistence policy seeks to ensure that standards will be
       available at the same URI, unchanged, indefinitely.

Does W3C design Web sites? Can you recommend a designer?

   W3C is not in the business of designing Web sites. Although we greatly
   appreciate that many designers promote standards-based Web design, at
   the current time for reasons of neutrality, we cannot officially
   recommend any particular designers.

How do I get started building (or requesting) a standards-compliant Web site?

   W3C provides a list of resources that provides an introduction to
   standards-based design.

Do you have more FAQs?

   Yes. These additional FAQs are maintained by various people in the
   community; some are more up-to-date than others.

                                XHTML Vocabulary

   This is a vocabulary collection utilized by XHTML Family modules and
   document types using XHTML Modularization, including XHTML Role and
   XHTML + RDFa as defined in rdfa-syntax.

   The XHTML specifications are developed by the W3C XHTML 2 Working Group
   as part of the W3C HTML Activity.

   For more information about XML, please refer to the Extensible Markup
   Language (XML) 1.0 specification.

   Version date: 2010-01-27
     __________________________________________________________________

1. Introduction

   XHTML Modularization [XHTMLMOD] permits the development of XHTML
   modules and XHTML family markup languages. These modules and markup
   languages may, in turn, define local vocabulary items for use as values
   of attributes. This document describes the items that are available in
   the default XHTML vocabulary space:
   http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml/vocab#.
