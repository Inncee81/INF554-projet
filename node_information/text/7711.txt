    Let’s not oppose climate policies and purchasing power! Lessons from
       the French climate transition Let’s not oppose climate policies and
       purchasing power! Lessons from the French climate transition
       Rising green taxes on gasoline initially sparked the “Yellow
       Jackets” movement in November 2018. The winter of discontent that
       came with the tax riots reminds us of the importance of reconciling
       protection of purchasing power with that of the climate. read more

    Drowning, not waving: the UK and Brexit Drowning, not waving: the UK
       and Brexit
       So far Mrs May has been able to hold her party together – there
       currently seems to be no desire for a leadership challenge from
       those dissatisfied with her proposals, and there is no readily
       apparent leader in waiting. A challenge may come later in the year,
       especially if the government is seen as making any further
       concessions to the EU. Meanwhile preparations for a No Deal outcome
       are under consideration. Thus, the British government is not quite
       drowning and is certainly not waving. But its boat is certainly
       unstable. read more

    Fiscal money is an illusion, not a solution Fiscal money is an
       illusion, not a solution
       In their recent Telos post, a group of Italian economists who name
       themselves the Group of Fiscal Money assert that Credit Tax
       Certificates, which are tax assets, would not increase the Italian
       government deficit and would even contribute to curtail the debt
       burden. I am not convinced by their argumentation. read more

    Fiscal money as a solution to Italian eurowoes Fiscal money as a
       solution to Italian eurowoes
       As fiscal rules constrain Italy’s ability to reflate demand by
       issuing debt, and with monetary policy being as accommodative as it
       gets, an alternative instrument is required. Fiscal Money provides
       such instrument. Our proposal is for government to issue
       transferable and negotiable bonds, which bearers may use for tax
       rebates two years after issuance. read more

       How to protect non-food products which are emblematic of a

       extension of both protected designation of origin (PDO) and
       protected geographical indication (PGI) system for non-agricultural
       products. What are the challenges? Is such a regulation adapted?

    Boris Johnson, tea bags and the complexity of law Boris Johnson, tea
       bags and the complexity of law
       Boris Johnson, in his plea for Brexit, develops the familiar theme
       of excess of niggling and stupid standards coming from Brussels.
       But the proliferation of legal texts is not to be blamed on the
       European Union. It reflects the tensions between conflicting
       aspirations of a complex society, the demand for ever greater
       security and the refusal of any hazard. read more

    Does France really need solar roads? Does France really need solar
       roads?
       Contrary to its neighbors and partly due to the low cost of its
       nuclear electricity, until recently France did not show much
       interest in solar energy. The country now seems to be catching up.
       Public policies are implemented, both to encourage households and
       to foster an industry which has not yet reached maturity. Only
       thing is, one can hardly make sense of some of these policies. read

    The case for a European data policy The case for a European data
       policy
       A consistent set of European standards could prove to be a lever
       for framing a digital industrial policy. In a legal framework where
       individuals come under high protection, the winners will be the
       enterprises who inspire enough confidence to obtain the users’
       consent to access and use their personal data. Trust, says Rachel
       Botsman, is the currency of the 21st Century. Maybe. But data is
       the commodity of the future, and those who can combine trust and
       valuable data can lead the race. It has just started. read more

    Is Asia afraid of China?
       At the 6th East Asian Summit in Bali on 19th November the Chinese
       Premier, Wen Jiabao, found himself the butt of almost universal
       criticism from the leaders of the ten-member Association of
       Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) both for Chinese territorial claims
       and recent provocative actions in the South China Sea. Supported by
       the United States as well as India, Australia and Japan, the ASEAN
       countries insisted on multilateral negotiations over these
       questions, while the Chinese remained firm on the principle of
       bilateral solutions in which they would have a distinct
       asymmetrical advantage. read more

    Strategic Games around Free Trade Agreements in the Asia-Pacific
       Strategic Games around Free Trade Agreements in the Asia-Pacific
       Barely a week after the G20 in Cannes, ten of the 20 leaders
       reconvened half way across the world in Honolulu as part of the
       annual summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum
       (APEC), together with other Pacific Rim leaders. APEC summits are
       usually quiet and polite affair. This time, however, APEC became
       the scene of great diplomatic games and one more match in the
       growing strategic rivalry between China and US. Indeed, the US
       decided to use APEC as platform for strategic reengagement into
       Asia and balancing China’s growing dominance. This game may well be
       the one with the most significance for the future of the world
       economy. read more

    Can Technocratic Government be Democratic? Can Technocratic Government
       be Democratic?
       The resignations of Papandreou in Greece and Berlusconi in Italy,
       replaced by technocratic governments, have raised questions about
       the democracy of technocracy. These questions only gain in
       intensity when we add the EU Commission’s increasing powers of
       surveillance of member states’ national budgets, let alone those of
       the Troika (IMF, European Central Bank, and EU Commission) when it
       comes to eurozone member states that have had recourse to loan
       bailouts (Greece) or to the European Financial Stability Facility
       (EFSF). The answers to such questions are mixed. Berlusconi's
       replacement with a technocratic government—precipitated primarily
       by global market pressures—may actually be a sign of democracy at
       work. Papandreou's replacement—precipitated by the pressures of the
       eurozone powers and Papandreou’s own ill-advised gamble on ‘direct
       democracy’—depends upon how things play themselves out. As for the
       technocratic governance of the EU, this is where the democracy
       deficit may be greatest. read more

    The New Everyday The New Everyday
       Much of what I have previously written in this website suggests a
       powerful, albeit mostly implicit, motif. The profusion of
       technological information that is characteristic of our age is
       rapidly moving beyond the borders of social and economic
       institutions in which it was originally spawned in the form of
       filing, indexing and data processing. It increasingly infiltrates
       and ultimately colonizes everyday living. The relevant developments
       are certainly associated with the massive involvement of the
       internet in social life but they have further been reinforced by
       growing bandwidth, media convergence and social networking. They
       have, of late, been given a new push by the the rapid diffusion of
       a battery of potent portable and connectible digital devices such
       as smartphones, digital cameras and tablet computers that are
       operating across the traditional semiotic borders of text, sound
       and image and the separate technological conventions to which
       reading, listening and viewing have traditionally belonged. read

    Africa, AIDS and governance Africa, AIDS and governance
       Sub-Saharan Africa is by far the world region most affected by
       AIDS. It is estimated, according to UNAIDS, 2.2 million people were
       newly infected with HIV / AIDS in 2008, bringing to 24.1 million
       people living with HIV / AIDS in the worst case. Because there
       seems to be a link between AIDS and poverty in Africa, and a link
       between poverty and bad institutions, the epidemic raises the
       question of the quality of institutions, and after all, it can
       appear as an incentive to improve institutions. read more

    The trouble with the European Stability Mechanism The trouble with the
       European Stability Mechanism
       The meeting of the European Council on 24-25 March focused on
       shoring up the battered Eurozone infrastructure through the
       European Stability Mechanism. This column argues that the mechanism
       is seriously flawed. It says it is unlikely to withstand the shock
       of a severe financial crisis and may even spread the damage to
       high-debt countries, while leaving the Eurozone in the grip of
       paralysing vetoes. (in French; English version available on VoxEU)

       When we look back on the Libyan intervention, will we think of it

    The Fog of Currency War The Fog of Currency War
       One way to expose the economic mumbo-jumbo that is applied to the
       Chinese exchange rate by otherwise respectable economists is to
       look at it from the perspective of Germany and international trade.
       China-bashers, who from stuttering economies lecture those who have
       presided over the biggest economic miracle that has occurred
       without thieving foreign lands or labour, like to focus on current
       account imbalances. A better measure of competitiveness would be
       the trade account. The current account includeshot money inflows
       that come under the exchange control restrictions and have
       ballooned since the China-bashers created the belief that the
       renimbi is a one-way appreciation bet. Chinas annual trade surplus
       with the world was $184.5bn at the end of 2010 or 3.6% of GDP. More
       than ten significant economies have a larger trade surplus as a
       percent of GDP than China. Natural-resource-poor Germany is the
       most interesting analogy and it has the largest 12-month trade
       surplus in dollar terms in the world: $205.4bn or 6.0% of GDP. (in
       French) read more

    Energy: Nabucco’s comeback Energy: Nabucco’s comeback
       Since its launching in 2002, the Nabucco pipeline project has had
       several lives. Many times it was given as death, but it finally
       managed to rise from its own ashes. Even though the
       Russian-Ukrainian gas crisis in 2006 transformed Nabucco into a top
       priority European project, in the last few years it advanced a
       little but backed up a lot, resulting in barely concealed mockery.
       This pattern is true and depicts Nabucco’s situation before the
       economic crisis. The latter, with its negative effects, brought a
       breath of fresh air for the European project and its proponents
       have used it rather wisely. The latest developments in Azerbaijan
       and Turkmenistan are encouraging with regard to the equation of
       supply sources. It seems that Nabucco is back. read more
