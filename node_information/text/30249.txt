Key Steps to build Transparency and Accountability in Zambia

   Hope Mubanga | 17th October 2013

Zambia 123.jpg

   Zambia

   On September 25-27, 2013, approximately 150 representatives from key
   stakeholders groups-government, civil society, media, private sector,
   academia, donors and regional and international organizations met in
   Lusaka, Zambia to reflect on the domestication of the African Platform
   on Access to Information (APAI) and to leverage regional developments
   to enhance the enactment of Access to Information laws in African
   countries. The meeting also highlighted Zambia’s journey to enact its
   proposed Freedom of Information Bill and provide Zambians an
   opportunity to reflect on the multi-sect oral application of access to
   information.

   For me, it was a conference worth attending especially since Zambia has
   been grappling with enacting ATI legislation for 20 years now,
   undecided on whether or not to enact this legislation.  It is not clear
   what the basis of this indecision is, but regardless one can simply
   state that every government that has come and gone  has been fearful of
    functioning in an open society,  reluctant to deter corruption  and
   allow for even the basic  of information being made available to common
   citizens to promote popular participation of its citizens and this has
   resulted in the creation of a governance environment that  remains
   highly closed and  supported by a well- functioning  legal framework
   that was designed to promote  a closed society and maintain  effective
   checks and balances on any process  that seeks to promote politics of
   transparency, accountability, inclusion and diversity.  Socially and
   culturally, the country is faced with a number of emerging issues, for
   example,  women living with HIV, sex workers and LGBT individuals
   remain excluded from HIV information, education, communication and
   treatment  and once again, the  legal framework and the social attitude
   is very effective in creating an enabling and discriminatory
   environment.

   The root cause of our country’s problems stem from our legal framework:
   a constitution that has failed to promote equity, tolerance, social
   accountability, transparency, accountability and one that discourages
   any participation of the majority of the people in determining how they
   want to be governed.  Yes, there is no right way of achieving democracy
   as democracy is a process but there should be a starting pointing that
   should allow societies to move towards one goal and direction. I have
   heard many say Africa needs to develop its own idea and meaning of
   development and not be driven by western agendas; this is so true and
   that is why Zambia needs to have an honest discussion as to what we
   want democracy to achieve for Zambia.  I strongly believe that
   democracy must grow from within, but for it to grow from  within, we as
   a society must agree on want we want to achieve from it as this is a
   key step in us moving forward to avoid confrontations on adapting our
   legal framework to suit the needs of our people.   It is about creating
   consensus on a starting point while taking into consideration the
   supply and demand side of democracy.  There is need for an honest
   discussion on what basic minimum provisions should be put in place to
   attain our common goal.

   I am happy that the Patriotic Front Government, through the Ministry of
   Foreign Affairs has expressed interest in being part of the Open
   Government Partnership multi-stakeholder process and that the current
   Minister of Information and Broadcasting, in his ministerial statement
   to Parliament on October 4th 2013 stated the PF government had agreed
   in principal to enact that ATI Bill and eluded to the fact that
   openness would build trust amongst government and citizens. However, I
   am still skeptical especially since Honorable Kapeya is accountable to
   the President of the Republic of Zambia and will act and respond to any
   pressure in the interest of the President, but at least a statement was
   made and it is now up to civil society and other actors to develop
   innovative ideas to drive the change that is needed.  I am also glad
   that the PF government has moved forward to revising the National
   Decentralization Policy 2013 but I do see a problem in the rational of
   the policy in that it does posses a challenge in itself to the
   citizenry in that citizens will only be able to exercise control over
   local affairs once the ATI bill is enacted.  Democratic accountability
   will not be strengthened by the review and implementation of
   developmental plans alone but through the creation of an inclusive
   democratic culture, open society and responsive government.  In order
   to enhance community participation both civil society and government
   need to promote community participation by first addressing  the
   issues of indifference to matters of local governance and jointly work
   together to inculcate an inclusive society and  move away from this
   ruthless and intolerant  governance environment.  In addition, we the
   people must stop being indifferent to matters of governance and begin
   to meet our civic obligations.

   I look forward to seeing civil society step up to the plate and enhance
   organizational credibility and legitimacy and embrace the fact that
   they too must be open to scrutiny. We must have an honest discussion as
   to what we want to achieve from Democracy and stop hiding behind
   tradition and religion. We need to promote a society that is tolerant
   and inclusive for all.

     * Testing the boundaries of OGP

Testing the boundaries of OGP

   Martin Tisne | 25th September 2014

   Are governments most likely to reform before joining an international
   initiative or once they have joined it?

   The answer to this question will go a long way towards explaining the
   impact of Open Government Partnership in the years to come. As I’ve
   discussed before, much of the premise of OGP is based on an incentive
   structure that encourages countries to race to the top once in the
   initiative.

   But once in, how do you stop countries from sliding back down all the
   while helping others to stretch?

   The EU is probably the most successful governance club in the world.
   The Copenhagen political criteria spell out how EU members should be
   democracies, abide by the rule of law, respect human rights and protect
   minorities. Even there (with many carrots at their disposal), the union
   has struggled to maintain the same level of ambition for new member
   states as it did in the heady early 2000s when countries were working
   hard to undertake the required steps to join.

   The more countries want to get in, the more efforts they will make to
   join, the more difficult it is to keep the pressure on once in. On one
   hand, OGP has always sought to incentivize a ‘race to the top’ between
   members. On the other hand, there has also always been much discussion
   on the steering committee as to the pros and cons of a stricter
   approach towards OGP members that restrict space for civil society or
   violate human rights on a large scale (and a concern within civil
   society that countries could use OGP to ‘open wash’, much like
   ‘greenwashing’ in the environmental sector).

   What are the implications for OGP? Three issues stand out:

   The OGP has developed a draft ‘rapid response policy’ to deal with
   situations where OGP members violate human rights on a large scale and
   impose restrictions on civil society. It may seem bureaucratic, but
   whether that policy is approved in New York this September and
   subsequently implemented will be a significant test for the
   Partnership.

   OGP should consider tightening its civil liberties eligibility
   criterion. OGP eligibility rests on four criteria – access to
   information, transparency of budgets, asset disclosure and civil
   liberties. The first three are based on specific indicators, but the
   latter is based on an aggregate indicator (the civil liberties
   sub-indicator of the Economist Intelligence Unit’s democracy index) and
   does not capture year on year trends. Changing this now with 64 members
   in the initiative will be challenging. However difficult, OGP should
   consider updating it.

   Is there a need for an OGP index? Much like in the aid sector where the
   Aid Transparency Index ranks countries against each other and thus acts
   as a boost for the implementation of the International Aid Transparency
   Initiative (IATI), or the Open Budget Survey in the fiscal transparency
   sector, OGP might benefit from an independent, third party ranking
   system (which could either be an aggregate index, a dashboard bringing
   together existing indices etc.).

   This should not obscure OGP’s central objective – how to ensure that
   open government reformers from all over the world meet, network,
   replicate successful reforms and scale their impact. But ensuring that
   high energy, low capacity countries progress upwards, whilst ensuring
   that low-performing countries do not dampen the energy of the rest of
   the group (e.g. using OGP to “open wash”) will likely be a significant
   test to OGP in the years to come.

DataBootcamp: un boost a las capacidades para trabajar con datos

   Daniel Villatoro | 27th October 2017

   En agosto, muchos miembros de la comunidad latinoamericana de datos
   abiertos nos reunimos en Costa Rica en el marco de Abrelatam y
   ConDatos. Aprovechando ese mix de talento, organizamos un espacio de
   entrenamiento de alto impacto para todos aquellos que querían mejorar
   sus habilidades: el DataBootcamp.

   En este espacio de intercambio y formación los asistentes pudieron
   elegir dos talleres de un menú que les permitía aprender sobre cuatro
   partes diferentes del proceso de datificación: la extracción, la
   limpieza, el análisis y la visualización.

   En el taller sobre limpieza de datos pude compartir con compañeros de
   toda la región que trabajan desde diversos ámbitos. Aprendiendo entre
   empresarios, periodistas, académicos, programadores y funcionarios de
   entidades públicas pudimos identificar cuáles son los errores más
   comunes para la estandarización de datos y las maneras más prácticas
   para resolver estos problemas. Revisamos funciones básicas de
   herramientas que nos ayudan en este proceso, como Excel y Open Refine,
   y platicamos sobre estrategias para hacer más ágiles nuestros procesos
   de trabajo.

   PlR-A]

   Así, la mañana del 22 de agosto transcurrió en un ambiente de
   aprendizaje y diálogo.

   Por la tarde, los participantes tuvimos la oportunidad de poner todas
   esas capacidades en acción. En un ambiente diseñado para incentivar el
   intercambio de propuestas, la innovación y la exploración de múltiples
   enfoques a un mismo conjunto de datos, todo a través de una actividad
   que llamamos Expedición de Datos.

   En esta ocasión, los asistentes formaron 10 grupos a los cuales se les
   hizo un mismo reto: elaborar un producto basado en un mismo set de
   datos. En esta hoja de cálculo, Oxfam recopiló 27 indicadores de
   fiscalidad y desarrollo en 21 países de la región durante 27 años.

   Fue muy emocionante ver cómo los integrantes de cada grupo aportaban su
   visión particular a un mismo tema.

   Durante dos horas de trabajo los equipos pudieron elaborar sus
   propuestas. Durante esa etapa, estuve junto con los demás talleristas
   revisando el trabajo de los participantes del entrenamiento y aportando
   sugerencias o soluciones. En esta fase pudimos ver en práctica el
   proceso que implica llevar a la materialización una idea.

   Al cierre del día todos los participantes nos juntamos para ver a
   nuestros compañeros exponer su trabajo.

   Entre las propuestas, vimos maneras creativas y no vistas antes de
   visualizar información —como un gráfico al que terminamos nombrando
   “cebolla”—,  apuestas por enfoques regionales —como un comparativo del
   gasto público social en Centroamérica—, comparaciones de datos sobre
   crisis latentes —como la migración hacia Estados Unidos— e intentos de
   encontrar correlaciones entre los indicadores de fiscalidad y los de
   desarrollo social.

   Todos estos prototipos tienen la oportunidad de crecer hasta
   convertirse en  investigaciones, productos informativos o modelos de
   análisis luego de una buena dosis de aportes de expertos y edición
   multidisciplinar, sin embargo, lo más importante de una Expedición de
   Datos es ensuciarse las manos. La experiencia de colaborar como equipo
   y el impulso para resolver el reto propuesto incentivan la curiosidad y
   nos ayudan a perder el miedo y obviar las excusas para no trabajar con
   datos. Es muy valioso experimentar con el proceso en maneras que la
   rutina diaria de trabajo o nuestra profesión no nos permite. De esta
   manera logramos salirnos de las cajas de pensamiento que nos mantienen
   sin innovar en la búsqueda de una mejor sociedad.

User centred methods for measuring the value of open data

   1st January 2015

   A project to identify metrics for assessing the quality of open data
   based on the needs of small voluntary sector organisations in the UK
   and India. For the purposes of the project we assumed the purpose of
   open data metrics is to determine the value of a group of open datasets
   to a defined community of users. We adopted a much more user-centred
   approach than most open data research using small structured workshops
   to identify users’ key problems and then working from those problems to
   understand how open data can help address them and the key attributes
   of the data if it is to be successful. We then piloted different
   metrics that might be used to measure the presence of those attributes.
   The result was six metrics that we assessed for validity, reliability,
   discrimination, transferability and comparability. This user-centred
   approach to open data research highlighted some fundamental issues with
   expanding the use of open data from its enthusiast base.

   A Citizen Engagement Breakthrough
   citizengage| 17th July 2018

   Crossposted from CitizENGAGE

   Nigeria’s Kaduna State needs better roads, schools, and hospitals. An
   estimated $95 billion is needed to build new infrastructure. By the
   government’s own admission, however, it has over-spent and
   under-delivered on infrastructure projects, which are notoriously
   vulnerable to corruption. To address this, the Kaduna government
   launched the “Eyes and Ears” project, enlisting citizens to monitor
   government infrastructure projects.

   “Eyes and Ears” calls on citizens to monitor government projects.
   Progress and problems in building infrastructure can be reported
   through several platforms: a smartphone app allowing photos of sites to
   be uploaded, text messaging, phone hotlines, and via social media
   platform Twitter. The information collected is organized and given to
   the relevant authorities for further action. A database has been
   established to blacklist contractors who aren’t getting the job done.

   Early results have been impressive. According to the government, money
   is flowing to projects more quickly, the quality of work has improved,
   and citizen participation has shot up. The World Bank has described
   “Eyes and Ears” as a breakthrough in citizen engagement. According to
   the Budget Commissioner, the government is getting “daily feedback on
   the quality or otherwise of our projects across the state.”
