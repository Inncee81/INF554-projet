   Credit: CC0 Public Domain A Japanese start-up developing "shooting
   stars on demand" says it will be ready to deliver the world's first
   artificial meteor shower in a spectacular show over Hiroshima in early
   2020.

   ALE, based in Tokyo, is in the final stages of developing two
   micro-satellites that will release tiny balls that glow brightly as
   they enter the atmosphere, simulating a meteor shower.

   The first satellite will hitch a ride into space on a rocket being
   launched by Japan's space agency by March 2019.

   The second will be launched in mid-2019 on a private-sector rocket.

   "We are targeting the whole world, as our stockpile of shooting stars
   will be in space and can be delivered across the world," ALE chief
   executive Lena Okajima told reporters on Wednesday.

   Each satellite will be able to carry 400 tiny balls whose chemical
   formula is a closely-guarded secret.

   Ejected from the satellite, the balls will glow as they plunge through
   the atmosphere.

   The 400 balls will be enough for 20-30 events, according to the
   company, and the satellites will be able to stay in space for around
   two years.

   The company is also exploring the possibility of using satellites
   already in space that are no longer operational to create "giant"
   shooting stars, officials said.

   "We are planning to push a used satellite into the atmosphere on a
   targeted orbit to create a giant artificial shooting star," ALE chief
   engineer Ko Kamachi, adding that the idea was still in the basic
   research phase.

   ALE's two satellites will start orbiting the Earth by February 2020,
   preparing for the world's first delivery of artificial shooting stars
   in spring 2020, over the western Japan city of Hiroshima.

   The satellites can be used separately or in tandem, and will be
   programmed to eject the balls at the right location, speed and
   direction to put on a show for viewers on the ground.

   Tinkering with the ingredients in the balls should mean that it is
   possible to change the colours they glow, offering the possibility of a
   multi-coloured flotilla of shooting stars.

   Each star is expected to shine for several seconds before being
   completely burned up—well before they fall low enough to pose any
   danger to anything on Earth.

   They would glow brightly enough to be seen even over the light-polluted
   metropolis of Tokyo.

   If all goes well, and the skies are clear, the 2020 event could be
   visible to millions of people, ALE said.

   Okajima said the company chose Hiroshima for its first display because
   of its good weather, landscape and cultural assets.

   ALE is working in collaboration with scientists and engineers at
   Japanese universities as well as local government officials and
   corporate sponsors.

   It has not disclosed the price for an artificial meteor but it may not
   come so cheap, with the company spending about $20 million for the
   development, production, launch and operation of the two satellites.

Fertilizer use responsible for increase in nitrous oxide in atmosphere

April 2, 2012
University of California - Berkeley

   Would you like to receive trending story notifications on your
   smartphone?

   University of California, Berkeley, chemists have found a smoking gun
   proving that increased fertilizer use over the past 50 years is
   responsible for a dramatic rise in atmospheric nitrous oxide, which is
   a major greenhouse gas contributing to global climate change.

   Climate scientists have assumed that the cause of the increased nitrous
   oxide was nitrogen-based fertilizer, which stimulates microbes in the
   soil to convert nitrogen to nitrous oxide at a faster rate than normal.

   The new study, reported in the April issue of the journal Nature
   Geoscience, uses nitrogen isotope data to identify the unmistakable
   fingerprint of fertilizer use in archived air samples from Antarctica
   and Tasmania.

   "Our study is the first to show empirically from the data at hand alone
   that the nitrogen isotope ratio in the atmosphere and how it has
   changed over time is a fingerprint of fertilizer use," said study
   leader Kristie Boering, a UC Berkeley professor of chemistry and of
   earth and planetary science.

   "We are not vilifying fertilizer. We can't just stop using fertilizer,"
   she added. "But we hope this study will contribute to changes in
   fertilizer use and agricultural practices that will help to mitigate
   the release of nitrous oxide into the atmosphere."

   Since the year 1750, nitrous oxide levels have risen 20 percent  from
   below 270 parts per billion (ppb) to more than 320 ppb. After carbon
   dioxide and methane, nitrous oxide (N2O) is the most potent greenhouse
   gas, trapping heat and contributing to global warming. It also destroys
   stratospheric ozone, which protects the planet from harmful ultraviolet
   rays.

   Not surprisingly, a steep ramp-up in atmospheric nitrous oxide
   coincided with the green revolution that increased dramatically in the
   1960s, when inexpensive, synthetic fertilizer and other developments
   boosted food production worldwide, feeding a burgeoning global
   population.

   Tracking the origin of nitrous oxide in the atmosphere, however, is
   difficult because a molecule from a fertilized field looks identical to
   one from a natural forest or the ocean if you only measure total
   concentration. But a quirk of microbial metabolism affects the isotope
   ratio of the nitrogen the N2O microbes give off, producing a telltale
   fingerprint that can be detected with sensitive techniques.

   Archived air from Cape Grim

   Boering and her colleagues, including former UC Berkeley graduate
   students Sunyoung Park and Phillip Croteau, obtained air samples from
   Antarctic ice, called firn air, dating from 1940 to 2005, and from an
   atmospheric monitoring station at Cape Grim, Tasmania, which has
   archived air back to 1978.

   Analysis of N2O levels in the Cape Grim air samples revealed a seasonal
   cycle, which has been known before. But isotopic measurements by a very
   sensitive isotope ratio mass spectrometer also displayed a seasonal
   cycle, which had not been observed before. At Cape Grim, the isotopes
   show that the seasonal cycle is due both to the circulation of air
   returning from the stratosphere, where N2O is destroyed after an
   average lifetime of 120 years, and to seasonal changes in the ocean,
   most likely upwelling that releases more N2O at some times of year than
   at others.

   "The fact that the isotopic composition of N2O shows a coherent signal
   in space and time is exciting, because now you have a way to
   differentiate agricultural N2O from natural ocean N2O from Amazon
   forest emissions from N2O returning from the stratosphere," Boering
   said. "In addition, you also now have a way to check whether your
   international neighbors are abiding by agreements they've made to
   mitigate N2O emissions. It is a tool that, ultimately, we can use to
   verify whether N2O emissions by agriculture or biofuel production are
   in line with what they say they are."

   Changes in fertilizer use can reduce N2O emissions

   Limiting nitrous oxide emissions could be part of a first step toward
   reducing all greenhouse gases and lessening global warming, Boering
   said, especially since immediately reducing global carbon dioxide
   emissions is proving difficult from a political standpoint. In
   particular, reducing nitrous oxide emissions can initially offset more
   than its fair share of greenhouse gas emissions overall, since N2O
   traps heat at a different wavelength than CO2 and clogs a "window" that
   allows Earth to cool off independent of CO2 levels.

   "On a pound for pound basis, it is really worthwhile to figure how to
   limit our emissions of N2O and methane," she said. "Limiting N2O
   emissions can buy us a little more time in figuring out how to reduce
   CO2 emissions."

   One approach, for example, is to time fertilizer application to avoid
   rain, because wet and happy soil microbes can produce sudden bursts of
   nitrous oxide. Changes in the way fields are tilled, when they are
   fertilized and how much is used can reduce N2O production.

   Boering's studies, which involve analyzing the isotopic fingerprints of
   nitrous oxide from different sources, could help farmers determine
   which strategies are most effective. It could also help assess the
   potential negative impacts of growing crops for biofuels, since some
   feedstocks may require fertilizer that will generate N2O that offsets
   their carbon neutrality.

   "This new evidence of the budget of nitrous oxide allows us to better
   predict its future changes and therefore its impacts on climate and
   stratospheric ozone depletion - for different scenarios of fertilizer
   use in support of rising populations and increased production for
   bio-energy," said coauthor David Etheridge of the Centre for Australian
   Weather and Climate Research in Aspendale, Victoria.

   Finding the fingerprint of fertilized microbes

   Boering was able to trace the source of N2O because bacteria in a
   nitrogen rich environment, such as a freshly fertilized field, prefer
   to incorporate nitrogen-14 (14N), the most common isotope, instead of
   nitrogen-15 (15N).

   "Microbes on a spa weekend can afford to discriminate against
   nitrogen-15, so the fingerprint of N2O from a fertilized field is a
   greater proportion of nitrogen-14," Boering said. "Our study is the
   first to show empirically from the data at hand alone that the nitrogen
   isotope ratio in the atmosphere and how it has changed over time is a
   fingerprint of fertilizer use."

   Just as telling is the isotope ratio of the central nitrogen atom in
   the N-N-O molecule. By measuring the nitrogen isotope ratio overall,
   the isotope ratio in the central nitrogen atom, and contrasting these
   with the oxygen-18/oxygen-16 isotope ratio, which has not changed over
   the past 65 years, they were able to paint a consistent picture
   pointing at fertilizer as the major source of increased atmospheric N2O
   .

   The isotope ratios also revealed that fertilizer use has caused a shift
   in the way soil microbes produce N2O. The relative output of bacteria
   that produce N2O by nitrification grew from 13 to 23 percent worldwide,
   while the relative output of bacteria that produce N2O by
   denitrification  typically in the absence of oxygen  dropped from 87
   to 77 percent. Although the numbers themselves are uncertain, these are
   the first numerical estimates of these global trends over time, made
   possible by the unique archived air dataset of this study.
