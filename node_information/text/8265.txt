It's time to end extreme inequality

   Extreme inequality is hurting us all - damaging economic growth,
   fuelling crime, and squandering the hopes and ambitions of billions who
   are trapped at the bottom with no way out.
   Despite her young age, Komal from India, has already faced a lifetime
   of discrimination. But she’s determined to use sport to show her
   strength, and is literally fighting for gender equality.

Violence against women and girls: enough is enough

   Did you know that at least one in three women will experience some form
   of violence during their lifetime? It is one of the most widespread
   violations of human rights and has long-term devastating effects. We
   can change this: join us and say ‘Enough’!

Refugee and migrant crisis

   Millions of people are being forced from their homes, risking
   everything to escape conflict, disaster, poverty or hunger. From those
   fleeing the war in Syria or climate change-induced droughts, to those
   stranded in inadequate conditions in Europe, you can help us give
   life-saving support to refugees in the countries where they need it
   most.

Crisis in Syria

   The crisis in Syria continues to cause tremendous human suffering to
   people both inside and outside the country. The conflict is driving the
   largest refugee crisis in the world. Nearly 12 million people – 2 in 3
   Syrians – are still dependent on humanitarian aid. They need your help.

From Mozambique: a cry out to leaders at the Climate Summit

   As world leaders gather in New York this week for the Climate Action
   Summit, Oxfam partner Jose Mucote decided to come all the way from
   Mozambique to share his experiences as a first responder to the
   devastating Cyclone Idai earlier this year, a cyclone that is a true
   witness of a climate crisis we can no longer ignore.

Women defenders of the land and the environment: silenced voices

   Women defenders are at the forefront in the peaceful fight against
   climate change, for the preservation of ecosystems and the protection
   of human rights. They face terror campaigns that seek to silence their
   voices on a daily basis. Meanwhile, governments and companies do not
   act to guarantee their safety and address the root causes of these
   aggressions.

Crisis in Yemen: help us save lives

   Almost four years of devastating conflict have plunged Yemen into one
   of the world's gravest humanitarian crises. The country is on the brink
   of famine and is also now suffering the largest ever outbreak of
   cholera since records began. We are delivering emergency aid but we
   urgently need your help to do more.

From Mozambique: a cry out to leaders at the Climate Summit

   As world leaders gather in New York this week for the Climate Action
   Summit, Oxfam partner Jose Mucote decided to come all the way from
   Mozambique to share his experiences as a first responder to the
   devastating Cyclone Idai earlier this year, a cyclone that is a true
   witness of a climate crisis we can no longer ignore.

Women defenders of the land and the environment: silenced voices

   Women defenders are at the forefront in the peaceful fight against
   climate change, for the preservation of ecosystems and the protection
   of human rights. They face terror campaigns that seek to silence their
   voices on a daily basis. Meanwhile, governments and companies do not
   act to guarantee their safety and address the root causes of these
   aggressions.

Crisis in Yemen: help us save lives

   urgently need your help to do more.

It's time to end extreme inequality

   Extreme inequality is hurting us all - damaging economic growth,
   fuelling crime, and squandering the hopes and ambitions of billions who
   are trapped at the bottom with no way out.

Violence against women and girls: enough is enough

   Did you know that at least one in three women will experience some form
   of violence during their lifetime? It is one of the most widespread
   violations of human rights and has long-term devastating effects. We

It's time to end extreme inequality

   Extreme inequality is hurting us all - damaging economic growth,
   fuelling crime, and squandering the hopes and ambitions of billions who
   are trapped at the bottom with no way out.
   Despite her young age, Komal from India, has already faced a lifetime
   of discrimination. But she’s determined to use sport to show her
   strength, and is literally fighting for gender equality.

Violence against women and girls: enough is enough

   Did you know that at least one in three women will experience some form
   of violence during their lifetime? It is one of the most widespread
   violations of human rights and has long-term devastating effects. We
   can change this: join us and say ‘Enough’!

Refugee and migrant crisis

   Millions of people are being forced from their homes, risking
   everything to escape conflict, disaster, poverty or hunger. From those
   fleeing the war in Syria or climate change-induced droughts, to those
   stranded in inadequate conditions in Europe, you can help us give
   life-saving support to refugees in the countries where they need it
   most.

Crisis in Syria

   The crisis in Syria continues to cause tremendous human suffering to
   people both inside and outside the country. The conflict is driving the
   largest refugee crisis in the world. Nearly 12 million people – 2 in 3
   Syrians – are still dependent on humanitarian aid. They need your help.

Privacy Notice

   Oxfam International respects your privacy and is committed to
   protecting your personal data. This Notice explains when and how we
   collect your personal data when you use our website, and the rights you
   have over your own information.

   This Notice applies to the website of Stichting Oxfam International,
   however, when you use this site you may be directed to the website of
   other members of the Oxfam confederation or links to third party
   websites or applications. These websites will have their own Privacy
   Notices, which you should also look at.

   If you have any questions in relation to this Notice or would like to
   exercise your rights under it, please contact:

   FAO Data Protection Officer for Oxfam International
   Oxfam Ireland, 2nd Floor, Portview House, Thorncastle Street, Ringsend,
   Dublin 4.
   Email address for queries: info@oxfam.org

Information about who we are

   Stichting Oxfam International is a Dutch Foundation (registration no.
   41159611) with a registered Office at PO Box 30919, 2500 GX The Hague,
   The Netherlands. Further information, and details of our registration
   with data protection supervisory authorities are detailed below.

How our website works

   When you visit our website, we collect data on your location. This
   allows us to direct you to the website of the Oxfam Affiliate in your
   geographic region if this is necessary to perform any of your requested
   actions.

   We also use cookies on our website to collect standard internet log-on
   information and details of visitor behavior patterns (e.g. to find out
   the number of visitors to different parts of the site). This enables us
   to analyse and improve the content of our site and the navigation
   experience of users. We do not use this information to attempt to find
   out the identities of those visiting our website. Some cookies on our
   site also permit third parties to analyse visitor behavior to display
   advertising. These parties also do not use this information to attempt
   to find out the identities of individuals. For full details of the
   cookies used on our website, see our Cookies Notice. You can disable or
   delete some or all cookies in your browser setting, although this may
   affect some parts of the site’s functionality.

The data we collect about you

   There are a number of areas on our website where you may provide
   personal data to Oxfam International, including when you:
     * register for Oxfam email updates
     * sign an Oxfam petition
     * make a donation to Oxfam
     * register to be involved in our campaigns

   The information we collect will depend on the nature of your action but
   may include name, email address, telephone number, country and language
   preference. Where you make a donation through our website, we do not
   collect your financial information but direct you to a payment provider
   to process your donation and forward it on to Oxfam’s global fund. Our
   payment provider is certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield.

   When you provide your information to us, we will only use the
   information for the purposes for which it is provided, for any
   compatible purposes and to fulfil our legal or regulatory obligations
   unless you have agreed for your data to be used for other purposes.

When will we send you marketing communications?

   We will only contact you for marketing purposes (for example keep you
   up to date on our work based on your previous responses to our
   campaigns, or let you know of ways in which you can support that work)
   where we have your consent.

   At each place that you provide your personal data on our website, there
   is an opportunity for you to express your preferences in relation to
   marketing communications from us. Where you provide your consent to
   such communications, you can withdraw consent or change your
   preferences at any time by clicking the unsubscribe button on any
   marketing communication or by sending an email to info@oxfam.org
   expressing your preferences.

   We will generally treat any marketing consent you give us as lasting
   for 5 years, as we have found our supporters may get involved with
   different campaigns at different points over this period of time. We
   never sell or share your information with entities outside Oxfam for
   their marketing purposes.

Links to other Affiliate websites

   For some actions that you may like to take when visiting our website,
   you will be redirected to the website of an Oxfam affiliate in your
   geographic region. In these cases, that entity will collect your data
   rather than Oxfam International, and you should look at their Privacy
   Notice to understand how they will use your data, and your rights. This
   includes where:
     * you make a donation in a region where there is an Oxfam affiliate;
     * register to participate in Trailwalker;
     * apply for employment or to be a shop or festival volunteer; or
     * register to participate in a local campaign.

Who might we share your information with

   We may share your information with other members of the Oxfam
   confederation. We may also share your information with third parties
   who process data on our behalf, but only where we place obligations on
   them in relation to the security of the data and require them to use
   the data only as we instruct.

International transfers of data

   In some cases, we may transfer your personal data to members of the
   Oxfam confederation and third-party service providers who are located
   outside your jurisdiction.

   If you are in the European Union, and your personal data is transferred
   to an Oxfam Affiliate or third-party service provider outside the
   European Economic Area (EEA), this will occur under a safeguard
   mechanism recognized by the European Commission as providing adequate
   protection for your personal data.  Transfers to Oxfam Affiliates will
   occur under the EC’s model data protection clauses.  You may ask to see
   a copy of these clauses.

   Transfers of your data to other third parties outside the EEA, or to
   third parties outside any other jurisdiction in which you are located,
   will occur in accordance with local data protection laws.

Your data and social media

   This section refers to the ability for you to like, re-tweet, share,
   etc. Oxfam International content on social media platforms, such as
   Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. Additionally, when using our
   website, you can link through to such social media sites. When you do
   this, depending on your privacy settings, these networks will adjust
   their marketing to show you more Oxfam and/or Oxfam-type content.  To
   change your settings on these services, please refer to their privacy
   notices, which will tell you how to do this.

Children’s data

   Our website is not intended for use by children and we do not knowingly
   collect data on children.

Oxfam and social media

   Many social media sites provide, or permit, tools that aggregate and
   highlight content that appears on their site. Oxfam International uses
   such tools to analyse and assess the success of Oxfam campaigns and
   communications, the level of interest in issues Oxfam cares about, and
   the level of social media activity resulting from media stories about
   Oxfam or Oxfam/NGO activities. We use the native reporting tools of the
   social media networks, but may also use third-party tools.  Oxfam uses
   such tools to respond directly to other users’ queries and comments
   related to Oxfam.

How do we protect your data

   We ensure that there are appropriate technical controls in place to
   protect your personal details. For example, our online forms are always
   encrypted and our network is protected and routinely monitored.

   We undertake regular reviews of who has access to information that we
   hold to ensure that your information is only accessible by
   appropriately trained staff, volunteers and contractors.

   Where we use external companies to collect or process personal data on
   our behalf, we put a contract in place that sets out our expectations
   and requirements in relation to security of the data they access or
   process.  These organizations - referred to as "Data Processors" also
   have legal liability for the way in which your data is used, providing
   you with additional protection.

How long do we keep your data

   We will only retain the data you provide to us through our website for
   as long as required by applicable laws or as is necessary for the
   purpose for which it was collected and in accordance with any consents
   provided. We will delete personal data at the end of this period unless
   we wish to use it for statistical purposes, in which case we will
   anonymise it, such that you could never be re-identified with it.

Your rights

   You have the right to request details of the information we hold about
   you. If you would like a copy of some or all of your personal
   information, please make a request to our Data Protection officer at
   the details provided below. We will provide this information to you
   without charge, unless requests are manifestly unfounded, repetitive or
   excessive, in which case we are entitled to charge an administration
   fee.

   You also have a right to have inaccurate information we hold about you
   rectified or removed and a right, in some circumstances, to restrict or
   object to us processing your information, or to seek erasure of your
   data. If you believe we are not respecting your rights, you are
   entitled to make a complaint to a relevant supervisory authority.

   The legal basis on which we hold and use your data will vary depending
   on the activity involved. In some cases, we might hold the data because
   it is needed to fulfil a contract or meet our legal obligations (i.e. a
   donation), in others because it is in Oxfam’s legitimate interest to do
   so, and in others, because you have consented to this use. We note that
   the legal basis on which we process your data will influence your
   specific rights.

Changes to this notice

   We may make changes to this notice from time to time. We will always
   detail, at the end of this notice, the date it was last updated and you
   should check back from time to time.

It's time to end extreme inequality

   Extreme inequality is hurting us all - damaging economic growth,
   fuelling crime, and squandering the hopes and ambitions of billions who
   are trapped at the bottom with no way out.
   Despite her young age, Komal from India, has already faced a lifetime
   of discrimination. But she’s determined to use sport to show her
   strength, and is literally fighting for gender equality.

Violence against women and girls: enough is enough

   Did you know that at least one in three women will experience some form
   of violence during their lifetime? It is one of the most widespread
   violations of human rights and has long-term devastating effects. We
   can change this: join us and say ‘Enough’!

Refugee and migrant crisis

   Millions of people are being forced from their homes, risking
   everything to escape conflict, disaster, poverty or hunger. From those
   fleeing the war in Syria or climate change-induced droughts, to those
   stranded in inadequate conditions in Europe, you can help us give
   life-saving support to refugees in the countries where they need it
   most.

Crisis in Syria

   The crisis in Syria continues to cause tremendous human suffering to
   people both inside and outside the country. The conflict is driving the
   largest refugee crisis in the world. Nearly 12 million people – 2 in 3
   Syrians – are still dependent on humanitarian aid. They need your help.

From Mozambique: a cry out to leaders at the Climate Summit

   As world leaders gather in New York this week for the Climate Action
   Summit, Oxfam partner Jose Mucote decided to come all the way from
   Mozambique to share his experiences as a first responder to the
   devastating Cyclone Idai earlier this year, a cyclone that is a true
   witness of a climate crisis we can no longer ignore.

Women defenders of the land and the environment: silenced voices

   Women defenders are at the forefront in the peaceful fight against
   climate change, for the preservation of ecosystems and the protection
   of human rights. They face terror campaigns that seek to silence their
   voices on a daily basis. Meanwhile, governments and companies do not

Crisis in Yemen: help us save lives

   of the world's gravest humanitarian crises. The country is on the brink
   of famine and is also now suffering the largest ever outbreak of
   cholera since records began. We are delivering emergency aid but we
   urgently need your help to do more.

It's time to end extreme inequality

   Extreme inequality is hurting us all - damaging economic growth,
   fuelling crime, and squandering the hopes and ambitions of billions who
   are trapped at the bottom with no way out.

   of discrimination. But she’s determined to use sport to show her
   strength, and is literally fighting for gender equality.

Violence against women and girls: enough is enough

   Did you know that at least one in three women will experience some form
   of violence during their lifetime? It is one of the most widespread
   violations of human rights and has long-term devastating effects. We
   can change this: join us and say ‘Enough’!

Refugee and migrant crisis

Crisis in Syria

   The crisis in Syria continues to cause tremendous human suffering to
   people both inside and outside the country. The conflict is driving the
   largest refugee crisis in the world. Nearly 12 million people – 2 in 3

From Mozambique: a cry out to leaders at the Climate Summit

   As world leaders gather in New York this week for the Climate Action
   Summit, Oxfam partner Jose Mucote decided to come all the way from
   Mozambique to share his experiences as a first responder to the
   devastating Cyclone Idai earlier this year, a cyclone that is a true
   witness of a climate crisis we can no longer ignore.

Women defenders of the land and the environment: silenced voices

   Women defenders are at the forefront in the peaceful fight against
   climate change, for the preservation of ecosystems and the protection
   of human rights. They face terror campaigns that seek to silence their
   voices on a daily basis. Meanwhile, governments and companies do not
   act to guarantee their safety and address the root causes of these
   aggressions.

It's time to end extreme inequality

   Extreme inequality is hurting us all - damaging economic growth,
   fuelling crime, and squandering the hopes and ambitions of billions who
   are trapped at the bottom with no way out.
   Despite her young age, Komal from India, has already faced a lifetime
   of discrimination. But she’s determined to use sport to show her
   strength, and is literally fighting for gender equality.

Violence against women and girls: enough is enough

   of violence during their lifetime? It is one of the most widespread
   violations of human rights and has long-term devastating effects. We

Refugee and migrant crisis

   Millions of people are being forced from their homes, risking
   everything to escape conflict, disaster, poverty or hunger. From those
   fleeing the war in Syria or climate change-induced droughts, to those
   stranded in inadequate conditions in Europe, you can help us give
   life-saving support to refugees in the countries where they need it
   most.

Crisis in Syria

   The crisis in Syria continues to cause tremendous human suffering to
   people both inside and outside the country. The conflict is driving the
   largest refugee crisis in the world. Nearly 12 million people – 2 in 3
   Syrians – are still dependent on humanitarian aid. They need your help.

From Mozambique: a cry out to leaders at the Climate Summit

   As world leaders gather in New York this week for the Climate Action
   Summit, Oxfam partner Jose Mucote decided to come all the way from
   Mozambique to share his experiences as a first responder to the
   devastating Cyclone Idai earlier this year, a cyclone that is a true
   witness of a climate crisis we can no longer ignore.

Women defenders of the land and the environment: silenced voices

   Women defenders are at the forefront in the peaceful fight against
   climate change, for the preservation of ecosystems and the protection
   of human rights. They face terror campaigns that seek to silence their
   voices on a daily basis. Meanwhile, governments and companies do not
   act to guarantee their safety and address the root causes of these
   aggressions.

Crisis in Yemen: help us save lives

   Almost four years of devastating conflict have plunged Yemen into one
   of the world's gravest humanitarian crises. The country is on the brink
   of famine and is also now suffering the largest ever outbreak of
   cholera since records began. We are delivering emergency aid but we
   urgently need your help to do more.

Refugee and migrant crisis

   Millions of people are being forced from their homes, risking
   everything to escape conflict, disaster, poverty or hunger. From those
   fleeing the war in Syria or climate change-induced droughts, to those
   stranded in inadequate conditions in Europe, you can help us give
   life-saving support to refugees in the countries where they need it
   most.

Crisis in Syria

   The crisis in Syria continues to cause tremendous human suffering to
   people both inside and outside the country. The conflict is driving the
   largest refugee crisis in the world. Nearly 12 million people – 2 in 3
   Syrians – are still dependent on humanitarian aid. They need your help.

Privacy Notice

   Oxfam International respects your privacy and is committed to
   protecting your personal data. This Notice explains when and how we
   collect your personal data when you use our website, and the rights you
   have over your own information.

   This Notice applies to the website of Stichting Oxfam International,
   however, when you use this site you may be directed to the website of
   other members of the Oxfam confederation or links to third party
   websites or applications. These websites will have their own Privacy
   Notices, which you should also look at.

   If you have any questions in relation to this Notice or would like to
   exercise your rights under it, please contact:

   FAO Data Protection Officer for Oxfam International
   Oxfam Ireland, 2nd Floor, Portview House, Thorncastle Street, Ringsend,
   Dublin 4.
   Email address for queries: info@oxfam.org

Information about who we are

   Stichting Oxfam International is a Dutch Foundation (registration no.
   41159611) with a registered Office at PO Box 30919, 2500 GX The Hague,
   The Netherlands. Further information, and details of our registration
   with data protection supervisory authorities are detailed below.

How our website works

   When you visit our website, we collect data on your location. This
   allows us to direct you to the website of the Oxfam Affiliate in your
   geographic region if this is necessary to perform any of your requested
   actions.

   We also use cookies on our website to collect standard internet log-on
   information and details of visitor behavior patterns (e.g. to find out
   the number of visitors to different parts of the site). This enables us
   to analyse and improve the content of our site and the navigation
   experience of users. We do not use this information to attempt to find
   out the identities of those visiting our website. Some cookies on our
   site also permit third parties to analyse visitor behavior to display
   advertising. These parties also do not use this information to attempt
   to find out the identities of individuals. For full details of the
   cookies used on our website, see our Cookies Notice. You can disable or
   delete some or all cookies in your browser setting, although this may
   affect some parts of the site’s functionality.

The data we collect about you

   There are a number of areas on our website where you may provide
   personal data to Oxfam International, including when you:
     * register for Oxfam email updates
     * sign an Oxfam petition
     * make a donation to Oxfam
     * register to be involved in our campaigns

   The information we collect will depend on the nature of your action but
   may include name, email address, telephone number, country and language
   preference. Where you make a donation through our website, we do not
   collect your financial information but direct you to a payment provider
   to process your donation and forward it on to Oxfam’s global fund. Our
   payment provider is certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield.

   When you provide your information to us, we will only use the
   information for the purposes for which it is provided, for any
   compatible purposes and to fulfil our legal or regulatory obligations
   unless you have agreed for your data to be used for other purposes.

When will we send you marketing communications?

   We will only contact you for marketing purposes (for example keep you
   up to date on our work based on your previous responses to our
   campaigns, or let you know of ways in which you can support that work)
   where we have your consent.

   At each place that you provide your personal data on our website, there
   is an opportunity for you to express your preferences in relation to
   marketing communications from us. Where you provide your consent to
   such communications, you can withdraw consent or change your
   preferences at any time by clicking the unsubscribe button on any
   marketing communication or by sending an email to info@oxfam.org
   expressing your preferences.

   We will generally treat any marketing consent you give us as lasting
   for 5 years, as we have found our supporters may get involved with
   different campaigns at different points over this period of time. We
   never sell or share your information with entities outside Oxfam for
   their marketing purposes.

Links to other Affiliate websites

   For some actions that you may like to take when visiting our website,
   you will be redirected to the website of an Oxfam affiliate in your
   geographic region. In these cases, that entity will collect your data
   rather than Oxfam International, and you should look at their Privacy
   Notice to understand how they will use your data, and your rights. This
   includes where:
     * you make a donation in a region where there is an Oxfam affiliate;
     * register to participate in Trailwalker;
     * apply for employment or to be a shop or festival volunteer; or
     * register to participate in a local campaign.

Who might we share your information with

   We may share your information with other members of the Oxfam
   confederation. We may also share your information with third parties
   who process data on our behalf, but only where we place obligations on
   them in relation to the security of the data and require them to use
   the data only as we instruct.

International transfers of data

   In some cases, we may transfer your personal data to members of the
   Oxfam confederation and third-party service providers who are located
   outside your jurisdiction.

   If you are in the European Union, and your personal data is transferred
   to an Oxfam Affiliate or third-party service provider outside the
   European Economic Area (EEA), this will occur under a safeguard
   mechanism recognized by the European Commission as providing adequate
   protection for your personal data.  Transfers to Oxfam Affiliates will
   occur under the EC’s model data protection clauses.  You may ask to see
   a copy of these clauses.

   Transfers of your data to other third parties outside the EEA, or to
   third parties outside any other jurisdiction in which you are located,
   will occur in accordance with local data protection laws.

Your data and social media

   This section refers to the ability for you to like, re-tweet, share,
   etc. Oxfam International content on social media platforms, such as
   Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. Additionally, when using our
   website, you can link through to such social media sites. When you do
   this, depending on your privacy settings, these networks will adjust
   their marketing to show you more Oxfam and/or Oxfam-type content.  To
   change your settings on these services, please refer to their privacy
   notices, which will tell you how to do this.

Children’s data

   Our website is not intended for use by children and we do not knowingly
   collect data on children.

Oxfam and social media

   Many social media sites provide, or permit, tools that aggregate and
   highlight content that appears on their site. Oxfam International uses
   such tools to analyse and assess the success of Oxfam campaigns and
   communications, the level of interest in issues Oxfam cares about, and
   the level of social media activity resulting from media stories about
   Oxfam or Oxfam/NGO activities. We use the native reporting tools of the
   social media networks, but may also use third-party tools.  Oxfam uses
   such tools to respond directly to other users’ queries and comments
   related to Oxfam.

How do we protect your data

   We ensure that there are appropriate technical controls in place to
   protect your personal details. For example, our online forms are always
   encrypted and our network is protected and routinely monitored.

   We undertake regular reviews of who has access to information that we
   hold to ensure that your information is only accessible by
   appropriately trained staff, volunteers and contractors.

   Where we use external companies to collect or process personal data on
   our behalf, we put a contract in place that sets out our expectations
   and requirements in relation to security of the data they access or
   process.  These organizations - referred to as "Data Processors" also
   have legal liability for the way in which your data is used, providing
   you with additional protection.

How long do we keep your data

   We will only retain the data you provide to us through our website for
   as long as required by applicable laws or as is necessary for the
   purpose for which it was collected and in accordance with any consents
   provided. We will delete personal data at the end of this period unless
   we wish to use it for statistical purposes, in which case we will
   anonymise it, such that you could never be re-identified with it.

Your rights

   You have the right to request details of the information we hold about
   you. If you would like a copy of some or all of your personal
   information, please make a request to our Data Protection officer at
   the details provided below. We will provide this information to you
   without charge, unless requests are manifestly unfounded, repetitive or
   excessive, in which case we are entitled to charge an administration
   fee.

   You also have a right to have inaccurate information we hold about you
   rectified or removed and a right, in some circumstances, to restrict or
   object to us processing your information, or to seek erasure of your
   data. If you believe we are not respecting your rights, you are
   entitled to make a complaint to a relevant supervisory authority.

   The legal basis on which we hold and use your data will vary depending
   on the activity involved. In some cases, we might hold the data because
   it is needed to fulfil a contract or meet our legal obligations (i.e. a
   donation), in others because it is in Oxfam’s legitimate interest to do
   so, and in others, because you have consented to this use. We note that
   the legal basis on which we process your data will influence your
   specific rights.

Changes to this notice

   We may make changes to this notice from time to time. We will always
   detail, at the end of this notice, the date it was last updated and you
   should check back from time to time.

It's time to end extreme inequality

   Extreme inequality is hurting us all - damaging economic growth,
   fuelling crime, and squandering the hopes and ambitions of billions who
   are trapped at the bottom with no way out.
   Despite her young age, Komal from India, has already faced a lifetime
   of discrimination. But she’s determined to use sport to show her
   strength, and is literally fighting for gender equality.

Violence against women and girls: enough is enough

   Did you know that at least one in three women will experience some form
   of violence during their lifetime? It is one of the most widespread
   violations of human rights and has long-term devastating effects. We
   can change this: join us and say ‘Enough’!

Refugee and migrant crisis

   Millions of people are being forced from their homes, risking
   everything to escape conflict, disaster, poverty or hunger. From those
   fleeing the war in Syria or climate change-induced droughts, to those
   stranded in inadequate conditions in Europe, you can help us give
   life-saving support to refugees in the countries where they need it
   most.

Crisis in Syria

   The crisis in Syria continues to cause tremendous human suffering to
   people both inside and outside the country. The conflict is driving the
   largest refugee crisis in the world. Nearly 12 million people – 2 in 3
   Syrians – are still dependent on humanitarian aid. They need your help.
