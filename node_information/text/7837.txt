       value-neutral editorial policy governed by openness. The more
       worldviews and rhetorical styles on the site, the better. We want
       to tell all sides of the story and generate dialogue.

FAQ

   What is Thought Catalog?

   Thought Catalog is an online magazine with over 30 million monthly
   readers. The site serves as a platform for emerging and seasoned
   writers to voice their thoughts and to flourish creatively. Thought
   Catalog was founded in 2010, and its original mission still stands
   today: to empower creative people by helping them realize their
   artistic visions on their own terms.

   Who owns Thought Catalog?

   Thought Catalog is independently owned and operated by The Thought &
   Expression Company. We are one of the few major media companies in
   existence today that is still independent. Chris Lavergne is the
   founder and publisher of Thought Catalog.  For more information about
   our company, visit our corporate website at www.thought.is.

   How do I report offensive or illegal content on Thought Catalog?

   At the top of every article next to the writer byline is a flag. Click
   the flag and identify the problem with the article and it will be
   reported for review.

   unnamed


   Do you allow writers to publish under pseudonyms?

   Anonymity is a double-edged sword. It can make us less accountable and
   less empathetic to the impact of our actions. By freeing us from
   consequences, it can bring out the worst in us. But anonymity can also
   be liberating. Ventriloquism can expand our creative horizons by
   allowing us to experiment with different identities or provide a safe
   space to talk about sensitive issues. At Thought Catalog, we accept
   pseudonyms and anonymous submissions but discourage hiding behind a
   mask merely for the sake of hiding.

   How do I contribute to Thought Catalog?

   You can submit to Thought Catalog through the general submissions form
   here. Alternatively, you can submit directly to your favorite Thought
   Catalog writer through the link on their author page.

   Thought Catalog has also a freelance program for independent writers.
   If you have a freelance proposal for Thought Catalog, please direct
   it to pitches@thoughtcatalog.com.

   How do I contact the writer of a certain article?

   Head over to their profile page. If the writer wants to be contacted by
   email, you will see a contact button. If they don’t have the contact
   button enabled, your best bet is to leave a comment on their article
   or reach out to them on social media.

   Are you hiring?

   Writing: Thought Catalog employs many full-time staff writers, most of
   who were recruited after contributing regularly to Thought Catalog. We
   typically look for writers that have a proven track record on Thought
   Catalog platform.

                    For The Women Who Take Up Too Much Space

   I have always felt like I take up too much space. It’s partially my
   body — I have always been curvier than many of my peers — but it seems
   like more than that. Maybe it’s my emotions, which are oftentimes too
   big, or my voice, which seems to echo off the walls of every room I
   enter. My laugh could wake up an entire neighborhood. Even to myself, I
   sometimes feel inescapable.

   It took time and a lot of awkward incidents for me to finally decide
   that I was, indeed, far too big for the space people expected me to
   occupy. I was clumsy — I bumped into people and knocked into side
   tables, totally unaware of where I stood in relation to the rest of the
   world. When I went out with my friends, people around us seemed too
   aware of my presence. (“I don’t know if you noticed, but the people at
   the table next to us were listening to you the whole time,” my friends
   would tell me far too often.) Sometimes I’d hear what people said about
   me when they didn’t think I could hear them and have to pretend it
   didn’t hurt me, like I didn’t know, like I didn’t even care — like it
   didn’t make me resent myself just a little more than before.

   But sometimes it was a whole lot clearer than that. It really hit me
   until I was sitting in the living room with my college roommate,
   listening to her complain about a classmate she couldn’t stand as we
   sipped from glasses of wine. “I’m so over her,” she complained. “She’s
   just… a lot.”

   “What is that supposed to mean?” I asked, mostly out of curiosity. For
   all of her complaining, I couldn’t understand what irked my roommate so
   much.

   She paused, then shrugged. “I don’t know. She’s a bit like you, I
   guess.” She waved a hand in my direction as if to capture the very
   essence of me. “You know, too much sometimes.”

   Though it was maybe the first time I’d heard it in words, the concept
   itself wasn’t new to me. It was something I’d always suspected. Too
   much, too much, too much. And yet somehow, the way she said it made me
   feel like I wasn’t enough. I was simultaneously too big and too small.
   If there was a happy medium, I had no idea how to find it. All I knew
   was that I hated how her words made me feel.

   And so I tried so hard to change. If I was always at an 11, I tried to
   tamp myself down to a four. I held my tongue when all I wanted to do
   was scream. When I felt bombarded with an emotion, I did whatever I
   could to suppress it, to push it down so far that maybe I wouldn’t feel
   it anymore. I’d suck in my stomach and hunch my shoulders and cross my
   legs as tightly as I could and try to shrink myself, to disappear if I
   could. I did everything I could to appear less than what I was — and
   for some reason, that’s genuinely what I wanted to be.

   Wasn’t it?

   But here’s the thing about trying to change yourself to fit other
   people’s standards: You’ll never feel like yourself. Something will
   always be missing, even if you aren’t sure what it is. And as I tried
   so hard to fit into what I felt was acceptable, I realized I became
   less and less sure of who I was and more and more likely to let people
   treat me like I was inferior to them. I let them talk down to me
   because I believed the things they said. I let them get away with
   shitty things because, when I thought about it hard enough, it felt
   justified. Perhaps the worst part of all was that I thought I deserved
   it. I’d tricked myself into believing I was too little, too small.

   The truth is, deep down, I know that I am a lot. But what it took me so
   long to realize was that isn’t necessarily a bad thing.

   Because when I let myself be exactly who I am, I become a woman who
   knows what she wants. I become a woman who feels big things, who allows
   herself to experience every emotion she encounters. I become a woman
   who doesn’t care that I don’t look like an actress or a model or the
   barista from my regular coffee shop that I’ve always been a little
   jealous of. I become a woman with so many thoughts and dreams and
   opinions, who’s unafraid to articulate them. I become a woman who
   reclaims every inch of space she had taken away from her and every
   piece that she willingly gave away.

   And god, how I love that woman so wholeheartedly.

   It was a long journey to embrace her again, filled with insecurities
   and doubts and a lot of self-hatred. It took a long time to stop caring
   about what everyone around me thought, because for the longest time,
   that was the only thing that mattered to me. But when the thing you let
   guide your life becomes the thing that stops you from fully
   experiencing it, maybe it’s time to recognize that it’s not as
   important as you always thought it was.

   I don’t talk to my old roommate anymore. There’s a lot of people who I
   don’t talk to anymore, people who preferred an altered version of
   myself over who I really am. People who I decided to reclaim my space
   from, finally and permanently, even when they weren’t ready to give it
   back. Of course it was hard, and of course it was sad, but mostly it
   was freeing. I have never felt so fully alive.

   I think the most important thing for a woman who takes up too much
   space to remember is that there are people in the world who will love
   you for exactly that. There are people in the world who will feel
   enveloped by who you are. There are people in the world who will relish
   every inch of you and never ask you to shrink yourself or become less
   than, who will never want you to be anyone else.

   I see that now in the people in my life. I see it when I make a bad
   joke and my friend can only smirk and shake his head. “God,” he said
   once, “you’re too much.” But this time, it didn’t feel like an insult.
   There was so much affection in those words, so much warmth, as if to
   say, “And that is exactly the right amount.” And I know now that it is.

   Maybe I’ll always be too much. Maybe I’ll always take up too much
   space. But maybe it has always belonged to me.

   barista from my regular coffee shop that I’ve always been a little
   jealous of. I become a woman with so many thoughts and dreams and
   opinions, who’s unafraid to articulate them. I become a woman who
   reclaims every inch of space she had taken away from her and every
   piece that she willingly gave away.

   And god, how I love that woman so wholeheartedly.

   It was a long journey to embrace her again, filled with insecurities
   and doubts and a lot of self-hatred. It took a long time to stop caring
   about what everyone around me thought, because for the longest time,
   that was the only thing that mattered to me. But when the thing you let
   guide your life becomes the thing that stops you from fully
   experiencing it, maybe it’s time to recognize that it’s not as
   important as you always thought it was.

   I don’t talk to my old roommate anymore. There’s a lot of people who I
   don’t talk to anymore, people who preferred an altered version of
   myself over who I really am. People who I decided to reclaim my space
   from, finally and permanently, even when they weren’t ready to give it
   back. Of course it was hard, and of course it was sad, but mostly it
   was freeing. I have never felt so fully alive.

   I think the most important thing for a woman who takes up too much
   space to remember is that there are people in the world who will love
   you for exactly that. There are people in the world who will feel
   enveloped by who you are. There are people in the world who will relish
   every inch of you and never ask you to shrink yourself or become less
   than, who will never want you to be anyone else.

   I see that now in the people in my life. I see it when I make a bad
   joke and my friend can only smirk and shake his head. “God,” he said
   once, “you’re too much.” But this time, it didn’t feel like an insult.
   There was so much affection in those words, so much warmth, as if to
   say, “And that is exactly the right amount.” And I know now that it is.

   Maybe I’ll always be too much. Maybe I’ll always take up too much
   space. But maybe it has always belonged to me. TC mark

   This is me letting you go

This is me letting you go

   If there’s one thing we all need to stop doing, it’s waiting around for
   someone else to show up and change our lives. Just be the person you’ve
   been waiting for.

   At the end of the day, you have two choices in love – one is to accept
   someone just as they are and the other is to walk away.

   We owe it to ourselves to live the greatest life that we’re capable of
   living, even if that means that we have to be alone for a very long
   time.

   “Everyone could use a book like this at some point in their life.” –

FAQ

   What is Thought Catalog?

   Thought Catalog is an online magazine with over 30 million monthly
   readers. The site serves as a platform for emerging and seasoned
   writers to voice their thoughts and to flourish creatively. Thought
   Catalog was founded in 2010, and its original mission still stands
   today: to empower creative people by helping them realize their
   artistic visions on their own terms.

   Who owns Thought Catalog?

   Thought Catalog is independently owned and operated by The Thought &
   Expression Company. We are one of the few major media companies in
   existence today that is still independent. Chris Lavergne is the
   founder and publisher of Thought Catalog.  For more information about
   our company, visit our corporate website at www.thought.is.

   How do I report offensive or illegal content on Thought Catalog?

   At the top of every article next to the writer byline is a flag. Click
   the flag and identify the problem with the article and it will be
   reported for review.

   unnamed


   Do you allow writers to publish under pseudonyms?

   Anonymity is a double-edged sword. It can make us less accountable and
   less empathetic to the impact of our actions. By freeing us from
   consequences, it can bring out the worst in us. But anonymity can also
   be liberating. Ventriloquism can expand our creative horizons by
   allowing us to experiment with different identities or provide a safe
   space to talk about sensitive issues. At Thought Catalog, we accept
   pseudonyms and anonymous submissions but discourage hiding behind a
   mask merely for the sake of hiding.

   How do I contribute to Thought Catalog?

   You can submit to Thought Catalog through the general submissions form
   here. Alternatively, you can submit directly to your favorite Thought
   Catalog writer through the link on their author page.

   Thought Catalog has also a freelance program for independent writers.
   If you have a freelance proposal for Thought Catalog, please direct
   it to pitches@thoughtcatalog.com.

   How do I contact the writer of a certain article?

   Head over to their profile page. If the writer wants to be contacted by
   email, you will see a contact button. If they don’t have the contact
   button enabled, your best bet is to leave a comment on their article
   or reach out to them on social media.

   Are you hiring?

   who were recruited after contributing regularly to Thought Catalog. We
   typically look for writers that have a proven track record on Thought
   Catalog platform.

                    For The Women Who Take Up Too Much Space

   September 25th, 7:16pm September 25th, 7:18pm


    Callie ByrnesCallie is a professional Thought Catalog blogger by day
    and an amateur Tumblr blogger by night.

  Self-Improvement

   IFRAME:
   https://www.facebook.com/adnw_request?placement=202394996809196_2023965
   56809040&adtype=banner300x250

   I have always felt like I take up too much space. It’s partially my
   body — I have always been curvier than many of my peers — but it seems
   like more than that. Maybe it’s my emotions, which are oftentimes too
   big, or my voice, which seems to echo off the walls of every room I
   enter. My laugh could wake up an entire neighborhood. Even to myself, I
   sometimes feel inescapable.

   It took time and a lot of awkward incidents for me to finally decide
   that I was, indeed, far too big for the space people expected me to
   occupy. I was clumsy — I bumped into people and knocked into side
   tables, totally unaware of where I stood in relation to the rest of the
   world. When I went out with my friends, people around us seemed too
   aware of my presence. (“I don’t know if you noticed, but the people at
   the table next to us were listening to you the whole time,” my friends
   would tell me far too often.) Sometimes I’d hear what people said about
   me when they didn’t think I could hear them and have to pretend it
   didn’t hurt me, like I didn’t know, like I didn’t even care — like it
   didn’t make me resent myself just a little more than before.

   But sometimes it was a whole lot clearer than that. It really hit me
   until I was sitting in the living room with my college roommate,
   listening to her complain about a classmate she couldn’t stand as we
   sipped from glasses of wine. “I’m so over her,” she complained. “She’s
   just… a lot.”

   “What is that supposed to mean?” I asked, mostly out of curiosity. For
   all of her complaining, I couldn’t understand what irked my roommate so
   much.

   She paused, then shrugged. “I don’t know. She’s a bit like you, I
   guess.” She waved a hand in my direction as if to capture the very
   essence of me. “You know, too much sometimes.”

   Though it was maybe the first time I’d heard it in words, the concept
   itself wasn’t new to me. It was something I’d always suspected. Too
   much, too much, too much. And yet somehow, the way she said it made me
   feel like I wasn’t enough. I was simultaneously too big and too small.
   If there was a happy medium, I had no idea how to find it. All I knew
   was that I hated how her words made me feel.

   And so I tried so hard to change. If I was always at an 11, I tried to
   tamp myself down to a four. I held my tongue when all I wanted to do
   was scream. When I felt bombarded with an emotion, I did whatever I
   could to suppress it, to push it down so far that maybe I wouldn’t feel
   it anymore. I’d suck in my stomach and hunch my shoulders and cross my
   legs as tightly as I could and try to shrink myself, to disappear if I
   could. I did everything I could to appear less than what I was — and
   for some reason, that’s genuinely what I wanted to be.

   Wasn’t it?

   But here’s the thing about trying to change yourself to fit other
   people’s standards: You’ll never feel like yourself. Something will
   always be missing, even if you aren’t sure what it is. And as I tried
   so hard to fit into what I felt was acceptable, I realized I became
   less and less sure of who I was and more and more likely to let people
   treat me like I was inferior to them. I let them talk down to me
   because I believed the things they said. I let them get away with
   shitty things because, when I thought about it hard enough, it felt
   justified. Perhaps the worst part of all was that I thought I deserved
   it. I’d tricked myself into believing I was too little, too small.

   The truth is, deep down, I know that I am a lot. But what it took me so
   long to realize was that isn’t necessarily a bad thing.

   Because when I let myself be exactly who I am, I become a woman who
   knows what she wants. I become a woman who feels big things, who allows
   herself to experience every emotion she encounters. I become a woman
   who doesn’t care that I don’t look like an actress or a model or the
   barista from my regular coffee shop that I’ve always been a little
   jealous of. I become a woman with so many thoughts and dreams and
   opinions, who’s unafraid to articulate them. I become a woman who
   reclaims every inch of space she had taken away from her and every
   piece that she willingly gave away.

   And god, how I love that woman so wholeheartedly.

   It was a long journey to embrace her again, filled with insecurities
   and doubts and a lot of self-hatred. It took a long time to stop caring
   about what everyone around me thought, because for the longest time,
   that was the only thing that mattered to me. But when the thing you let
   guide your life becomes the thing that stops you from fully
   experiencing it, maybe it’s time to recognize that it’s not as
   important as you always thought it was.

   I don’t talk to my old roommate anymore. There’s a lot of people who I
   don’t talk to anymore, people who preferred an altered version of
   myself over who I really am. People who I decided to reclaim my space
   from, finally and permanently, even when they weren’t ready to give it
   back. Of course it was hard, and of course it was sad, but mostly it
   was freeing. I have never felt so fully alive.

   I think the most important thing for a woman who takes up too much
   space to remember is that there are people in the world who will love
   you for exactly that. There are people in the world who will feel
   enveloped by who you are. There are people in the world who will relish
   every inch of you and never ask you to shrink yourself or become less
   than, who will never want you to be anyone else.

   I see that now in the people in my life. I see it when I make a bad
   joke and my friend can only smirk and shake his head. “God,” he said
   once, “you’re too much.” But this time, it didn’t feel like an insult.
   There was so much affection in those words, so much warmth, as if to
   say, “And that is exactly the right amount.” And I know now that it is.

   Maybe I’ll always be too much. Maybe I’ll always take up too much
   space. But maybe it has always belonged to me.

   I have always felt like I take up too much space. It’s partially my
   body — I have always been curvier than many of my peers — but it seems
   like more than that. Maybe it’s my emotions, which are oftentimes too
   big, or my voice, which seems to echo off the walls of every room I
   enter. My laugh could wake up an entire neighborhood. Even to myself, I
   sometimes feel inescapable.

   It took time and a lot of awkward incidents for me to finally decide
   that I was, indeed, far too big for the space people expected me to
   occupy. I was clumsy — I bumped into people and knocked into side
   tables, totally unaware of where I stood in relation to the rest of the
   world. When I went out with my friends, people around us seemed too
   aware of my presence. (“I don’t know if you noticed, but the people at
   the table next to us were listening to you the whole time,” my friends
   would tell me far too often.) Sometimes I’d hear what people said about
   me when they didn’t think I could hear them and have to pretend it
   didn’t hurt me, like I didn’t know, like I didn’t even care — like it
   didn’t make me resent myself just a little more than before.

   But sometimes it was a whole lot clearer than that. It really hit me
   until I was sitting in the living room with my college roommate,
   listening to her complain about a classmate she couldn’t stand as we
   sipped from glasses of wine. “I’m so over her,” she complained. “She’s
   just… a lot.”

   “What is that supposed to mean?” I asked, mostly out of curiosity. For
   all of her complaining, I couldn’t understand what irked my roommate so
   much.

   She paused, then shrugged. “I don’t know. She’s a bit like you, I
   guess.” She waved a hand in my direction as if to capture the very
   essence of me. “You know, too much sometimes.”

   Though it was maybe the first time I’d heard it in words, the concept
   itself wasn’t new to me. It was something I’d always suspected. Too
   much, too much, too much. And yet somehow, the way she said it made me
   feel like I wasn’t enough. I was simultaneously too big and too small.
   If there was a happy medium, I had no idea how to find it. All I knew
   was that I hated how her words made me feel.

   And so I tried so hard to change. If I was always at an 11, I tried to
   tamp myself down to a four. I held my tongue when all I wanted to do
   was scream. When I felt bombarded with an emotion, I did whatever I
   could to suppress it, to push it down so far that maybe I wouldn’t feel
   it anymore. I’d suck in my stomach and hunch my shoulders and cross my
   legs as tightly as I could and try to shrink myself, to disappear if I
   could. I did everything I could to appear less than what I was — and
   for some reason, that’s genuinely what I wanted to be.

   Wasn’t it?

   But here’s the thing about trying to change yourself to fit other
   people’s standards: You’ll never feel like yourself. Something will
   always be missing, even if you aren’t sure what it is. And as I tried
   so hard to fit into what I felt was acceptable, I realized I became
   less and less sure of who I was and more and more likely to let people
   treat me like I was inferior to them. I let them talk down to me
   because I believed the things they said. I let them get away with
   shitty things because, when I thought about it hard enough, it felt
   justified. Perhaps the worst part of all was that I thought I deserved
   it. I’d tricked myself into believing I was too little, too small.

   The truth is, deep down, I know that I am a lot. But what it took me so
   long to realize was that isn’t necessarily a bad thing.

   Because when I let myself be exactly who I am, I become a woman who
   knows what she wants. I become a woman who feels big things, who allows
   herself to experience every emotion she encounters. I become a woman
   who doesn’t care that I don’t look like an actress or a model or the
   barista from my regular coffee shop that I’ve always been a little
   jealous of. I become a woman with so many thoughts and dreams and
   opinions, who’s unafraid to articulate them. I become a woman who
   reclaims every inch of space she had taken away from her and every
   piece that she willingly gave away.

   And god, how I love that woman so wholeheartedly.

   It was a long journey to embrace her again, filled with insecurities
   and doubts and a lot of self-hatred. It took a long time to stop caring
   about what everyone around me thought, because for the longest time,
   that was the only thing that mattered to me. But when the thing you let
   guide your life becomes the thing that stops you from fully
   experiencing it, maybe it’s time to recognize that it’s not as
   important as you always thought it was.

   I don’t talk to my old roommate anymore. There’s a lot of people who I
   don’t talk to anymore, people who preferred an altered version of
   myself over who I really am. People who I decided to reclaim my space
   from, finally and permanently, even when they weren’t ready to give it
   back. Of course it was hard, and of course it was sad, but mostly it
   was freeing. I have never felt so fully alive.

   I think the most important thing for a woman who takes up too much
   space to remember is that there are people in the world who will love
   you for exactly that. There are people in the world who will feel
   enveloped by who you are. There are people in the world who will relish
   every inch of you and never ask you to shrink yourself or become less
   than, who will never want you to be anyone else.

   I see that now in the people in my life. I see it when I make a bad
   joke and my friend can only smirk and shake his head. “God,” he said
   once, “you’re too much.” But this time, it didn’t feel like an insult.
   There was so much affection in those words, so much warmth, as if to
   say, “And that is exactly the right amount.” And I know now that it is.

   Maybe I’ll always be too much. Maybe I’ll always take up too much
   space. But maybe it has always belonged to me. TC mark

   This is me letting you go

This is me letting you go

   If there’s one thing we all need to stop doing, it’s waiting around for
   someone else to show up and change our lives. Just be the person you’ve
   been waiting for.

   At the end of the day, you have two choices in love – one is to accept
   someone just as they are and the other is to walk away.

   We owe it to ourselves to live the greatest life that we’re capable of
   living, even if that means that we have to be alone for a very long
   time.

   “Everyone could use a book like this at some point in their life.” –
