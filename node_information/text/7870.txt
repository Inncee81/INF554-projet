   Check out the facts in our infographic

   Parliament is working on new measures to cut food waste in the EU by
   50%. Our infographic shows which sectors and countries waste the most
   food.

   Some 88 million tonnes of food are wasted in the EU every year,
   equivalent to 173 kilos per person. Not only is this a waste or
   resources, it also contributes to climate change. Parliament is working
   on new measures to cut food waste in the EU by 50%. Check out our
   infographic to find out  which sectors and countries waste the most
   food and read what is being done at EU level and what you can do
   yourself.

   Food is lost and wasted along the whole supply chain from farms to
   processing and manufacturing to shops, restaurants and at home. However
   most of the food in the EU is wasted by households with 53% and
   processing with 19%.

   Consumers are often unaware of the issue or its causes. According to a
   Eurobarometer survey,  date markings on food products is poorly
   understood, even though nearly six out 10 Europeans say they always
   check “best before” and “use by” labels.


   Why food waste is a problem

   Food waste does not only mean that valuable and often scarce resources
   such as water, soil, and energy are being lost, it also contributes to
   climate change. According to the UN's Food and Agricultural
   Organization (FAO), food waste has a global carbon footprint of about
   8% of all global greenhouse gas emissions caused by humans. For every
   kilo of food produced, 4.5 kilos of CO2 are released into the
   atmosphere.

   There is also the ethical aspect: FAO says about 793 million people in
   the world are malnourished. According to Eurostat, 55 million people
   (9.6% of the EU's population), were unable to afford a quality meal
   every second day in 2014,.

   What Parliament is doing


   On 16 May, MEPs adopted a report by Croatian S&D member Biljana Borzan,
   which proposes a set of measures to reduce food waste in the EU by 30%
   by 2025 and by 50% by 2030 compared to the 2014 baseline. This
   objective was already set out in the waste legislation package  adopted
   in March.

   “The European Union, as one of the richest and most prosperous
   communities in the world, has a moral and political obligation to
   reduce huge quantities of food wasted every year,” said Borzan before
   the committee vote in April.

   The report also includes several proposals to reduce food waste such as
   facilitating food donations.  The report calls on the European
   Commission to propose a change in the current VAT directive to
   explicitly authorise tax exemptions for food donations. Donations
   reduce food waste while helping people in need at the same time.

   In addition the report lists solutions to end the confusion about “best
   before” and “use by” labelling on food products.


   Six things you could do to minimise food waste
     * Compile shopping lists
     * Check the dates and be aware of the meaning of date labelling
     * Store food in accordance with the instructions on the packaging
     * Put new food at the back of your fridge and cupboards
     * Use up leftovers
     * Freeze

   MEPs propose to limit the share of waste to be landfilled to 5%. © AP
   Images/European Union-EP

   The share of waste to be recycled would rise to 70% by 2030, from 44%
   today, under draft legislation adopted on Tuesday. MEPs also want the
   “waste package” plans to limit the share of landfilling, which has a
   big environmental impact, to 5% and to deliver a 50% reduction in food
   waste by 2030. Parliament will now negotiate with Council of Ministers.

   Statistics for 2014 suggest that 44% of all municipal waste in the EU
   is recycled or composted. This compares to just 31% in 2004, and by
   2020 EU member states should be recycling or composting over 50% of
   waste.

   “Today, Parliament by a very large majority has showed that it believes
   in the transition towards a circular economy. We decided to restore the
   ambitious recycling and landfill targets in line with what the
   Commission had originally proposed in 2014 said lead MEP Simona Bonafè
   (S&D, IT).

   "Demand for raw materials by the world economy could increase by a
   further 50% in the next 15 years. In order to reverse this trend, we
   must adopt a circular development model which keeps materials and their
   value in circulation, the only solution able to keep together
   sustainability with economic growth" she said.

   "Re-use, recycling and recovery are becoming the key words around which
   a new paradigm needs to be built to promote sustainability, innovation
   and competitiveness, so that waste will cease to be a problem and
   become a resource" she added.”

   Waste and packaging waste

   By 2030, at least 70% by weight of so-called municipal waste (from
   households and businesses) should be recycled or prepared for re-use,
   (i.e. checked, cleaned or repaired), say MEPs. The European Commission
   proposed 65%.

   For packaging materials, such as paper and cardboard, plastics, glass,
   metal and wood, MEPs propose an 80% target for 2030, with interim 2025
   targets for each material.

   Landfilling

   The draft law limits the share of municipal waste to be landfilled to
   10% by 2030. MEPs propose reducing this to 5%albeit with a possible
   five-year extension, under certain conditions, for member states which
   landfilled more than 65% of their municipal waste in 2013.

   Food waste

   Food waste in the EU is estimated at some 89 million tonnes, or 180 kg
   per capita per year. MEPs advocate an EU food waste reduction target of
   30% by 2025 and 50% by 2030, compared to 2014. They also propose a
   similar target for marine litter.

   Next steps

   The four reports adopted on Tuesday represent Parliament’s negotiating
   position, ahead of negotiations with Council of ministers, which yet
   has to adopt its own position.

   Note to editors


   In 2014, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden
   sent virtually no municipal waste to landfill, whereas Cyprus, Croatia,
   Greece, Latvia and Malta still landfill more than three quarters of
   their municipal waste.


   Although waste management in the EU has improved considerably in recent
   decades, almost a third of municipal waste is still landfilled and less
   than half is recycled or composted, with wide variations between member
   states.


   Improving waste management could deliver benefits for the environment,
   climate, human health and the economy. As part of a shift in EU policy
   towards a circular economy, the European Commission made four
   legislative proposals introducing new waste-management targets
   regarding reuse, recycling and landfilling.


   The proposals also strengthen EU provisions on waste prevention and
   extended producer responsibility, and streamline definitions, reporting
   obligations and calculation methods for targets.
