   FAME, the French Absorption spectroscopy beamline in Material and
   Environmental science, is dedicated to X-ray absorption spectroscopy.
   FAME covers a wide variety of scientific fields (materials science,
   biophysics, chemistry) but focuses mainly in geochemical sciences
   where, in most cases, the probed elements are highly diluted.

   FAME being a bending magnet beamline, the optical elements have been
   designed in order firstly to maximize the photon flux on the sample and
   secondly to optimize the beamline stability and reduce the
   non-statistical noise (Proux et al. Journal of Synchrotron Radiation 13
   (2006) 59-68). Moreover, for an optimal acquisition of XAS spectra on
   diluted elements, the intense x-ray beam on the sample needs to be
   associated with a highly sensitive detection system: fluorescence
   detection is achieved with a 30-element Canberra Ge solid state
   detector.

   Opened to users since 2002, the beamline offers several sample
   environments, either to improve the measurements (helium cryostat),
   either to carry out in-situ measurements (HP-HT vessel, gaseous cell),
   and can accept many other apparatus.
     __________________________________________________________________

Tracing titanium dioxide nanoparticles in the environment

     * News
     * Spotlight on Science

   The abundance of titanium dioxide nanoparticles in the environment
   originating from human activities could be a potential environmental
   problem. To identify and distinguish between titanium dioxide
   nanoparticles from natural and anthropogenic sources, synchrotron
   techniques were used to study the nanoparticles in sewage sludge and
   soil.

   Titanium dioxide nanoparticles are one of the most commonly produced
   nanomaterials worldwide. They are present in many consumer products,
   such as sunscreen and confectionery. After use, a large proportion of
   TiO[2] ends up in agricultural soils, through the application of sewage
   sludge. A prerequisite for risk assessment is to be able to distinguish
   this released TiO[2] from the elevated TiO[2] natural background, and
   therefore detect anthropogenic inputs. Furthermore, the current models
   of nanomaterial fluxes in environmental compartments have large
   uncertainties, therefore field monitoring is needed to be able to
   quantify actual anthropogenic inputs. Therefore, an evaluation of the
   differences in terms of composition and structure between natural and
   anthropogenic nanomaterials may provide clues to help interpret data on
   toxicity.

   In this study, the potential of physical techniques to distinguish
   natural versus anthropogenic particles has been investigated. Three
   matrices were compared: sewage sludge, agricultural soil that had never
   received sewage sludge, and sludge-amended soil. They were studied
   using micro and nano X-ray fluorescence and bulk and micro X-ray
   absorption spectroscopy at beamlines ID21 and ID16B, by X-ray
   diffraction at beamline BM25, and by transmission electron microscopy.

   The size distribution of TiO[2] particles was determined by image
   analysis of the Ti nanoXRF maps. This revealed that the soil and sludge
   have a similar size distribution, with a range of nano- and micro-scale
   particles. Bulk Ti K-edge XANES spectroscopy showed that the two major
   Ti species were the TiO[2] polymorphs anatase and rutile. In the
   sludge, there were roughly equal proportions of rutile and anatase.
   This information is important because rutile and anatase have different
   toxicities, and it is very difficult to know which polymorph is used in
   which type of product, and the global proportions of rutile and anatase
   released into the environment. Amorphous TiO[2] was also detected as a
   minor species in the soil and in the sludge by µXANES. The combination
   of µXRF and µXANES data showed that there was no relationship between
   the size of the aggregates and Ti speciation.

   Finally, the morphology of the crystals observed by electron microscopy
   and the status of TiO[2] particles within the organo-mineral aggregates
   proved to be relevant criteria to discriminate natural versus
   anthropogenic TiO[2]. In the sludge, smooth particles typical of TiO[2]
   pigments were evidenced (Figure 1c, 1f), whereas the soil contained
   rough and irregular TiO[2] particles. Moreover, TiO[2] particles in the
   sludge were present as weakly evolved aggregates, dominated by organic
   matter (Figure 1a-b and Figure 2), whereas in the soil they were
   intimately associated with organo-mineral assemblages forming the soil
   micro- and macroaggregates (Figure 1d-f and Figure 2), the building
   blocks of soils.
   TEM analyses and energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis of the TiO2
   particles present in sludge and soil.

   and soil (d–e). (f) Energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis of the zones
   highlighted in (c) and (e).

   Although TiO[2] phases are generally considered as very weakly soluble,
   they undergo weathering and transformations in acidic soils or in the
   rhizosphere [1]. Thus, the observed differences in particle morphology
   may attenuate over time due to the weathering of TiO[2] minerals.
   Likewise, even if it is slow (in the range of decades, although this
   has been debated), the formation of soil aggregates is a dynamic and
   continuous process, so the progressive incorporation of anthropogenic
   TiO[2] within soil organo-mineral assemblages is expected. It is likely
   that with time, engineered TiO[2] becomes indistinguishable from the
   natural background in soils.

   To conclude, the X-ray studies complemented microscopy methods
   providing chemical identification of the TiO[2] species and location of
   the nanoparticles within soil and sludge matrixes.

ESRF participates in France's newest excellency projects

     * News
     * General News

   21-01-2011

   On 20 January, the French government announced 52 projects for new
   infrastructures of scientific excellency, chosen from 336 proposals
   received in response to the "Equipex" Call. The ESRF is a partner in
   two winning projects.

   The 52 projects will obtain in total 340 million Euros funding, of
   which 4.2 million Euros are earmarked for the EcoX project, and 12
   million Euros for the ThomX project.

   EcoX, proposed by the University of Grenoble and CNRS, foresees the
   construction of a completely new beamline at the ESRF to study the
   behavior of a wide range of metallic elements in biological systems and
   nanomaterials. The electronic structure and chemical reactivity of
   metals and metalloids is a major topic of front line research into
   environmental issues, health and toxicity, chemical engineering, and
   production of sustainable energy.

   This project will in particular provide data on the presence of toxic
   heavy metals in the environment, and on their toxicity for humans.

   ThomX is a joint project by seven partners from industry and academia
   which include Synchrotron Soleil and the ESRF. Its objective is to
   develop a compact X-ray source with a highly brilliant, directional,
   monochromatic and tunable beam for applications in the medical sciences
   (imagery and therapy), in cultural heritage and industrial
   technologies.

   After development of a prototype, French company THALES will turn this
   source into a commercial product for hospitals and museums around the
   world.

   "The jurys' concern with this call for proposals was to select the
   projects that will enable France to make an important technological
   step forward", said Valérie Pécresse, French Minister for Research,
   when she unveiled the 52 winning projects. The ESRF is pleased to have
   been invited to contribute to this joint effort.

   Mercury is a potent neurotoxin present in our daily lives and our body
   can accumulate it over the years. Food consumption, such as fish and
   rice, is the most common source of mercury exposure. Mercury can be
   found in dental amalgams, compact fluorescence lamps, vaccines, drugs,
   and electronics or can be used in artisanal gold mining. Finding the
   source of mercury contamination in our bodies is crucial for treatment
   and forensic investigations, but at present knowledge of the molecular
   form of mercury in human tissues and fluids, which could indicate
   source, is limited. However, an international team from the CNRS, the
   Universities of Grenoble Alpes, Bordeaux and Franche-Comté, France, the
   ESRF, the European synchrotron in Grenoble, France and the University
   of Illinois at Chicago, US, has developed new analytical capabilities
   that allow the identification of chemical forms of mercury in human
   hair that trace exposure. These results are published in Environmental
   Science & Technology.

   Mercury contamination, a public health issue

   Mercury is considered by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as one of
   the top ten chemicals or groups of chemicals of major public health
   concern. Exposure to mercury – even small amounts – may cause serious
   health problems in the nervous, digestive and immune systems, and is
   particularly dangerous for very young children and development of the
   child in utero. Identifying the type of mercury contamination, the
   dose, and the period and duration of exposure could provide key
   indicators to treat mercury poisoning.


   New analytical capabilities to identify chemical forms of mercury in
   human hair

   Until today, depending on the suspected source of contamination,
   mercury intake has been monitored by measurement of mercury
   concentration in urine, blood, or scalp hair. These measurements help
   to diagnose the dose of poisoning and provide data for epidemiological
   studies, but provide incomplete information on the source of mercury
   exposure essential for treatment and forensic investigations.


   Fig1_Press release @A.Manceau.jpg (TOC_v4)

   Spectral signature of two chemical forms of mercury in hair, one
   originating from fish consumption and the other from removal of a
   dental amalgam. In the first case (fish), mercury is methylated and
   bonded to one cysteine sulfur and one amine group from hair proteins
   (mostly keratin). In the second (dental amalgam), mercury is bonded to
   two cysteine sulfurs and two amine groups from hair
   proteins. @A.Manceau


   “Although urinary mercury concentration is considered to be the most
   accurate and widely used biomarker for assessing chronic exposure to
   mercury vapour and divalent mercury, we showed that inorganic mercury
   from dental amalgams can be detected in hair with distinct
   intermolecular structure from that of methylmercury from fish
   consumption” says Jean-Paul Bourdineaud, Professor of environmental
   toxicology at the University of Bordeaux, France.

   “Epidemiological studies on mercury intake through fish consumption
   assume that hair concentration is an indicator of only this source. Our
   results show that this assumption may not always be true” says Kathryn
   Nagy, Professor of Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University
   of Illinois at Chicago.

   With an average growth rate of about 1 cm per month, hair can capture
   contamination events with high time resolution. The team of researchers
   developed new analytical capabilities that allowed them to identify
   chemical forms of mercury in human hair. Using new synchrotron
   instrumentation, they found that mercury can be linked to source of
   exposure by precise characterisation of its bonding environment.

   Experiments at the ESRF have shown, for example, that a mercury spike
   along a hair strand was correlated, in this particular case, with a
   specific unsafe removal of dental amalgam. The data provide signatures
   of mercury sources, distinguish exogenous vs. endogenous exposure to
   inorganic mercury, and indicate the timing to within 1 or 2 days of an
   exposure event.

   The technical challenges

   As straightforward as it may seem, the team had to deal with some
   technical challenges before managing to retrieve this information:
   structural characterisation is complicated by the low concentration of
   mercury typical of most of the general population’s hair (typically 0.1
   to 3 ng of mercury/mg hair), and the flexibility of the mercury bonding
   environment which exhibits diverse coordination arrangements with
   carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur atoms.

   "When we realized that the microscopic 2.5 ng mercury hot-spot had a
   specific molecular signature, we were amazed. Still, to preclude any
   ambiguity on its origin, we had to determine the form of mercury and
   how it was chemically bonded to the hair proteins. This took several
   months of intense data analysis and calculations" says Alain Manceau,
   Director of Research at the CNRS.

   (b) Longitudinal profile from an individual affected by extraction of a
   dental amalgam. The mercury spike records the contamination event. 1
   ppm = 1 ng/mg. @A.Manceau


   To address these challenges, the team used the high performance
   capabilities of the ESRF by exploiting the X-ray nanoprobe experimental
   station at ID16B, an ESRF nano-analysis beamline, and by constructing a
   high-luminosity X-ray crystal multi-analyser that fully takes advantage
   of the high-brilliance of the ESRF ID26 spectrometer beamline.

   As explained by Remi Tucoulou, scientist at ID16B, and Pieter Glatzel,
   scientist at ID26: “Such measurements on samples with very low metal
   concentrations require instruments that are extremely sensitive and at
   the same time provide very high resolution for chemical
   characterisation.”

   The multi-analyser was funded by the EcoX project funded by the
   ANR-Equipex programme from the French government for new
   infrastructures of scientific excellence.

   FAME, the French Absorption spectroscopy beamline in Material and
   Environmental science, is dedicated to X-ray absorption spectroscopy.
   FAME covers a wide variety of scientific fields (materials science,
   biophysics, chemistry) but focuses mainly in geochemical sciences
   where, in most cases, the probed elements are highly diluted.

   FAME being a bending magnet beamline, the optical elements have been
   designed in order firstly to maximize the photon flux on the sample and
   secondly to optimize the beamline stability and reduce the
   non-statistical noise (Proux et al. Journal of Synchrotron Radiation 13
   (2006) 59-68). Moreover, for an optimal acquisition of XAS spectra on
   diluted elements, the intense x-ray beam on the sample needs to be
   associated with a highly sensitive detection system: fluorescence
   detection is achieved with a 30-element Canberra Ge solid state
   detector.

   Opened to users since 2002, the beamline offers several sample
   environments, either to improve the measurements (helium cryostat),
   either to carry out in-situ measurements (HP-HT vessel, gaseous cell),
   and can accept many other apparatus.
     __________________________________________________________________

   FAME is one of the French CRG beamlines at the ESRF: beamtime can be
   asked both through the ESRF and the Soleil program committees.

   Deadlines for proposal submission:

   February 15^th 2020 for CRG beamtime  and March 1^st 2020 for ESRF
   beamtime.

Tracing titanium dioxide nanoparticles in the environment

     * News
     * Spotlight on Science

   03-01-2019

   The abundance of titanium dioxide nanoparticles in the environment
   originating from human activities could be a potential environmental
   problem. To identify and distinguish between titanium dioxide
   nanoparticles from natural and anthropogenic sources, synchrotron
   techniques were used to study the nanoparticles in sewage sludge and
   soil.

   Titanium dioxide nanoparticles are one of the most commonly produced
   nanomaterials worldwide. They are present in many consumer products,
   such as sunscreen and confectionery. After use, a large proportion of
   TiO[2] ends up in agricultural soils, through the application of sewage
   sludge. A prerequisite for risk assessment is to be able to distinguish
   this released TiO[2] from the elevated TiO[2] natural background, and
   therefore detect anthropogenic inputs. Furthermore, the current models
   of nanomaterial fluxes in environmental compartments have large
   uncertainties, therefore field monitoring is needed to be able to
   quantify actual anthropogenic inputs. Therefore, an evaluation of the
   differences in terms of composition and structure between natural and
   anthropogenic nanomaterials may provide clues to help interpret data on
   toxicity.

   In this study, the potential of physical techniques to distinguish
   natural versus anthropogenic particles has been investigated. Three
   matrices were compared: sewage sludge, agricultural soil that had never
   received sewage sludge, and sludge-amended soil. They were studied
   using micro and nano X-ray fluorescence and bulk and micro X-ray
   absorption spectroscopy at beamlines ID21 and ID16B, by X-ray
   diffraction at beamline BM25, and by transmission electron microscopy.

   The size distribution of TiO[2] particles was determined by image
   analysis of the Ti nanoXRF maps. This revealed that the soil and sludge
   have a similar size distribution, with a range of nano- and micro-scale
   particles. Bulk Ti K-edge XANES spectroscopy showed that the two major
   Ti species were the TiO[2] polymorphs anatase and rutile. In the
   sludge, there were roughly equal proportions of rutile and anatase.
   This information is important because rutile and anatase have different
   toxicities, and it is very difficult to know which polymorph is used in
   which type of product, and the global proportions of rutile and anatase
   released into the environment. Amorphous TiO[2] was also detected as a
   minor species in the soil and in the sludge by µXANES. The combination
   of µXRF and µXANES data showed that there was no relationship between
   the size of the aggregates and Ti speciation.

   Finally, the morphology of the crystals observed by electron microscopy
   and the status of TiO[2] particles within the organo-mineral aggregates
   proved to be relevant criteria to discriminate natural versus
   anthropogenic TiO[2]. In the sludge, smooth particles typical of TiO[2]
   pigments were evidenced (Figure 1c, 1f), whereas the soil contained
   rough and irregular TiO[2] particles. Moreover, TiO[2] particles in the
   sludge were present as weakly evolved aggregates, dominated by organic
   matter (Figure 1a-b and Figure 2), whereas in the soil they were
   intimately associated with organo-mineral assemblages forming the soil
   micro- and macroaggregates (Figure 1d-f and Figure 2), the building
   blocks of soils.
   TEM analyses and energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis of the TiO2
   particles present in sludge and soil.

   Figure 1. TEM analyses of the TiO[2] particles present in sludge (a–c)
   and soil (d–e). (f) Energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis of the zones
   highlighted in (c) and (e).

   Although TiO[2] phases are generally considered as very weakly soluble,
   they undergo weathering and transformations in acidic soils or in the
   rhizosphere [1]. Thus, the observed differences in particle morphology
   may attenuate over time due to the weathering of TiO[2] minerals.
   Likewise, even if it is slow (in the range of decades, although this
   has been debated), the formation of soil aggregates is a dynamic and
   continuous process, so the progressive incorporation of anthropogenic
   TiO[2] within soil organo-mineral assemblages is expected. It is likely
   that with time, engineered TiO[2] becomes indistinguishable from the
   natural background in soils.

   and Si.

   To conclude, the X-ray studies complemented microscopy methods
   providing chemical identification of the TiO[2] species and location of
   the nanoparticles within soil and sludge matrixes.

   which 4.2 million Euros are earmarked for the EcoX project, and 12
   million Euros for the ThomX project.

   EcoX, proposed by the University of Grenoble and CNRS, foresees the
   construction of a completely new beamline at the ESRF to study the
   behavior of a wide range of metallic elements in biological systems and
   nanomaterials. The electronic structure and chemical reactivity of
   metals and metalloids is a major topic of front line research into
   environmental issues, health and toxicity, chemical engineering, and
   production of sustainable energy.

   This project will in particular provide data on the presence of toxic
   heavy metals in the environment, and on their toxicity for humans.

   ThomX is a joint project by seven partners from industry and academia
   which include Synchrotron Soleil and the ESRF. Its objective is to
   develop a compact X-ray source with a highly brilliant, directional,
   monochromatic and tunable beam for applications in the medical sciences
   (imagery and therapy), in cultural heritage and industrial
   technologies.

   After development of a prototype, French company THALES will turn this
   source into a commercial product for hospitals and museums around the
   world.

   "The jurys' concern with this call for proposals was to select the
   projects that will enable France to make an important technological
   step forward", said Valérie Pécresse, French Minister for Research,
   when she unveiled the 52 winning projects. The ESRF is pleased to have
   been invited to contribute to this joint effort.

   Mercury is a potent neurotoxin present in our daily lives and our body
   can accumulate it over the years. Food consumption, such as fish and
   rice, is the most common source of mercury exposure. Mercury can be
   found in dental amalgams, compact fluorescence lamps, vaccines, drugs,
   and electronics or can be used in artisanal gold mining. Finding the
   source of mercury contamination in our bodies is crucial for treatment
   and forensic investigations, but at present knowledge of the molecular
   form of mercury in human tissues and fluids, which could indicate
   source, is limited. However, an international team from the CNRS, the
   Universities of Grenoble Alpes, Bordeaux and Franche-Comté, France, the
   ESRF, the European synchrotron in Grenoble, France and the University
   of Illinois at Chicago, US, has developed new analytical capabilities
   that allow the identification of chemical forms of mercury in human
   hair that trace exposure. These results are published in Environmental
   Science & Technology.

   Mercury contamination, a public health issue

   Mercury is considered by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as one of
   the top ten chemicals or groups of chemicals of major public health
   concern. Exposure to mercury – even small amounts – may cause serious
   health problems in the nervous, digestive and immune systems, and is
   particularly dangerous for very young children and development of the
   child in utero. Identifying the type of mercury contamination, the
   dose, and the period and duration of exposure could provide key
   indicators to treat mercury poisoning.


   New analytical capabilities to identify chemical forms of mercury in
   human hair

   Until today, depending on the suspected source of contamination,
   mercury intake has been monitored by measurement of mercury
   concentration in urine, blood, or scalp hair. These measurements help
   to diagnose the dose of poisoning and provide data for epidemiological
   studies, but provide incomplete information on the source of mercury
   exposure essential for treatment and forensic investigations.

   Spectral signature of two chemical forms of mercury in hair, one
   originating from fish consumption and the other from removal of a
   dental amalgam. In the first case (fish), mercury is methylated and
   bonded to one cysteine sulfur and one amine group from hair proteins
   (mostly keratin). In the second (dental amalgam), mercury is bonded to
   two cysteine sulfurs and two amine groups from hair
   proteins. @A.Manceau


   “Although urinary mercury concentration is considered to be the most
   accurate and widely used biomarker for assessing chronic exposure to
   mercury vapour and divalent mercury, we showed that inorganic mercury
   from dental amalgams can be detected in hair with distinct
   intermolecular structure from that of methylmercury from fish
   consumption” says Jean-Paul Bourdineaud, Professor of environmental
   toxicology at the University of Bordeaux, France.

   “Epidemiological studies on mercury intake through fish consumption
   assume that hair concentration is an indicator of only this source. Our
   results show that this assumption may not always be true” says Kathryn
   Nagy, Professor of Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University
   of Illinois at Chicago.

   With an average growth rate of about 1 cm per month, hair can capture
   contamination events with high time resolution. The team of researchers
   developed new analytical capabilities that allowed them to identify
   chemical forms of mercury in human hair. Using new synchrotron
   instrumentation, they found that mercury can be linked to source of
   exposure by precise characterisation of its bonding environment.

   Experiments at the ESRF have shown, for example, that a mercury spike
   along a hair strand was correlated, in this particular case, with a
   specific unsafe removal of dental amalgam. The data provide signatures
   of mercury sources, distinguish exogenous vs. endogenous exposure to
   inorganic mercury, and indicate the timing to within 1 or 2 days of an
   exposure event.

   The technical challenges

   As straightforward as it may seem, the team had to deal with some
   technical challenges before managing to retrieve this information:
   structural characterisation is complicated by the low concentration of
   mercury typical of most of the general population’s hair (typically 0.1
   to 3 ng of mercury/mg hair), and the flexibility of the mercury bonding
   environment which exhibits diverse coordination arrangements with
   carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur atoms.

   "When we realized that the microscopic 2.5 ng mercury hot-spot had a
   specific molecular signature, we were amazed. Still, to preclude any
   ambiguity on its origin, we had to determine the form of mercury and
   how it was chemically bonded to the hair proteins. This took several
   months of intense data analysis and calculations" says Alain Manceau,
   Director of Research at the CNRS.

   (b) Longitudinal profile from an individual affected by extraction of a
   dental amalgam. The mercury spike records the contamination event. 1
   ppm = 1 ng/mg. @A.Manceau


   To address these challenges, the team used the high performance
   capabilities of the ESRF by exploiting the X-ray nanoprobe experimental
   station at ID16B, an ESRF nano-analysis beamline, and by constructing a
   high-luminosity X-ray crystal multi-analyser that fully takes advantage
   of the high-brilliance of the ESRF ID26 spectrometer beamline.

   As explained by Remi Tucoulou, scientist at ID16B, and Pieter Glatzel,
   scientist at ID26: “Such measurements on samples with very low metal
   concentrations require instruments that are extremely sensitive and at
   the same time provide very high resolution for chemical
   characterisation.”

   The multi-analyser was funded by the EcoX project funded by the
   ANR-Equipex programme from the French government for new
   infrastructures of scientific excellence.
