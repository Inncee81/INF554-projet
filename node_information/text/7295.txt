   (CNN)Talk about bad timing.
   A Tesla electric police patrol car in the Bay Area ran low on power at
   one of the worst possible times last Friday -- during a pursuit.
   It's unclear exactly why the 2014 Tesla Model S 85 wasn't fully charged
   and lost juice at such an inopportune moment, according to Fremont
   Police Department's spokesperson, Geneva Bosques.

   "It happens from time to time, especially if an officer returns to the
   station to take a report and then they never go back out in the
   street," she told CNN.
   The police officer driving the Tesla was pursuing a suspect who was
   wanted in connection with a crime in Santa Clara, according to Bosques.
   After confirming the license plate, the officer attempted a traffic
   stop, the car failed to yield and the driver took off at a high rate of
   speed, she said.

   "Just realized I am down to six miles of battery on the Tesla, so I may
   lose it here in a sec," the officer driving the Tesla said, according
   to Fremont Police dispatch audio obtained via Broadcastify.
   Other police units were following behind to assist and ultimately took
   over the pursuit with help from California State Highway Patrol,
   according to Bosques. She said the chase was called off after 10
   minutes when it was deemed unsafe because of the way the suspect was
   driving.
   California State Highway Patrol later found the suspect's car abandoned
   in San Jose.
   Fremont Police said they are still in their 6 months of a pilot program
   testing the integration of the Tesla with the department and that they
   are keeping track of all the data.

   "We have no written policy regarding gas or charging, but the general
   guideline is that it should at least be half full at the beginning of
   the shift, which this car was," Bosques said.
   Bosques said last week's incident doesn't change the way the department
   feels about the performance of the car for patrol purposes.

   CNN's Konstantin Toropin contributed to this report.

   (CNN)The British Parliament has been back in business for less than a
   day and already the Brexit debate has reached a new and dizzying level
   of bizarreness.
   On Wednesday evening amid ugly scenes in the House of Commons, a
   combative Boris Johnson took the extraordinary step of daring Jeremy
   Corbyn, the leader of the official opposition, to call a vote of no
   confidence in the government he leads. Parliament was "paralyzed," the
   Prime Minister argued. "This Parliament must either stand aside and let
   this government get Brexit done, or bring a vote of confidence and
   finally face the day of reckoning with the voters," he said.
   Corbyn declined Johnson's kind offer. "I thank the Prime Minister for
   an advance copy of his statement," he told lawmakers. "Unfortunately,
   it was like his illegal shutting down of Parliament -- null, of no
   effect, and should be quashed, in the words of the Supreme Court."

   To people looking on from the UK and around the world, it all must have
   looked completely topsy-turvy. Johnson says he wants an election, but
   can't make it happen. The opposition claims it wants an election, but
   won't make it happen. British politics is in a deeply weird place. The
   government and the opposition each hold the keys to giving the other
   what they want, but neither wants to be the one to release the lock.

   Johnson is leading a minority government and wants an early general
   election as soon as possible. In order to get one, he needs the country
   to believe he is fighting tooth and nail to get Brexit over the line,
   once and for all. Corbyn and the rest of the opposition are frustrating
   his efforts at every turn. That's the message he is hammering home,
   over and over.

   If the polls are to be believed, it's a narrative that's working in his
   favor.
   Labour and the rest of Johnson's opponents, however, only want an
   election after they can be absolutely sure that the looming October 31
   Brexit deadline has been neutered. Only a delay, they argue, would
   prevent a no-deal Brexit which they believe would cause economic havoc,
   and even put lives at risk.

   Corbyn outlines how he would handle Brexit 02:32
   Doubtless, they are sincere in this argument. However, it's hard to
   ignore the idea floated in some corners that if Brexit is delayed,
   Johnson would have failed to deliver his central promise and his poll
   numbers would collapse. A clearer path to power, therefore, would
   emerge for Labour and the other UK opposition parties.
   That's why Corbyn may not bring forward a confidence vote now, but
   instead continue to pile political pressure on the Prime Minister to
   resign. If the Labour leader can force that scenario, someone else
   would be forced to ask Brussels for a Brexit extension and Johnson
   would be cast as an abject failure who quit when the going got tough.
   All of which would presumably work to the electoral advantage of one
   Jeremy Corbyn.
   Johnson and Corbyn, it seems, are trying to trick the other into acting
   against their own interest. The politics of the UK have seldom been
   this baffling.
   It's hard to see that this will lead to anything other than a
   monumental grudge match. We got a taste of it on Wednesday -- the
   exchanges in the Commons were among the angriest and most bitter in
   years.
   Geoffrey Cox, the Attorney General, said Parliament was "dead" and "no
   moral right" to sit. Johnson, later, peppered his remarks with the
   people-versus-parliament rhetoric of "surrender" and "betrayal" that
   has become his trademark.
   In response to calls from Labour MPs to moderate his tone and reflect
   on the politically motivated murder three years ago of lawmaker Jo Cox,
   Johnson said: "The best way to honor Jo Cox's memory is to get Brexit
   done." Even some Conservative MPs were aghast that the Prime Minister
   would use the horror to make a political point.

   But don't expect him to back down. Johnson thinks it will work, and
   there will be more to come.
   Parliament is back -- and angrier than ever. The next few weeks will
   get even uglier.

   London (CNN)UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is facing pressure over his
   alleged relationship with the American businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri
   during the time he served as the Mayor of London.
   Johnson has been given 14 days to provide the details of the
   relationship after the Sunday Times reported that a company run by the
   tech entrepreneur received tens of thousands of pounds in public
   funding when Johnson was mayor.

   conference in London in 2014.

   conference in London in 2014.
   The company also had access to overseas trade missions headed by the
   then mayor, according to the newspaper. The Sunday Times alleged Arcuri
   was given preferential treatment when it came to joining the missions,
   despite her business "not meeting the eligibility criteria for any of
   the three Johnson trade missions she attended in the space of just a
   year."

   The Oversight Committee of the Greater London Authority has asked
   Johnson to disclose details and a timeline of all contact with Arcuri
   during his 2008-16 mayoral term. They also want the PM to explain how
   that alleged personal relationship was disclosed at the time Arcuri was
   awarded the grants.
   Arcuri and her company did not respond to CNN's request for comment.
   She told the Sunday Times any grants received and any trade mission I
   joined were purely in respect of my role as a legitimate
   businesswoman."

   Downing Street declined to comment on the allegations. Johnson himself
   first dodged the topic, then suggested in a BBC interview everything
   was done "entirely in the proper way."
   The issue was even discussed in Parliament on Wednesday, when lawmakers
   forced an official from the government's Department for Digital,
   Culture, Media and Sport to come into the debating chamber and answer
   questions about his agencies role in awarding Arcuri's company their
   most recent public money.
   Arcuri's latest company, Hacker House, was awarded £100,000 ($123,000)
   funding earlier this year from the department. The company says it
   provides "practical ethical hacking skills" training online. The
   funding was part of a program aiming to increase the diversity and
   numbers of those working in the UK's cyber security sector.
   Questioned about a possible conflict of interest, Matt Warman, the
   undersecretary of state for digital, said all grants are awarded
   through transparent and competitive way. He added the company has been
   paid "some £47,000" to date.
   "We are of course aware of the claims raised recently by The Sunday
   Times and the department is reviewing the decision that was taken," he
   said.

   ruling
   Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran alleged in Parliament that the funding
   was meant for businesses based in the UK, and added that Arcuri lives
   in the US.
   Warman said the company's location will be part of the review. "But it
   is a company with a British phone number," he said, adding that Johnson
   was not involved in the decision to award the grant.
   Moran also said the funding the company received was higher than what
   it was eligible for, saying the grant was set at maximum of 50% of a
   company's income. Warman said the officials scored the application
   highly and "decided the other aspects more than outweighed that
   particular individual criteria."

   The company's registered address in central London is a building that
   houses offices for rent, as well as "virtual offices," a service that
   makes it possible for businesses to have a physical presence in London
   without any actual space or desks. It is not clear if Hacker House uses
   that service.
   Hacker House was not immediately available to comment. The company did
   not respond to email and voice mail.

   ____________________

   New York (CNN)Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States had
   "a productive week" of discussion with allies on Iran and suggested the
   US remained open to negotiations with the nation, despite Iranian
   President Hassan Rouhani hours earlier squashing any prospects of a
   meeting with his US counterpart.
   "We want peace, we want a peaceful resolution with the Islamic Republic
   of Iran. We're hoping we can get that way. In the end it'll be up to
   the Iranians to make that decision," Pompeo said Wednesday in a news
   conference alongside President Donald Trump. "We hope we can get the
   opportunity to negotiate with them and get an outcome that's good for
   both them, for the United States to make sure they never have a nuclear
   weapon and that they can't foment their terror with ballistic missiles
   and in the way they have all around the world."
   "And I thought we made real progress uniting the world on that here
   over the past few days," Pompeo added.

   However, just hours earlier, Rouhani declared that negotiations can't
   take place until sanctions are lifted -- a step the US not only refuses
   to take, but doubled down on earlier in the day by announcing new
   penalties.
   "On behalf of my nation and state, I would like to announce that our
   response to any negotiation under sanctions is negative," Rouhani said
   Wednesday in his address to the United Nations General Assembly.

Travel restrictions

   Shortly after Pompeo voiced the US desire for peace, the White House
   announced sweeping visa restrictions on senior Iranian officials and
   their immediate families. Citing Iranian behavior that "threatens peace
   and stability in the Middle East and beyond," Trump wrote in a
   presidential proclamation, "I have determined that it is in the
   interest of the United States to take action to restrict and suspend
   the entry into the United States, as immigrants or nonimmigrants, of
   senior government officials of Iran, and their immediate family
   members."
   The proclamation notes that there would be exceptions in accordance
   with "United States Government obligations under applicable
   international agreements."
   Ahead of the General Assembly, Iran accused the US of slow walking
   visas for its official delegation. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad
   Javad Zarif was already subject to visa restrictions due to earlier US
   sanctions.

'Edge of collapse'

   In his general assembly speech, Rouhani spoke of the precarious
   situation in the region and issued a warning.
   "Our region is on the edge of collapse," Rouhani said, "as a single
   blunder can fuel a big fire. We shall not tolerate the provocative
   intervention of foreigners. We shall respond decisively and strongly to
   any sort of transgression to and violation of our security and
   territorial integrity."
   He decried the US presence in the Middle East and American efforts to
   create an international maritime security force in the Persian Gulf.
   Urging countries in the region to work together, he said the issues
   facing Iran and its neighbors are too big and important for Washington
   to solve.
   Rouhani spoke as Trump has been signaling his interest in starting
   talks with Tehran, but the European Union warned the Iran nuclear deal
   is increasingly under pressure and US allies, particularly French
   President Emmanuelle Macron, are pushing the two sides to begin a
   dialogue.

   In his own address to the UN General Assembly Tuesday, Trump noted that
   that many of America's "greatest friends" used to be enemies. "The
   United States has never believed in permanent enemies," Trump told the
   audience.
   Later in the day, Trump told reporters that meeting with Iran made
   sense. "They're here. We're here ... it certainly makes sense, but we
   haven't agreed to that yet."
   For a second day Wednesday, tensions in the Persian Gulf were
   overshadowed by the day's dominating news of Trump's request that
   Ukraine investigate his chief political rival at the moment, former
   Vice President Joe Biden, and the House of Representatives decision to
   launch an impeachment inquiry.

'The harshest sanctions'

   In his remarks, the Iranian leader condemned the Trump administration's
   "maximum pressure" campaign and the impact on Iranian people. He called
   on the US to return to the Iran nuclear deal, formally known as the
   Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, that the US exited in May 2018.
   "The government and people of Iran have remained steadfast against the
   harshest sanctions in the past one and a half years and will never
   negotiate with an enemy that seeks to make Iran surrender with the
   weapon of poverty, pressure and sanctions," Rouhani said. "The only way
   for talks to begin is to return to commitments and compliance. If you
   are sensitive to the name of JCPOA, then, well, you can return to its
   framework."
   Rouhani laid out his conditions not long after Pompeo announced new
   Iran-related sanctions on Chinese companies transporting oil from Iran
   and their executive officers.
   "We're telling China and all nations, know that we will sanction every
   violation of sanctionable activity," Pompeo said at a conference
   organized by the group United Against Nuclear Iran.
   Pompeo also said the US was "taking new action to disentangle" Iran's
   Revolutionary Guard Corps "from the Iranian economy."
   "The United States will intensify our efforts to educate countries and
   companies on the risk of doing business with IRGC entities and we will
   punish them if they persist in defiance of our warnings," he said.
   The Treasury Department said in a release that based on a determination
   by Pompeo it would sanction COSCO Shipping Tanker (Dalian) Co. and
   COSCO Shipping Tanker (Dalian) Seaman & Ship Management Co., along with
   a few other companies and a slew of individuals.
   The Trump administration has steadily ratcheted up economic pressure on
   Iran since leaving the 2015 international pact that constrained its
   nuclear program in exchange for economic relief. Those penalties now
   cover all essential pillars of the economy, including its central bank
   and sovereign wealth fund.
   The US says its goal is to get Iran back to the table to renegotiate
   the nuclear deal to include Iran's ballistic missile program and its
   activities in the Middle East.
   But Tehran has pushed back.
   The US has blamed Iran for attacks on oil tankers in the Persian Gulf
   and for the devastating strike on a Saudi Aramco facility that American
   officials say was conducted by drone and missile. Germany, France and
   the UK have also said Iran bears responsibility. Yemen-based Houthi
   rebels have claimed the attack was their doing.
   On Wednesday, Rouhani argued that the US was not capable of being a
   stabilizing force in the region and called for regional countries to
   band together to join an Iranian maritime security initiative he called
   the "Coalition for Hope."

'Coalition for hope'

   With such a maritime group, "the free flow of oil and other energy
   resources could be guaranteed, provided that we consider security as an
   umbrella in all areas for all the countries," Rouhani said.
   In contrast, Rouhani said the US effort to organize an international
   force to patrol the Persian Gulf "is a clear example of interference in
   the affairs of the region. The securitization of navigation"
   contravenes the right to free navigation and would escalate tensions,
   and increase "mistrust in the region while jeopardizing regional peace,
   security and stability."
   The Iranian leader also argued that security will come to the region
   "when American troops pull out." Calling on "neighbors" to work
   together, Rouhani said that, "security shall not be supplied with
   American weapons and intervention."
   "The United States has failed to resolve the issue in Afghanistan, Iraq
   and Syria," Rouhani said, using the Arabic acronym for ISIS. "Such a
   government is clearly unable to resolve more sophisticated issues."

'Increasingly difficult'

   Iran continued to comply with the nuclear deal for more than a year
   after the US began its sanctions push, until recently, when it has
   begun violating some of its terms.

   Speaking to media outside the UN General Assembly hall, EU Foreign
   Policy Chief Federica Mogherini said it's becoming harder to preserve
   the nuclear deal. "I will not hide that is increasingly difficult to do
   it and we have discussed today that fact that we will try to continue
   keeping the agreement in place and overcome the difficulties that we're
   facing," she said.
   "What I believe is that every step that has been taken so far by Iran,
   and I underline, so far, is reversible," Mogherini added. "We have
   constantly called upon Iran to reverse these decisions and go back to
   full compliance, which has been the case till recently because this is
   in the interests of all."

   How #MeToo spread from Hollywood to the high court (2018) 03:31

   Paris (CNN)A court in Paris has ordered the founder of France's #MeToo
   movement to pay thousands of euros in damages for defaming a man by
   accusing him of making lewd comments about her.
   In October 2017, French journalist Sandra Muller accused television
   producer Eric Brion of making the comments about her at a party and
   shared the details on Twitter, using the hashtag #balancetonporc, which
   roughly translates to "squeal on your pig."
   Ultimately, her story inspired thousands of others to share their
   experiences of sexual harassment and assault, catapulting France's
   national discourse on sexualized violence into the global spotlight.

   French journalist Sandra Muller was ordered to to pay thousands of
   euros for defaming a man on social media.

   On Wednesday a French court ordered Muller to pay €15,000 ($16,500) in
   damages to Brion, as well as €5,000 ($5,500) of legal fees, Muller's
   lawyer confirmed to CNN.
   She has also been ordered to delete the tweeted comments and to share
   the court's statements on her account, according to the Agence
   France-Presse (AFP) news agency.

   In June, Brion acknowledged to the court that he made the inappropriate
   remarks, but said he apologized for them by text message the day after.

   from speaking out?

   He said he did not receive a response to his apology and that "Muller's
   violence against me has never stopped. The violence of people hiding
   behind their phones."
   His lawyer, Marie Burguburu, previously told CNN that while he admitted
   to the comment, the reason they were filing a defamation suit was
   because Muller had accused him of "sexual harassment at work" on
   Twitter.
   While he has said that he regretted his words, Brion previously noted
   in Le Monde that he would rather have been tried in a court of justice
   than in the court of social media.
   Muller told CNN affiliate BFMTV after the verdict that the sentence was
   "disappointing" and that she will "keep fighting every day."
   "This decision does not mean women have to stop talking. Women have to
   keep expressing themselves, women have to continue denouncing
   reprehensible behaviors -- all of them," she said. "Fear must not win."
   Critics of the ruling were quick to point out the absurdity of the
   case, and how Muller's efforts to expose sexual harassment resulted in
   her having to pay out.
   Marie Laguerre, whose violent assault in Paris in 2018 went viral after
   it was captured on video, told CNN: "I am angry! This ruling sends a
   clear message: it's better to keep quiet. And, the reputation of a man
   is worth more than the body of a woman.

   "Sandra is paying the price for having broken her silence and paving
   the way for many other women to do the same," Laguerre said.
   Meanwhile, Muller's lawyer, Francis Szpiner, tweeted that that they
   would be appealing the court's decision.
