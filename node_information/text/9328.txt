About

   We understand that some people have more of an understanding of the
   phrase online behavioural advertising than others. This website has
   been put together to make this topic clearer for everyone.


   Put simply, behavioural advertising is a practice that is based on
   internet browsing activity and allows brands to deliver adverts to web
   users which reflect their interests. It’s safe, transparent, and
   designed to empower you, the consumer.


   The European advertising industry has developed a set of good practice
   principles that businesses should follow. This good practice is based
   upon businesses being transparent about the information that is
   collected and used for this purpose and seeks to provide you with
   control. At the heart of this is a new ‘icon’ or symbol that is now
   appearing in the advertisements you may see on websites.


What is behavioural advertising?


   Online behavioural advertising (also known as interest-based
   advertising) is a way of serving advertisements on the websites you
   visit and making them more relevant to you and your interests. Shared
   interests are grouped together based upon previous web browsing
   activity and web users are then served advertising which matches their
   shared interests. In this way, advertising can be made as relevant and
   useful as possible. Relevant ads can also be delivered based upon the
   website content you have just been viewing. This is known as
   ‘retargeting’.


How does it work?


   IFRAME: http://www.youtube.com/embed/Y9Y4Efyxmk4?rel=0


Who are the companies that are involved in behavioural advertising?


   The following types of companies are involved:

     * Advertiser – a company that sells a product or service and runs
       advertising campaigns to promote that product or service.


     * Advertising Server – a company with technology that delivers
       advertising to a relevant page on a website.


     * Advertising Network – a company that connects websites and web
       publishers with relevant advertisers.


     * Advertising Exchange – a company that acts as an open market place
       for the buying and selling of advertising.


     * Advertising Agency – a company that works with advertisers to
       create campaigns to promote that advertiser’s product or service.


     * Advertising Agency Trading Desk – a team within an advertising
       agency that works with Demand Side Platforms to manage campaigns.


     * Data Aggregator – a company that pulls together information from
       multiple sources and builds ‘segments’ based on interests (eg car
       buyers).


     * Demand Side Platform – a company that allows advertisers to connect
       with web publishers.


     * Sell Side Platform – a company that works with web publishers to
       help maximise the money received from selling advertising on the
       publisher’s site.


     * Web Publisher – a company that promotes its products and services
       via its website and, in this context, sells advertising on the site
       to help pay for them. An advertiser will have its own website and
       therefore will also be referred to as a web publisher.


   Below you can see how all these companies work to deliver advertising.

How is my privacy protected?


   The information collected and used for this type of advertising is not
   personal, in that it does not identify you – the user – in the real
   world. No personal information, such as your name, address or email
   address, is used. Data about your browsing activity is collected and
   analysed anonymously. If this analysis infers a particular interest,
   a cookie – a small file used by most websites to store useful bits of
   information to make your use of the internet better – is placed in your
   computer and this cookie (not your browsing data) determines what
   advertising you receive. You can control which cookies you accept or
   refuse.


   The company collecting and using the data will also have a way for you
   to decline behavioural advertising and the EU wide good practice
   principles are specifically designed to give you more information and
   control over this type of advertising.  We have brought all the
   relevant businesses together in this site so you have only one place to
   exercise control. Click here to opt out of behavioural advertising.
   Remember: turning off behavioural advertising does NOT mean that there
   will no more advertising on the internet. However, the advertising that
   you do see is likely to be less relevant to your interests.
