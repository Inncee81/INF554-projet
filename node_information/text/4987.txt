What is the Internet of Things?

   The Internet of Things refers to the growing range of connected devices
   that send data across the Internet

   The IoT is now a reality due to the convergence of several technologies

   A “thing” is any object or device with embedded electronics that can
   transfer data over a network — without any human interaction. So
   imagine if you had smart devices in your car, your workplace or even on
   yourself.

   The Internet of Things can make running your enterprise easier and
   reinvent the way you interact with the physical world.

IBM Blockchain for business – and everyday life

   Learn how this breakthrough technology is transforming food you eat,
   goods you consume and promises you make. Let’s put smart to work.™

Blockchain ensures safer food

   We all eat – and we’ve all had second thoughts about food’s safety or
   freshness.

   What if we could replace those doubts with visibility into every step
   from farm to fork? Right now, companies across the food supply are
   doing just that, sharing and using data from IBM Food Trust™, built on
   the IBM Blockchain Platform.

   Discover how growers, processors, distributors, retailers are others
   are making food safer, lengthening shelf lives, reducing waste, and
   unlocking better access to shared, secure information that impacts us
   all.

   Watch: How well do we know our food? Learn about IBM Food Trust™

Blockchain tracks every step in shipping

   Think of everything you’ve used today. How did it all get here?

   Today’s supply chain is a complex network of relationships, scheduling,
   systems and data. Even the smallest error can lead to delays that have
   tremendous ripple effects.

   By digitizing and automating paperwork across supply chains, IBM
   Blockchain helps shippers, ports, customs services, logistics
   providers, banks, insurers and others better manage documents across
   organizational boundaries and geographic borders – all in real time and
   with absolute precision.

   Learn about IBM Blockchain for supply chain

Blockchain spreads trust everywhere

   Whether it’s between people or organizations, relationships flourish
   with more trust.

   From the jewelry you wear to the insurance that protects your family,
   IBM Blockchain can elevate that trust to an entirely new level by
   helping parties transacting together validate and share immutable
   transaction records on a private, distributed ledger.

   This shared record of truth — a form of digital trust unlike anything
   the world has seen — leads to everything from less paperwork and fewer
   disputes to happier customers and entirely new ways of doing business.

IBM Blockchain for business – and everyday life

   Learn how this breakthrough technology is transforming food you eat,
   goods you consume and promises you make. Let’s put smart to work.™

Blockchain ensures safer food

   We all eat – and we’ve all had second thoughts about food’s safety or
   freshness.

   What if we could replace those doubts with visibility into every step
   from farm to fork? Right now, companies across the food supply are
   doing just that, sharing and using data from IBM Food Trust™, built on
   the IBM Blockchain Platform.

   Discover how growers, processors, distributors, retailers are others
   are making food safer, lengthening shelf lives, reducing waste, and
   unlocking better access to shared, secure information that impacts us
   all.

   Watch: How well do we know our food? Learn about IBM Food Trust™

Blockchain tracks every step in shipping

   Think of everything you’ve used today. How did it all get here?

   Today’s supply chain is a complex network of relationships, scheduling,
   systems and data. Even the smallest error can lead to delays that have
   tremendous ripple effects.

   By digitizing and automating paperwork across supply chains, IBM
   Blockchain helps shippers, ports, customs services, logistics
   providers, banks, insurers and others better manage documents across
   organizational boundaries and geographic borders – all in real time and
   with absolute precision.

   Learn about IBM Blockchain for supply chain

Blockchain spreads trust everywhere

   Whether it’s between people or organizations, relationships flourish
   with more trust.

   From the jewelry you wear to the insurance that protects your family,
   IBM Blockchain can elevate that trust to an entirely new level by
   helping parties transacting together validate and share immutable
   transaction records on a private, distributed ledger.

   This shared record of truth — a form of digital trust unlike anything
   the world has seen — leads to everything from less paperwork and fewer
   disputes to happier customers and entirely new ways of doing business.
