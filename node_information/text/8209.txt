   BBC Two

   With Peaky Blinders heading into its fourth season on BBC Two beginning
   November 15 in the UK, creator Steven Knight and core cast members
   including Cillian Murphy, Paul Anderson and Helen McCrory recently
   shared their thoughts about the latest installment in the lives of the
   Shelby family, as well as the future of the series and a possible
   transfer to the big screen (says Knight, “Peaky is now a beast that
   will not die”). On a visit to the Peaky set, I also spoke with new cast
   member Adrien Brody.

   The plot of Season 4 has been held pretty close to the vest, but it
   kicks off with Tommy Shelby estranged from his family after an intense
   Season 3 ending that saw him turn the tables and have them all
   arrested. This season, it’s back to the family’s roots. When Tommy
   realizes they are in danger of annihilation, he flees his country house
   and summons the family to return to the streets of Small Heath, where a
   desperate fight for survival begins.

   Murphy says that at the beginning of Season 4, “Tommy is trying to
   convince himself it’s okay. He’s trying to live with it and what
   happened to the rest of them. He’s not the sort of character who’s
   going to go to therapy… It’s an interesting place to find him
   completely estranged; family was his raison d’etre.” He also sees
   similarities to the first season. “These circumstances and the threat
   from outside mean the family has to regroup again and become good at
   what they were good at in series one. Obviously all the characters are
   older and all this water’s gone under the bridge, but I see a lot of
   parallels to series one and I think I do see as Tommy gets older in
   terms of his legacy and values and principals, if they were sort of
   atrophied within him, you can see them sort of beginning to stir.”

   McCrory (Aunt Polly) added at a recent press screening of episode one,
   “They’re all united against something you hate and fear. They have to
   get together to defend themselves.” It’s good news for Anderson’s
   Arthur Shelby who, the actor says, “would much rather be at Tommy’s
   side.”

   When I earlier caught up with the Blinders gang on set, they were
   filming scenes of a cat-and-mouse game between Tommy and Brody’s mafia
   scion who’s come to town from New York to seek revenge for the murder
   of his father. Murphy explained Tommy is “using the back streets of
   Birmingham where he grew up to lure them in.”

   Brody’s mobster cuts a sinister and menacing figure when he first
   appears. I’m told he also shares some parallels with Tommy, which will
   become more evident as the season rolls along.

   Brody told me, “There is a sense of respect that goes into what
   (Tommy’s) built, but things have to be set right. It’s an old-world
   kind of thing. There’s always retribution, people don’t forgive. There
   are a lot of parallels in both families that each character can relate
   to the other in a sense.”

   Exec producer Jamie Glazebrook (of series producer Caryn Mandabach
   Productions) noted that Brody’s character has “elements where it’s a
   mirror of Tommy. He also has a family who kind of disappoint and he
   also has an intellect and isn’t 100% comfortable with being a gangster.
   So what he brings is extraordinary.”

   As for Game Of Thrones’ alum Aidan Gillen’s role as Aberama Gold,
   Knight says, “If you’re threatened by the devil, you get a devil of
   your own.” Gillen’s character is “the devil you know.” Gillen himself
   has said Gold, “is a Romany gypsy with a reputation for being a
   dangerous man, somebody who is a kind of unknown quantity… some kind of
   a showman… a larger than life figure. Aberama is a man of his word, so
   he can be trusted to stick to his side of the deal, but he can also be
   trusted to ensure that nobody is attempting to get out of their side of
   the deal.”

   This season also introduces Charlie Murphy as Jessie Eden, the trade
   union activist who made history in the 1920s fighting for equal pay for
   women. Cillian Murphy says, “Politically, it gets very interesting
   between the two characters and I think she really shines a light on
   Tommy because he’s sort of very unpolitical in many respects. He’s a
   capitalist, but she begins to provoke that a bit.”

   And, Charlotte Riley is back as May Carleton. I asked Knight if she and
   Tommy will start up again and he demurred, “It depends what you mean by
   ‘start up,’ but there will definitely be a relationship.” Murphy added
   that viewers, “might get a little surprise.”

   Riley’s real-life husband, Tom Hardy, returns again as Alfie Solomons
   for a “showdown” with Tommy, says Murphy. Says Knight, “Alfie doesn’t
   change. He’ll be back and do his thing.”

   Looking ahead, Season 5 will be set in 1928 and 1929. Knight tells me,
   “That was the time of the early days of fascism in England which will
   make it quite of its time and of this time. It involves the royal
   family and Tory politics; it’s when Italy and Germany were sort of
   kicking off.”

   Although there have been suggestions that Season 5 will be the end of
   the run for Peaky, Knight today tells me, “The thought has long been to
   finish after Season 5, but the momentum and love for the thing seems to
   still be growing exponentially and this is making us pause before
   deciding finally.”

   Does Murphy think there’s going to be a sixth season? He laughs,
   telling me, “Listen, you know Steve has so many ideas, he’s so
   inventive, I wouldn’t be surprised. For me, I’ve always said as long as
   the writing stays as good as it is, I’m around.”

   What about plans for a film, and a mooted stage musical? Per Knight,
   “We are also keeping our minds open as regards a movie and we are
   making progress on the musical. Peaky is now a beast that will not
   die.”

   Murphy on a movie: “In theory, yeah absolutely if the writing is as
   good as it is for the show then for sure.” But the musical? “That’s not
   for me, I’m going to pass on that one.”

   Returning to the current season, Knight has said he wrote Brody’s role
   with the Oscar-winning actor in mind. It’s no secret that famous folk
   often offer up their services to the period gangster epic with the
   globally rabid fanbase, but Knight isn’t into stunt casting. “We get
   incoming from the most amazing actors that want to be in it, but what
   we don’t want to do is turn it into this celebrity show. And most of
   them are American, so it’s difficult to get them in. But when you have
   this list of possibilities in front of you…”

   Brody for his part told me he hadn’t seen all of the series before
   signing on, but when he got the call, “It was very exciting news, and
   then more exciting when I read the season.” He calls Peaky “a really
   special show. It’s amazing, once I got wind of it and started talking
   to friends — everybody I talk to knows about it.”

   Knight concurs, In Hollywood, he says, “I can’t get off the topic. If I
   go to any meeting anywhere with anybody you can’t get off the topic.”
   He also marvels that although Netflix (which airs Peaky in the U.S.)
   doesn’t share viewing figures, he has learned that Peaky reached No. 1
   in both Rhode Island and Montana last year. “What have they got in
   common?,” he wonders.

   Knight promises “a surprise” at the end of this current season. “I
   think they pay a big cost. As this series develops there will be
   losses. But I’m not a believer in pulling a prominent character’s death
   out of the bag in order to get people to talk about it because I think
   it’s a law of diminishing returns.”

   He makes no bones about seeing each progressive season of Peaky as its
   best yet. I asked Murphy what he thinks. “Well, it would be foolish to
   embark on it if you didn’t think that was going to be the case because
   it’s foolish to embark on any job I think unless you think it’s going
   to be your best work. I think for me, television shows only succeed if
   they sort of increase in service to confidence and storytelling and I
   think that this certainly is the case with our show.”

   “I mean, if you could bottle it,” he added, “we’d all be geniuses.”

   The House Intelligence Committee released a whistleblower’s complaint
   over President Donald Trump’s interactions with the president of
   Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky.

   The whistleblower, whose name is being kept confidential, reported
   receiving “information from multiple U.S. government officials that the
   president of the United States is using the power of his office to
   solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.
   This interference includes, among other things, pressuring a foreign
   country to investigate one of the president’s main domestic political
   rivals.”

   In the complaint, the whistleblower also names Trump’s personal lawyer,
   Rudy Giuliani, as a “central figure” in the effort, and that Attorney
   General William Barr “appears to be involved as well.”

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi Announces Formal Trump Impeachment Inquiry

   The release of the complaint was the latest twist in a fast-moving
   scandal, one that already has compelled House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to
   announce an impeachment investigation of Trump.

   On Wednesday, the White House released a non-verbatim transcript notes
   of a July 25 conversation that Trump had with Zelensky, in which the
   president asks him to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.

   Broadcast and cable news networks today were providing live coverage of
   an intelligence committee hearing in which Joseph Maguire, the acting
   director of national intelligence, is testifying. Democrats on the
   committee want to know why the whistleblower complaint was not quickly
   turned over to Congress.

   “This complaint is a roadmap for our investigation, and provides
   significant information for the committee to follow up on with other
   witnesses and documents,” said Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the chairman of
   the committee. “And it is corroborated by the call record released
   yesterday.”

   The complaint, dated on August 12, can be viewed here.

   The whistleblower said in the complaint, “I was not a direct witness to
   most of the events described.” But it is based on colleagues accounts
   of events found credible because, “in almost all cases, multiple
   officials recounted fact patterns that were consistent with one
   another.”

   The whistleblower wrote that the White House officials who relayed
   information about the call were “deeply disturbed by what transpired.”

   “They told me that there was already a ‘discussion ongoing’ with White
   House lawyers about how to treat the call because of the likelihood, in
   the officials’ retelling, that they had witnessed the president abuse
   his office for personal gain,” the whistleblower wrote.

   Skin is the true-life story of reformed white-supremacist Bryon Widner
   (played by Jamie Bell) a young man raised by skinheads, for whom
   turning his back on hatred and violence meant undergoing painful and
   expensive operations to remove the tattoos that signified his terrible
   past life — a process only possible with the support of a Black
   activist.

   Based on his short of the same name, writer/director Guy Nattiv talked
   to Deadline about how Bryon’s story hit close to him.

   “Because I grew up in Israel with grandfather stories about the
   Holocaust and about Nazism and the whole fascism that he went through.
   For me to see to see someone who went through it in another way, a
   different way, and this journey that this guy made touched me.”

   He continued, “My grandfather told me about how he started to forgive
   the second and third generation of Germans and forgiveness is something
   that we really cherish in our family, it’s a value he gave us. So I
   felt a lot of forgiveness to Bryon.”

   The film, which had its world premiere at the Toronto International
   Film Festival, also stars Danielle Macdonald and Bill Camp, both of
   whom accompanied Nattiv’s at Deadline’s TIFF studio, as well as Mike
   Colter and Vera Farmiga.

   See the full interview above.

   Deadline Studio at TIFF 2018 presented by eOne. Special thanks to
   sponsor Watford Group, and partners Calii Love, Love Child Social,
   and Barocco Coffee.
