   Stare Mesto (Old Town)
   One of the oldest neighbourhoods in town represents
   the medieval heart of Prague. It’s no surprise it is
   bustling with tourists every time of day. Križovnický
   square, overlooking Charles Bridge with Prague Castle
   in the background, is probably the most beautiful
   square in the city. Its unique historical atmosphere
   of gothic houses and churches, cobblestone streets and
   squares, and stone towers blend together with the
   ...More
   modern era. A vast array of bars, restaurants, dance
   clubs, international brand shops, galleries and hotels
   bring life to the old city. With its charming and
   picturesque cobblestone streets, the nightlife and
   parties will surely be unforgettable.

   Stare Mesto (Old Town)
   One of the oldest neighbourhoods in town represents
   the medieval heart of Prague. It’s no surprise it is
   bustling with tourists every time of day. Križovnický
   square, overlooking Charles Bridge with Prague Castle
   in the background, is probably the most beautiful
   square in the city. Its unique historical atmosphere
   of gothic houses and churches, cobblestone streets and
   squares, and stone towers blend together with the
   ...More
   modern era. A vast array of bars, restaurants, dance
   clubs, international brand shops, galleries and hotels
   bring life to the old city. With its charming and
   picturesque cobblestone streets, the nightlife and
   parties will surely be unforgettable.

   Exactly what you would expect

   Offers what you would hope for from an Irish bar, including some Irish

   being charged 4 euro for soda water from the tap!!

   Good Bar for Casual Dinner

   It was raining when we visited Prague for sightseeing. We saw this Bar
   and choose the outside tent. We love the warmth and atmosphere of the
   Bar. Inside the Bar, there’s live music. We ordered Fish and Chips, Hot
   Tea, seafood Pasta and Cappuccino.

   Stare Mesto (Old Town)
   One of the oldest neighbourhoods in town represents
   the medieval heart of Prague. It’s no surprise it is
   bustling with tourists every time of day. Križovnický
   square, overlooking Charles Bridge with Prague Castle
   in the background, is probably the most beautiful
   square in the city. Its unique historical atmosphere
   of gothic houses and churches, cobblestone streets and
   squares, and stone towers blend together with the
   ...More
   modern era. A vast array of bars, restaurants, dance
   clubs, international brand shops, galleries and hotels
   bring life to the old city. With its charming and
   picturesque cobblestone streets, the nightlife and
   parties will surely be unforgettable.

   Stare Mesto (Old Town)
   One of the oldest neighbourhoods in town represents
   the medieval heart of Prague. It’s no surprise it is
   bustling with tourists every time of day. Križovnický
   square, overlooking Charles Bridge with Prague Castle
   in the background, is probably the most beautiful
   square in the city. Its unique historical atmosphere
   of gothic houses and churches, cobblestone streets and
   squares, and stone towers blend together with the
   ...More
   modern era. A vast array of bars, restaurants, dance
   clubs, international brand shops, galleries and hotels
   bring life to the old city. With its charming and
   picturesque cobblestone streets, the nightlife and
   parties will surely be unforgettable.

   Wouldn't buy anywhere else!

   The woman that worked in the shop was so friendly and helpful and she
   lets you try on what ever you would like. The store has some
   information about the history of garnets and the Bohemian Garnets in
   particular. You receive a certificate of authenticity...More

   Such a rich color
   Review of: Entrance ticket to The Bohemian Garnet Museum Prague

   I love garnet for its dark rich color. We had to visit once I saw the
   museum on one of our walks. The exposition is wonderful and any fan
   will leave satisfied.

   Had a wonderful jail trip. The rides back and forth are fantastic, and
   it's very nice to see the it itself. The self-directed tours are
   actually making the trick.

   Stare Mesto (Old Town)
   One of the oldest neighbourhoods in town represents
   the medieval heart of Prague. It’s no surprise it is
   bustling with tourists every time of day. Križovnický
   square, overlooking Charles Bridge with Prague Castle
   in the background, is probably the most beautiful
   square in the city. Its unique historical atmosphere
   of gothic houses and churches, cobblestone streets and
   squares, and stone towers blend together with the
   ...More
   modern era. A vast array of bars, restaurants, dance
   clubs, international brand shops, galleries and hotels
   bring life to the old city. With its charming and
   picturesque cobblestone streets, the nightlife and
   parties will surely be unforgettable.

   Stare Mesto (Old Town)
   One of the oldest neighbourhoods in town represents
   the medieval heart of Prague. It’s no surprise it is
   bustling with tourists every time of day. Križovnický
   square, overlooking Charles Bridge with Prague Castle
   in the background, is probably the most beautiful
   square in the city. Its unique historical atmosphere
   of gothic houses and churches, cobblestone streets and
   squares, and stone towers blend together with the
   ...More
   modern era. A vast array of bars, restaurants, dance
   clubs, international brand shops, galleries and hotels
   bring life to the old city. With its charming and
   picturesque cobblestone streets, the nightlife and
   parties will surely be unforgettable.

   Stare Mesto (Old Town)
   One of the oldest neighbourhoods in town represents
   the medieval heart of Prague. It’s no surprise it is
   bustling with tourists every time of day. Križovnický
   square, overlooking Charles Bridge with Prague Castle
   in the background, is probably the most beautiful
   square in the city. Its unique historical atmosphere
   of gothic houses and churches, cobblestone streets and
   squares, and stone towers blend together with the
   ...More
   modern era. A vast array of bars, restaurants, dance
   clubs, international brand shops, galleries and hotels
   bring life to the old city. With its charming and
   picturesque cobblestone streets, the nightlife and
   parties will surely be unforgettable.

   Exactly what you would expect

   Offers what you would hope for from an Irish bar, including some Irish
   staff!! Good portions and friendly service, though I'm not sure about
   being charged 4 euro for soda water from the tap!!

   Good Bar for Casual Dinner

   It was raining when we visited Prague for sightseeing. We saw this Bar
   and choose the outside tent. We love the warmth and atmosphere of the
   Bar. Inside the Bar, there’s live music. We ordered Fish and Chips, Hot
   Tea, seafood Pasta and Cappuccino.

   Stare Mesto (Old Town)
   One of the oldest neighbourhoods in town represents
   the medieval heart of Prague. It’s no surprise it is
   bustling with tourists every time of day. Križovnický
   square, overlooking Charles Bridge with Prague Castle
   in the background, is probably the most beautiful
   square in the city. Its unique historical atmosphere
   of gothic houses and churches, cobblestone streets and
   squares, and stone towers blend together with the
   ...More
   modern era. A vast array of bars, restaurants, dance
   clubs, international brand shops, galleries and hotels
   bring life to the old city. With its charming and
   picturesque cobblestone streets, the nightlife and
   parties will surely be unforgettable.

   Stare Mesto (Old Town)
   One of the oldest neighbourhoods in town represents
   the medieval heart of Prague. It’s no surprise it is
   bustling with tourists every time of day. Križovnický
   square, overlooking Charles Bridge with Prague Castle
   in the background, is probably the most beautiful
   square in the city. Its unique historical atmosphere
   of gothic houses and churches, cobblestone streets and
   squares, and stone towers blend together with the
   ...More
   modern era. A vast array of bars, restaurants, dance
   clubs, international brand shops, galleries and hotels
   bring life to the old city. With its charming and
   picturesque cobblestone streets, the nightlife and
   parties will surely be unforgettable.

   Wouldn't buy anywhere else!

   The woman that worked in the shop was so friendly and helpful and she
   lets you try on what ever you would like. The store has some
   information about the history of garnets and the Bohemian Garnets in
   particular. You receive a certificate of authenticity...More

   Such a rich color
   Review of: Entrance ticket to The Bohemian Garnet Museum Prague

   I love garnet for its dark rich color. We had to visit once I saw the
   museum on one of our walks. The exposition is wonderful and any fan
   will leave satisfied.

   Levelled sight

   You can't come to place or go to here, our visit was beautiful, the sun
   shone, it wasn't jam-packed.

   Muzeum

   Had a wonderful jail trip. The rides back and forth are fantastic, and
   it's very nice to see the it itself. The self-directed tours are
   actually making the trick.

   Stare Mesto (Old Town)
   One of the oldest neighbourhoods in town represents
   the medieval heart of Prague. It’s no surprise it is
   bustling with tourists every time of day. Križovnický
   square, overlooking Charles Bridge with Prague Castle
   in the background, is probably the most beautiful
   square in the city. Its unique historical atmosphere
   of gothic houses and churches, cobblestone streets and
   squares, and stone towers blend together with the
   ...More
   modern era. A vast array of bars, restaurants, dance
   clubs, international brand shops, galleries and hotels
   bring life to the old city. With its charming and
   picturesque cobblestone streets, the nightlife and
   parties will surely be unforgettable.
