   We have been ruled for years by archaic economic ideas, particularly
   the claim that a healthy dose of economic austerity is the best way to
   get the economy’s engines firing again. It is a zombie idea,
   discredited almost nine decades ago when Herbert Hoover insisted on
   balancing the budget during a crisis, and sent the economy into a
   tailspin. If bad ideas are not allowed to die, good ideas slip into
   obscurity. Today, one of those buried ideas is enjoying a well-deserved
   revival: basic income—the idea that every citizen is entitled to an
   income sufficient to cover basic needs.

   Ad Policy

   New assessments of basic income have cropped up in The New York Times,
   The New Yorker, The Wall Street Journal. It seems to be one of the few
   radical reform ideas that appeal to people on both ends of the
   political spectrum: The Koch brothers’ favorite think tank, the Cato
   Institute, has revisited the idea, and former SEIU head, Andy Stern,
   has written a book about it. Historically, market luminaries such as
   Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman, and Charles Murray have given
   rhetorical support to the idea because of their hostility to
   welfare-state programs (they hope to replace them with a basic income,
   though a punitively small one). Tech entrepreneurs have embraced basic
   income in anticipation of new waves of technological unemployment from
   robots and artificial intelligence. Those of us on the left, however,
   have a different vision of what basic income might achieve.

   A group of European intellectuals and activists created the Basic
   Income European Network-BIEN (later to become the Basic Income Earth
   Network) in 1986, dedicated to promoting universal guaranteed-income
   policies. Working tirelessly over 30 years, they have won endorsements
   for the basic income idea by trade unions, community groups, and
   political parties. Since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, support has
   exploded in Europe. Recently, 64 percent of respondents in a European
   wide poll said they would vote in favor of creating a basic income. One
   unexpected result of BIEN’s efforts was that political leaders in many
   middle-income countries such as Brazil, India, Mexico, and South Africa
   embraced the idea of basic income as a way of dealing with popular
   unrest. Across the globe, governments began to enact direct income
   supports to their poorest citizens. While none of these schemes amounts
   to a full basic-income system, cash transfers to the poor have proven
   to be a powerful weapon in reducing poverty. Perhaps as many as a
   billion people in the developing world are now receiving these cash
   transfers and the idea has been endorsed by the World Bank and powerful
   global charities. Studies have definitively shown that there is no
   truth to the right wing claims that giving poor people money
   demoralizes them; it does the opposite. Moreover, providing everyone
   with a basic income is an obvious way to make societies more resilient
   in the face of global climate change and it would slow the flow of
   refugees from economic hardship.

   In the United States, no matter how appealing basic income is,
   advocates face the problem of sticker shock. Implementing a generous
   basic income would require raising much more revenue through the tax
   system. This, of course, threatens the regrettable bipartisan consensus
   that there must be no increase in the tax burden on middle-income
   households. But, like other societies, we do not have to get to a basic
   income in one giant leap. An intermediate step would be to
   significantly transform the existing Earned Income Tax Credit into a
   full negative income tax that provided subsistence income to all poor
   households. (With a negative income tax, poor households receive a
   monthly or weekly check from the government rather than transferring
   funds to the government through tax withholding.) Because such a
   program is highly targeted, it could eliminate poverty completely for a
   net cost of $250 to $300 billion—much of which could be raised by
   establishing a financial transaction tax.

   Even this interim step would represent a big break from the mix of poor
   relief and social insurance on which Western nations have relied. But
   it would also be a step toward something more radical: decoupling money
   and work by giving money to everyone.

   For centuries, arrangements for poor relief have been shaped by the
   principle of “less eligibility.” The phrase was used by the English
   Poor Law Commissioners in 1834, and meant simply that people who
   depended on the notorious workhouses for public assistance must always
   suffer more than those workers who were not on public assistance. This
   same principle molds our social assistance policies to this day. Note
   that as real wages have fallen over the past decades, so too have the
   benefit levels of our contemporary poor-relief system, known as TANF or
   Temporary Assistance to Needy Families. The conditions of receiving
   even this meager stipend have become more arduous and more insulting,
   requiring that people submit to innumerable bureaucratic routines that
   teach the lesson that wage work, any wage work, is preferable to the
   dole.

   Simply put, wage work has become one of the most elemental pillars of
   our civic religion. It is not just an American religion, although
   Americans tend to be especially fierce devotees, but virtually a world
   religion. Remember the myth of the Garden of Eden, shared by all the
   Abrahamic creeds, Christian and Muslim and Jewish traditions alike.
   Once upon a time, the story goes, God was generous. He created Adam and
   Eve and gave them a garden of plenty in which to live. But although
   there were many trees with many fruits, they were tempted by the
   serpent and disobeyed God’s warning not to bite into the fruit of the
   tree of knowledge of good and evil. For this sin they were cast out of
   the garden and made to struggle for their subsistence. They had sinned,
   and so ever after they were made to work for their livelihood. Work is
   our punishment, the story goes, and our redemption.

   The myth explained the harsh reality of life for people who struggled
   over the millennia to survive in a subsistence economy. But the myth
   was also put to the service of dominant groups who wrested control of
   the fields, the forests, and the streams on which subsistence depended
   and then blamed the ensuing poverty on the poor themselves. Over time,
   many of the world’s people were not only cursed by the need to work;
   they also had to work for those who controlled the resources that
   turned labor into subsistence. They became workers for hire by the
   propertied, and the drudgery and the abuses of wage work now became the
   fate to which humankind was consigned for the sin in the Garden of
   Eden.

   Religious myth was not sufficient to ensure docility. People still
   rebelled. They took to the road as beggars or vagabonds; they escaped
   employment and joined the king’s army; they poached small game on the
   master’s land; or they simply starved or became ill and died on the
   steps of the homes of the better-off. And as markets in labor began to
   supplant arrangements that relied on law and tradition, as well as
   sheer destitution, to enforce work, the problem of regulating work
   grew. In response, an institutional arrangement was gradually devised
   in the late Middle Ages to enforce wage work. The institution came to
   be called poor relief.

   Poor relief and its successor programs are systems of assistance, but
   they are also systems of degradation. From the beginning, such programs
   gave meager assistance to those who turned to it, often conditioning
   rations of gruel on hard labor. And it also conditioned whatever
   assistance was provided on close monitoring of the behavior of the
   poor, and also on rituals of public humiliation. Adam and Eve were cast
   out of the Garden of Eden, and learned to be ashamed of their
   nakedness; the recipients of poor relief were cast out of the
   self-respecting community and made into a public spectacle. In medieval
   England paupers were branded, put in the stocks, tied to carts on
   market day. In the 20th-century United States they were castigated as
   “welfare queens” and made to don orange DayGlo vests while they picked
   up trash in the parks. When Bill Clinton called on voters to “end
   welfare as we know it,” he was drawing on that popular antipathy to
   people who are “dependent.”

   ____________________

   Not everyone will be on board to sever the age-old ties between poverty
   relief and tough demands on the poor. The basic-income approach will be
   resisted by employer interests because it violates that venerable
   principle, and will make workers more powerful over time by reducing
   their dependence on any one employer. A generous basic-income policy
   could, in other words, transform class relations.

   But there will also be popular resistance. In June, a Swiss referendum
   resulted in only 23 percent support for a nationwide basic income. This
   skepticism was not unique to that prosperous and fairly conservative
   nation. Basic income will generate resistance because of practical
   matters, like a rise in taxes. But even if those challenges are
   overcome, the reform will confront resistance because of the cultural
   upset it will generate. There will be deeper fears in play, not easily
   assuaged by wonkish arguments showing how the bills can be paid.

   Could it be that people are afraid of being freed from wage work, even
   from a portion of wage work? What would they do with their newfound
   free time? Watch television or play with their iPhone? A shorter work
   week, or no work week would make a rich leisure life possible, and it
   would make a dense social life possible. There would be time to invest
   in our communities, and time to care for one another, and especially to
   care for the young, the old, and the sick. But if the patterns of that
   leisure, the elements of that community, have become invisible to us,
   well, maybe everyone might as well go to work for whatever camaraderie
   the workplace provides.

   These fears are another reason that the debate over basic income has
   such extraordinary political potential. It is not just another reform;
   it is a proposal that makes us think about what it is we are here on
   earth to do. Both our civic religion and harsh economic necessity
   dictates that we must work in order to live—how else are we going to
   pay off those student loans? But when a tiny population of farmers can
   feed many millions and highly automated factories can churn out more
   cars and more consumer goods than people can afford to buy, what is the
   point of the tyranny of wage labor? And what precisely is the
   justification for the huge gap between the ostentatious wealth of the
   billionaires and the misery of those who can find only the most
   degraded forms of work? Basic income raises the big questions—what is
   an economy for, and why can’t we have one that serves the needs of
   everyone?

   We have been ruled for years by archaic economic ideas, particularly
   the claim that a healthy dose of economic austerity is the best way to
   get the economy’s engines firing again. It is a zombie idea,
   discredited almost nine decades ago when Herbert Hoover insisted on
   balancing the budget during a crisis, and sent the economy into a
   tailspin. If bad ideas are not allowed to die, good ideas slip into
   obscurity. Today, one of those buried ideas is enjoying a well-deserved
   revival: basic income—the idea that every citizen is entitled to an
   income sufficient to cover basic needs.

   Ad Policy

   New assessments of basic income have cropped up in The New York Times,
   The New Yorker, The Wall Street Journal. It seems to be one of the few
   radical reform ideas that appeal to people on both ends of the
   political spectrum: The Koch brothers’ favorite think tank, the Cato
   Institute, has revisited the idea, and former SEIU head, Andy Stern,
   has written a book about it. Historically, market luminaries such as
   Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman, and Charles Murray have given
   rhetorical support to the idea because of their hostility to
   welfare-state programs (they hope to replace them with a basic income,
   though a punitively small one). Tech entrepreneurs have embraced basic
   income in anticipation of new waves of technological unemployment from
   robots and artificial intelligence. Those of us on the left, however,
   have a different vision of what basic income might achieve.

   A group of European intellectuals and activists created the Basic
   Income European Network-BIEN (later to become the Basic Income Earth
   Network) in 1986, dedicated to promoting universal guaranteed-income
   policies. Working tirelessly over 30 years, they have won endorsements
   for the basic income idea by trade unions, community groups, and
   political parties. Since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, support has
   exploded in Europe. Recently, 64 percent of respondents in a European
   wide poll said they would vote in favor of creating a basic income. One
   unexpected result of BIEN’s efforts was that political leaders in many
   middle-income countries such as Brazil, India, Mexico, and South Africa
   embraced the idea of basic income as a way of dealing with popular
   unrest. Across the globe, governments began to enact direct income
   supports to their poorest citizens. While none of these schemes amounts
   to a full basic-income system, cash transfers to the poor have proven
   to be a powerful weapon in reducing poverty. Perhaps as many as a
   billion people in the developing world are now receiving these cash
   transfers and the idea has been endorsed by the World Bank and powerful
   global charities. Studies have definitively shown that there is no
   truth to the right wing claims that giving poor people money
   demoralizes them; it does the opposite. Moreover, providing everyone
   with a basic income is an obvious way to make societies more resilient
   in the face of global climate change and it would slow the flow of
   refugees from economic hardship.

   In the United States, no matter how appealing basic income is,
   advocates face the problem of sticker shock. Implementing a generous
   basic income would require raising much more revenue through the tax
   system. This, of course, threatens the regrettable bipartisan consensus
   that there must be no increase in the tax burden on middle-income
   households. But, like other societies, we do not have to get to a basic
   income in one giant leap. An intermediate step would be to
   significantly transform the existing Earned Income Tax Credit into a
   full negative income tax that provided subsistence income to all poor
   households. (With a negative income tax, poor households receive a
   monthly or weekly check from the government rather than transferring
   funds to the government through tax withholding.) Because such a
   program is highly targeted, it could eliminate poverty completely for a
   net cost of $250 to $300 billion—much of which could be raised by
   establishing a financial transaction tax.

   Even this interim step would represent a big break from the mix of poor
   relief and social insurance on which Western nations have relied. But
   it would also be a step toward something more radical: decoupling money
   and work by giving money to everyone.

   For centuries, arrangements for poor relief have been shaped by the
   principle of “less eligibility.” The phrase was used by the English
   Poor Law Commissioners in 1834, and meant simply that people who
   depended on the notorious workhouses for public assistance must always
   suffer more than those workers who were not on public assistance. This
   same principle molds our social assistance policies to this day. Note
   that as real wages have fallen over the past decades, so too have the
   benefit levels of our contemporary poor-relief system, known as TANF or
   Temporary Assistance to Needy Families. The conditions of receiving
   even this meager stipend have become more arduous and more insulting,
   requiring that people submit to innumerable bureaucratic routines that
   teach the lesson that wage work, any wage work, is preferable to the
   dole.

   Simply put, wage work has become one of the most elemental pillars of
   our civic religion. It is not just an American religion, although
   Americans tend to be especially fierce devotees, but virtually a world
   religion. Remember the myth of the Garden of Eden, shared by all the
   Abrahamic creeds, Christian and Muslim and Jewish traditions alike.
   Once upon a time, the story goes, God was generous. He created Adam and
   Eve and gave them a garden of plenty in which to live. But although
   there were many trees with many fruits, they were tempted by the
   serpent and disobeyed God’s warning not to bite into the fruit of the
   tree of knowledge of good and evil. For this sin they were cast out of
   the garden and made to struggle for their subsistence. They had sinned,
   and so ever after they were made to work for their livelihood. Work is
   our punishment, the story goes, and our redemption.

   The myth explained the harsh reality of life for people who struggled
   over the millennia to survive in a subsistence economy. But the myth
   was also put to the service of dominant groups who wrested control of
   the fields, the forests, and the streams on which subsistence depended
   and then blamed the ensuing poverty on the poor themselves. Over time,
   many of the world’s people were not only cursed by the need to work;
   they also had to work for those who controlled the resources that
   turned labor into subsistence. They became workers for hire by the
   propertied, and the drudgery and the abuses of wage work now became the
   fate to which humankind was consigned for the sin in the Garden of
   Eden.

   Religious myth was not sufficient to ensure docility. People still
   rebelled. They took to the road as beggars or vagabonds; they escaped
   employment and joined the king’s army; they poached small game on the
   master’s land; or they simply starved or became ill and died on the
   steps of the homes of the better-off. And as markets in labor began to
   supplant arrangements that relied on law and tradition, as well as
   sheer destitution, to enforce work, the problem of regulating work
   grew. In response, an institutional arrangement was gradually devised
   in the late Middle Ages to enforce wage work. The institution came to
   be called poor relief.

   Poor relief and its successor programs are systems of assistance, but
   they are also systems of degradation. From the beginning, such programs
   gave meager assistance to those who turned to it, often conditioning
   rations of gruel on hard labor. And it also conditioned whatever
   assistance was provided on close monitoring of the behavior of the
   poor, and also on rituals of public humiliation. Adam and Eve were cast
   out of the Garden of Eden, and learned to be ashamed of their
   nakedness; the recipients of poor relief were cast out of the
   self-respecting community and made into a public spectacle. In medieval
   England paupers were branded, put in the stocks, tied to carts on
   market day. In the 20th-century United States they were castigated as
   “welfare queens” and made to don orange DayGlo vests while they picked
   up trash in the parks. When Bill Clinton called on voters to “end
   welfare as we know it,” he was drawing on that popular antipathy to
   people who are “dependent.”

   ____________________

   [BUTTON Input] (not implemented)_________

   Not everyone will be on board to sever the age-old ties between poverty
   relief and tough demands on the poor. The basic-income approach will be
   resisted by employer interests because it violates that venerable
   principle, and will make workers more powerful over time by reducing
   their dependence on any one employer. A generous basic-income policy
   could, in other words, transform class relations.

   But there will also be popular resistance. In June, a Swiss referendum
   resulted in only 23 percent support for a nationwide basic income. This
   skepticism was not unique to that prosperous and fairly conservative
   nation. Basic income will generate resistance because of practical
   matters, like a rise in taxes. But even if those challenges are
   overcome, the reform will confront resistance because of the cultural
   upset it will generate. There will be deeper fears in play, not easily
   assuaged by wonkish arguments showing how the bills can be paid.

   Could it be that people are afraid of being freed from wage work, even
   from a portion of wage work? What would they do with their newfound
   free time? Watch television or play with their iPhone? A shorter work
   week, or no work week would make a rich leisure life possible, and it
   would make a dense social life possible. There would be time to invest
   in our communities, and time to care for one another, and especially to
   care for the young, the old, and the sick. But if the patterns of that
   leisure, the elements of that community, have become invisible to us,
   well, maybe everyone might as well go to work for whatever camaraderie
   the workplace provides.

   These fears are another reason that the debate over basic income has
   such extraordinary political potential. It is not just another reform;
   it is a proposal that makes us think about what it is we are here on
   earth to do. Both our civic religion and harsh economic necessity
   dictates that we must work in order to live—how else are we going to
   pay off those student loans? But when a tiny population of farmers can
   feed many millions and highly automated factories can churn out more
   cars and more consumer goods than people can afford to buy, what is the
   point of the tyranny of wage labor? And what precisely is the
   justification for the huge gap between the ostentatious wealth of the
   billionaires and the misery of those who can find only the most
   degraded forms of work? Basic income raises the big questions—what is
   an economy for, and why can’t we have one that serves the needs of
   everyone?
