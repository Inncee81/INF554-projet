   Nous avons le plaisir de vous annoncer la disponibilité des Questions
   Twitter en France. D’ici quelques jours et en quelques clics, les
   utilisateurs pourront interroger leurs followers sur les sujets qui
   leur tiennent à cœur.

   Il n’existe pas de meilleure plateforme que Twitter pour obtenir des
   réponses instantanées et sur mesure. Choisissez ce sur quoi vous
   souhaitez interroger votre communauté, par exemple : comment appeler
   votre chien? qui va gagner le match de ce soir? quel sujet politique
   les intéresse le plus?

     https://twitter.com/TwitterFrance/status/656835648943316993

   Pour tous les utilisateurs de Twitter, c’est une nouvelle manière de
   s’engager auprès de sa communauté et de comprendre précisément les
   attentes ou l’opinion du public. Et pour les participants, c’est une
   façon très simple de se faire entendre en toute anonymat.

   Auparavant, il était déjà possible de poser des questions sur Twitter
   de différentes manières - Tweeter des questions et suivre les réponses,
   faire un décompte d’utilisation de hashtags de vote, ou demander aux
   utilisateurs de mettre en favoris vs. Retweeter pour donner leur
   opinion. Bientôt, vous pourrez créer votre propre Question à double
   choix, directement depuis une fenêtre dédiée, et celle-ci sera
   disponible en ligne pendant 24 heures. Vous pourrez également donner
   votre opinion en toute confidentialité sur les Questions des autres
   utilisateurs.

   Les "Questions" Twitter arrivent en France

   Au cours des prochains jours, nous vous permettrons de créer une
   Question sur iOs, Android, et sur Twitter.com, grâce une icône dédiée
   en bas de votre écran.
     __________________________________________________________________

   MISE A JOUR : Vous pouvez maintenant proposer jusqu’à 4 options de
   réponses à une Questions Twitter.

An easier way to save and share Tweets

   By Jesar Shah
   Wednesday, 28 February 2018
   Link copied successfully

   From articles and threads to videos and GIFs, timelines are packed with
   Tweets that you don't always have time to fully explore in the moment.
   You’ve told us you want to save them for later.

   Hello, Bookmarks!

   Today, we’re introducing Bookmarks, an easy way to save Tweets for
   quick access later. But wait, there’s more! Today’s update makes
   sharing better, too. With our new “share” icon on every Tweet, you’ll
   be able to bookmark a Tweet, share via Direct Message, or share off of
   Twitter any number of ways. Because we put all sharing actions together
   in one place, it’s easier to save and share privately or publicly — in
   the moment, or later.

   How It Works

   To bookmark a Tweet, tap the share icon under the Tweet and select,
   “Add Tweet to Bookmarks”. To find it later, tap “Bookmarks” from your
   profile icon menu. You can remove Tweets from your Bookmarks at any
   time. Also, only you can see what you’ve bookmarked. Learn more about
   how to bookmark in our Help Center.

   Bookmarks help people keep up with the best of Twitter. You can save a
   Tweet with a live morning show like Buzzfeed’s #AM2DM to watch at
   another time, bookmark a thread from @Lin_Manuel about new Hamilton
   music to come back to, and save Tweets with links to interesting
   articles for later reading or sharing. You’ll no doubt show us more
   creative uses for Bookmarks than we ever imagined! (You have a tendency
   to do that on Twitter.)

   Better Because of Your Feedback

   We Tweeted ongoing updates as we built Bookmarks so we could
   incorporate your input as we worked. By working this way, we learned
   that you like to save replies so you can answer later and that you may
   share a Tweet hours or days later after you’ve bookmarked it. Thank you
   for being part of this process — your feedback was valuable in building
   this update, and it made it all the more fun for us as we built a new
   feature for you. As a result, we all have an easier way to save, share,
   and stay informed.

   Bookmarks are now rolling out globally on Twitter for iOS and Android,
   Twitter Lite, and mobile.twitter.com. Thanks for your collaboration to
   make Bookmarks happen. Happy bookmarking!

Tweeting Made Easier

   By Aliza Rosen
   Tuesday, 7 November 2017
   Link copied successfully

   In September, we launched a test that expanded the 140 character limit
   so every person around the world could express themselves easily in a
   Tweet. Our goal was to make this possible while ensuring we keep the
   speed and brevity that makes Twitter, Twitter. Looking at all the data,
   we’re excited to share we’ve achieved this goal and are rolling the
   change out to all languages where cramming was an issue.*

   During the first few days of the test many people Tweeted the full 280
   limit because it was new and novel, but soon after behavior normalized
   (more on this below). We saw when people needed to use more than 140
   characters, they Tweeted more easily and more often. But importantly,
   people Tweeted below 140 most of the time and the brevity of Twitter
   remained.

   Highlights are below and in our additional blogs about our
   experimentation process, extensive data analysis, research, and design
   work.

   Easier to Tweet

   Historically, 9% of Tweets in English hit the character limit. This
   reflects the challenge of fitting a thought into a Tweet, often
   resulting in lots of time spent editing and even at times abandoning
   Tweets before sending. With the expanded character count, this problem
   was massively reduced – that number dropped to only 1% of Tweets
   running up against the limit. Since we saw Tweets hit the character
   limit less often, we believe people spent less time editing their
   Tweets in the composer. This shows that more space makes it easier for
   people to fit thoughts in a Tweet, so they could say what they want to
   say, and send Tweets faster than before. You can see this happening in
   the graph below.

   Keeping Twitter’s brevity

   We – and many of you – were concerned that timelines may fill up with
   280 character Tweets, and people with the new limit would always use up
   the whole space. But that didn’t happen. Only 5% of Tweets sent were
   longer than 140 characters and only 2% were over 190 characters. As a
   result, your timeline reading experience should not substantially
   change, you’ll still see about the same amount of Tweets in your
   timeline. For reference, in the timeline, Tweets with an image or poll
   usually take up more space than a 190 character Tweet.

   It’s worth emphasizing again that people in the test got very excited
   about the extra space in the beginning and many Tweets went way beyond
   140. People did silly (creative!) things like writing just a few
   characters per line to make their Tweets extra large. It was a
   temporary effect and didn’t last long. We expect to see some of this
   novelty effect spike again with this week’s launch and expect it to
   resume to normal behavior soon after.

   Engagement

   In addition to more Tweeting, people who had more room to Tweet
   received more engagement (Likes, Retweets, @mentions), got more
   followers, and spent more time on Twitter. People in the experiment
   told us that a higher character limit made them feel more satisfied
   with how they expressed themselves on Twitter, their ability to find
   good content, and Twitter overall.

   We are making this change after listening and observing a problem our
   global community was having (it wasn’t easy enough to Tweet!), studying
   data to understand how we could improve, trying it out, and listening
   to your feedback. We’ll continue listening and working to make Twitter
   easier for everyone while making sure we keep what you love.

   *Japanese, Korean, and Chinese will continue to have 140 characters
   because cramming is not an issue in these languages. In fact, these
   languages have always been able to say more with their Tweets because
   of the density of their writing systems. We shared more about this
   thinking and our research here.

   **On this graph, there is a small bump in the red line (which
   represents the group with 280 characters) at 140 because these people
   were also using older Twitter clients which didn’t have the ability to
   send longer Tweets, so they continued to hit the 140 character limit.
   This graph is for English-only Tweets.
