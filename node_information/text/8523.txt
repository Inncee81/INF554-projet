   Embedded Player Can you discover an emotion? We travel to the jungles
   of the Philippines where an anthropologist named Renato Rosaldo lived
   with the Ilongots, an isolated tribe of headhunters. There he learns
   about legit, an emotion so intense, and varied, and scary to him, that
   he can't really map onto the usual palette of American emotions. It
   takes many years, and a shocking and tragic event, for Rosaldo to fully
   grasp legut. Then we follow a young woman who does something on dates
   that virtually guarantees their failure. Along the way , she gains
   insight into her own emotions, and those of a generation of kids raised
   to be happy.
