   She‚Äôd still grab the leash and drag me out the door to try and walk me,
   but by a few blocks she was slowing down and I‚Äôd scoop her up for the
   last block. It‚Äôs why I bought her a stroller, so she could still enjoy
   longer adventures without losing steam. I would‚Äôve done anything, given
   every last dollar I had, traded my limbs to give her the best life
   possible. She was my baby, and I‚Äôll always ask myself what else I
   could‚Äôve done. We never got to the point where she didn‚Äôt want to play
   or eat or run around, so I thought we had more time. But I‚Äôm grateful
   that the last two weeks of Miku‚Äôs life were spent with the people and
   animals she loved most, on new and familiar adventures alike, still
   running and unicorning and doing spins and being so, so silly. She had
   her first adventure at Disney World. She rolled in the grass with her
   little doggy cousins and basked in the Florida sun. I took umpteen
   videos of her snoozing with her daddy, and she sneaked her food bag
   open to have a quiet snack while I was sleeping on our car ride home.
   She visited her favorite vet Dr. Maddon and seemed to be in a good
   place. And just two days before we had to say goodbye, we took her to a
   farm for pumpkin and apple picking. She kept climbing on her Aunt
   Amanda‚Äôs lap to get a better view out of the car window on the way
   home. We had such a beautiful day together, and then the very next
   morning everything changed. I knew she wasn‚Äôt okay and rushed her to
   the hospital, not knowing we wouldn‚Äôt be leaving. I never wanted her
   last moments to be in a hospital‚Äîit was one of my biggest fears‚Äîand I
   wish Eternal Sunshine were real, because I‚Äôd do anything to erase those
   last 24 hours from my memory and hang on tight to every good moment
   before. I want to say so much more. I want to talk about all of the
   good things, share all of the funny moments,‚Äîand I will‚Äîbut right now
   I‚Äôm just too broken. All I can think of is how much I want my Miku.
   Instagram post 2149877084957560448_9499855 On Wednesday of last week,
   we had to say goodbye to Miku. It was the most heartbreaking day of my
   life. She was my world. Those who know me in real life know how much of
   me she took with her. But honestly, you could take one look at this
   page and see how much she meant to me. I hope. She was my baby for 15
   1/2 years. It sounds like a lot‚Äîpeople would gasp when they heard her
   age‚Äîbut I just kept hoping she would defy the odds and live at least a
   few more years. Or if miracles existed, forever. How could I‚Äîthe girl
   who woke multiple times in the night to check her breathing, who cried
   every time ‚ÄúBaby Mine‚Äù came on because it was my song to her, who
   teared up just watching her sleep or tilt her head while I talked to
   her--survive without her? I still don‚Äôt know. I feel like all of the
   light has gone out of me. I know most of you never actually met Miku,
   but throughout the years I hope her photos and videos made you smile. I
   hope she made you want to adopt a dog and give them the life and love
   she had. She was the most loved dog in the world; I hope she knew that.
   Miku was the happiest and purest being I have ever known: always tap
   dancing and doing ballerina and circus moves, unicorning (that‚Äôs what
   we called her graceful leaps) over anything that could be jumped,
   giving kisses. Even at 15 she was still so silly, so sweet, so full of
   life and personality. I hated that I had to keep her from doing zoomies
   all the time, for fear it‚Äôd be too much for her heart and lungs. I
   walked a fine line between helicopter mom on high alert for potential
   health hazards and trying to give her the fullest, most adventurous and
   happy life she deserved. As her age progressed, more and more ailments
   popped up and she had so many specialists, we seemed to live in vet
   offices. But she was still so full of energy even two days before we
   lost her, so it was a horrible shock. I know she was gradually slowing
   down. I can see that especially now, as I torture myself by watching
   every video I have of her. Though she was still so sprightly, it was
   more contained‚Äîbursts of playfulness instead of marathons. (Cont‚Äôd in
   next post)
   Instagram post 2146626991659937129_9499855 I put a lot of emphasis on
   skin care so that I feel confident without makeup. I love makeup, but
   it‚Äôs never about hiding beneath a mask for me! @lovephilosophy sent
   their renewed hope in a jar water cream for me to try out, and though
   I‚Äôm very familiar with the famed original, THIS formula is the one for
   me. The texture feels like snow, melts into your skin beautifully, with
   no greasy or heavy film. It‚Äôs gorgeous and ultra hydrating. I rotate
   moisturizers and treatments depending on my skin‚Äôs needs, but with
   hyaluronic acid, Norwegian glacier water, and brightening pineapple
   extract, this is one for all occasions. #hydratewithhope

   Instagram post 2145388727355376440_9499855 Have you been following my
   #30wears challenge with @downy? Here‚Äôs a roundup of all 30 ways I wore
   one shirt. This was one of my favorite partnerships to date, because it
   felt tailor made for me. Wardrobe remixing is how so many of us
   started‚Äîjust making outfits of what we already had in our closet,
   wearing things over and over in reimagined ways‚Äîand I‚Äôve already been
   looking forward to my next challenge. I hope this motivated some of you
   to take a second look at the pieces in your closet and think how many
   different ways you can wear them and how to wash them better! Thank you
   so much to @downy for this fun challenge, and for keeping my vintage
   cotton shirt looking newer, longer. You‚Äôd never know it was worn more
   than 30 times in the past few months! You can always refer back to my
   highlights to see all 30 outfits, and check out my blog post on
   keikolynn.com for a full recap. #downypartner #washitbetterloveitlonger

   this plaid jacket, sweater tank, denim skirt, and ankle boots from
