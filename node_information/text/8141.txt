Google, Ford, Uber launch coalition to further self-driving cars

   David Shepardson

   WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s Google unit (GOOGL.O), Ford Motor
   Co (F.N), the ride-sharing service Uber [UBER.UL] and two other
   companies said on Tuesday they are forming a coalition to push for
   federal action to help speed self-driving cars to market.

   Sweden-based Volvo Cars, which is owned by China’s Zhejiang Geely
   Holding Group Co GEELY.UL, and Uber rival Lyft also are part of the
   Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets. The group said in a statement
   it will “work with lawmakers, regulators and the public to realize the
   safety and societal benefits of self-driving vehicles.”

   The coalition said David Strickland, the former top official of the
   U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the top
   U.S. auto safety agency that is writing new guidance on self-driving
   cars, will be the coalition’s counsel and spokesman.

   “What people are looking for is clear rules of the road of what needs
   to be done for (fully autonomous) vehicles to be on the road,”
   Strickland said in an interview Tuesday, emphasizing the companies want
   to deploy them safely. “Nobody wants to take a shortcut on this.”

   Strickland, who has advised Google on self-driving car issues, said the
   group is “a full policy and messaging campaign and movement” and not
   just about lobbying lawmakers or regulators.

   In 2014 there were 32,675 fatalities and 2.3 million injured in 6.1
   million crashes on U.S. roads. NHTSA says about 94 percent of all
   traffic crashes are caused by human error.

   On Wednesday, NHTSA is holding the second of two public forums on its
   self-driving car guidelines that will feature comments from tech
   companies and automakers at Stanford University.

   NHTSA did not immediately return a message seeking comment on the
   coalition.

   Ford said in a statement the group will “work together to advocate for
   policy solutions that will support the deployment of fully autonomous
   vehicles.”

   NHTSA hopes to release its guidance to states, policymakers and
   companies on self-driving vehicles in July.

   California has proposed barring self-driving cars that do not have
   steering wheels, pedals and a licensed driver ready to take over in an
   emergency, which Google has opposed. Under current regulations, fully
   autonomous vehicles without human controls are not legal.

   NHTSA Administrator Mark Rosekind has said policymakers should avoid a
   “patchwork” of state regulations on self-driving cars but has not taken
   a position on California’s proposal.

   In February, NHTSA said the artificial intelligence system piloting a
   self-driving Google car could be considered the driver under federal
   law, a major step toward winning approval for autonomous vehicles.

   The five companies, which all are working on self-driving cars, say one
   of the group’s first tasks is to “work with civic organizations,
   municipalities and businesses to bring the vision of self-driving
   vehicles to America’s roads and highways.”

Cameroon probes video showing security forces apparently executing civilians

   Josiane Kouagheu

   4 Min Read

   YAOUNDE (Reuters) - Cameroon’s government said on Friday it would
   investigate a video that Amnesty International said shows security
   forces shooting at least a dozen unarmed people in the far north of the
   country, where they are battling Islamist militants.

   It also announced the arrests of seven soldiers in connection with a
   separate video that surfaced last month appearing to show men in
   military uniform shooting dead two women and two children.

   Amnesty said in a statement it had verified the latest video through
   witness testimony, satellite imagery and analysis of the weapons,
   dialogue and uniforms. It said the video was shot in the village of
   Achigaya at an unknown date prior to May 2016.

   The nearly four-minute video has circulated on social media in recent
   days. A government spokesman said it was released to undermine
   President Paul Biya ahead of an election in October.

   At the start of the video, several men in military fatigues with
   automatic-style weapons joke among themselves, with one saying in
   French: “This is a kamikaze mission.”

   The men then open fire for roughly 12 seconds on about a dozen people
   sitting or lying down against a wall and under guard.

   After the firing stops, one of the armed men approaches the motionless
   bodies and fires several more times from point-blank range. Around
   them, several buildings in the village are in flames and gunfire can be
   heard in the background.

   “Here is yet more credible evidence to support the allegations that
   Cameroon’s armed forces have committed grave crimes against civilians,”
   said Ilaria Allegrozzi, Amnesty International’s Lake Chad Researcher.

   Government spokesman Issa Tchiroma Bakary said authorities would open
   an investigation into the video but the government was the victim of a
   “campaign of denigration” before the election, when Biya will try to
   extend his 36-year rule.

   “People want to discredit the army and president,” Tchiroma told
   Reuters.

SOLDIERS ARRESTED

   Tchiroma announced later on Friday in a statement that authorities had
   arrested seven soldiers, including a lieutenant and a sergeant, in
   connection with the previous video.

   The statement did not say when the arrests occurred. Reuters reported
   on July 19, citing security sources, that four soldiers had been
   arrested over the video — information that authorities later disputed.

   “The Minister of Communication reiterates the Head of State’s resolve
   to ensure that the atrocities that may be committed by a few misguided
   soldiers are systematically investigated and, if need be, appropriate
   actions meted out,” it said.

   Government and army officials had previously dismissed that video as
   “fake news” meant to tarnish the government’s image, even as they
   promised to investigate.

   The Cameroonian army’s elite Rapid Intervention Brigade (BIR) has been
   battling Nigerian militant group Boko Haram in the country’s extreme
   north since late 2014.

   Since then, the militants have killed hundreds of people in the Far
   North and their tactics have included the use of child suicide bombers
   to attack checkpoints, market places and mosques.

Turkish central bank dismisses chief economist, department managers

   Nevzat Devranoglu

   4 Min Read

   ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey’s central bank has dismissed its chief
   economist, Hakan Kara, and some department managers, according to a
   document seen by Reuters, re-igniting concern about political
   interference in the institution one month after the sacking of its
   governor.
   [?m=02&amp;d=20190809&amp;t=2&amp;i=1417100565&amp;r=LYNXNPEF780ER&amp;
   w=20]

   entrance of the bank's headquarters in Ankara, Turkey April 19, 2015.

   The decision was part of a reorganization to make the bank more
   effective, according to the document, and was taken at an internal bank
   meeting. It followed comments from President Tayyip Erdogan in July
   that the bank needed to be overhauled.

   Also dismissed were the bank’s research and monetary policy general
   manager, Pinar Ozlu; markets general manager Orhan Kandar; and banking
   and financial institutions general manager Yavuz Yeter, the document
   showed. Kara and the general managers were all given the role of
   advisers.

   “This move will further weigh on concerns around erosion of (the
   bank’s) institutional strength,” said Timothy Ash, head of emerging
   market research at Blue Bay Asset Management.

   Kara was the backbone of the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey
   research efforts and “the face of the CBRT for investors for almost two
   decades”, Ash said, adding his dismissal was a greater loss than the
   sacking of former governor Murat Cetinkaya.

   The document did not identify a new chief economist, but named several
   people as being appointed to fill vacancies in the bank’s economics
   team after the changes. More than 10 people were dismissed in total.

   The lira TRYTOM=D3 stood at 5.4970 against the dollar at 0830 GMT,
   weakening from a close on Thursday of 5.4700.

SHARP RATE CUT

   The document said the reorganization was carried out to facilitate “the
   effective performance of duties, the effective management of operations
   and the clear definition of departments areas of responsibility.”

   Last September, Governor Cetinkaya raised interest rates by 625 basis
   points to stem a currency crisis. Rates remained at 24% this year,
   preventing further losses in Turkey’s lira but helping push the economy
   into recession.

   He was sacked last month by Erdogan, who said he failed to follow
   instructions on interest rates and the bank had not properly fulfilled
   its role.

   Erdogan has often expressed the unorthodox view that inflation will
   come down when interest rates are lowered, adding that he expects
   stronger economic recovery in the second half of the year.

   At its first meeting under it new governor, Murat Uysal, this month,
   the bank’s monetary policy committee slashed its key interest rate by
   425 basis points to 19.75%.

   The bank cited improving inflation in its decision to cut rates and
   said its stance remained cautious. Inflation rose to a 15-year high
   above 25% last year, prompting the aggressive rate increases, but has
   dropped to 16.65% as of July.

   Erdogan, who has called interest rates the “mother of all evil”, has
   repeatedly called for lower borrowing costs to boost the economy, which
   shrank 2.6% in the first quarter, after a 30% lira slide last year amid
   soaring inflation.

   He first signaled moves to reorganize the bank in comments to reporters
   last month, saying Turkey could face serious problems if its central
   bank were not completely overhauled.

   JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel called on Monday for its arch-foe Iran to
   be denied any military presence in Syria, after Russia said Damascus’
   forces alone should control Syrian territory near the Israeli and
   Jordanian borders.

   “Our position on Syria is clear,” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
   told his parliamentary faction in broadcast remarks. “We believe that
   there is no place for any Iranian military presence, anywhere in
   Syria.”
