VIA CenTaur Develops a Multi-core x86 Processor for Enterprise with in-built
AI Hardware

   by


    btarunr

   Today, 04:10 Discuss (9 Comments)
   Tasting Intel's blood in the water with AMD's return to
   competitiveness, dormant x86 licensee VIA wants to take another swing
   at the market, this time with a multi-core processor targeted at
   enterprises and possibly workstations, developed by its subsidiary
   CenTaur. The company appears to want to cash in on the AI boom, and
   could develop turnkey facial-recognition CCTV solutions with the chip.
   CenTaur is ready with a working prototype. It features eight 64-bit x86
   CPU cores, and an on-die "AI co-processor" named NCORE. A ringbus
   connects the eight CPU cores and the NCORE with the processor's other
   components. The processor features 16 MB of shared L3 cache, a
   quad-channel DDR4-3200 memory interface, and a 44-lane PCI-Express gen
   3.0 root-complex, along with a fully integrated southbridge, making it
   an SoC. It also appears to be multi-socket capable, although VIA didn't
   detail the interconnect in use.
   The NCORE is a PCI-mapped device to the software, which provides
   functions such as DNN building and training acceleration. From the
   looks of it, there's more to NCORE than simply a fixed-function
   hardware that multiplies matrices. Its developers state that the device
   accelerates AI at a rate of "20 trillion AI operations/sec with 20
   terabytes/sec memory bandwidth." The CPU cores on the processor tick at
   2.50 GHz, and while VIA hasn't made any IPC claims, it has mentioned
   support for the cutting-edge AVX-512 instruction-set, something even
   "Zen 2" lacks, which possibly indicates a powerful FPU. The silicon
   measures 195 mm², and has been built on 16 nm FinFET node at TSMC. VIA
   will demonstrate the unnamed processor and its testbed at ISC East
   2019, held on November 20 and 21.
   The full technology announcement slide-deck follows.

   Yesterday, 15:28 Discuss (28 Comments)
   DeepCool rolled out the GH-01, a graphics card reinforcement stand that
   you install inside your tower-type case, to minimize PCB bending over
   time (a vastly exaggerated phenomenon). But wait, it does more: the
   stand has an RGB LED embellishment along its length, and has space to
   route your graphics card's power cables. Up to two 8-pin PCIe power
   cables can be routed. You use a thumb-screw and notches to adjust the
   GH-01's VGA support height from 47.2 mm to 154 mm. The stand itself
   measures 52.6 mm x 60.6 mm x 163.73 mm (WxDxH). It can bear a load of
   up to 5 kg. There are two sub-variants of the GH-01 based on the
   illumination type. The GH-01 RGB uses old-school RGB lighting through
   12 V 4-pin RGB control. The GH-01 LED, on the other hand, uses more
   modern 5 V addressable-RGB over a 3-pin connector. The company didn't
   reveal pricing.

HP Rejects Acquisition Offer from Xerox

   Yesterday, 15:15 Discuss (23 Comments)
   On Sunday, HP Inc. released a letter from its board of directors
   stating that it rejects acquisition offer from Xerox Corporation
   pointing out that: "We have great confidence in our strategy and our
   ability to execute to continue driving sustainable long-term value at
   HP. In addition, the Board and management team continue to take actions
   to enhance shareholder value including the deployment of our strong
   balance sheet for increased repurchases of our significantly
   undervalued stock and for value-creating M&A."
   This decision shows a strong will from the folks over at HP to continue
   their business in the way they usually done for many years.
   Additionally, HP stated the following: "We recognize the potential
   benefits of consolidation, and we are open to exploring whether there
   is value to be created for HP shareholders through a potential
   combination with Xerox. However, as we have previously shared in
   connection with our prior requests for diligence, we have fundamental
   questions that need to be addressed in our diligence of Xerox. We note
   the decline of Xerox's revenue from $10.2 billion to $9.2 billion (on a
   trailing 12-month basis) since June 2018, which raises significant
   questions for us regarding the trajectory of your business and future
   prospects.", showing the downsides of the potential merger and
   questioning abilities of Xerox to manage two companies.

MATLAB MKL Codepath Tweak Boosts AMD Ryzen MKL Performance Significantly

   by


    btarunr

   Yesterday, 10:53 Discuss (48 Comments)
   MATLAB is a popular math computing environment in use by engineering
   firms, universities, and other research institutes. Some of its
   operations can be made to leverage Intel MKL (Math Kernel Library),
   which is poorly optimized for, and notoriously slow on AMD Ryzen
   processors. Reddit user Nedflanders1976 devised a way to restore
   anywhere between 20 to 300 percent performance on Ryzen and Ryzen
   Threadripper processors, by forcing MATLAB to use advanced
   instruction-sets such as AVX2. By default, MKL queries your processor's
   vendor ID string, and if it sees anything other than "GenuineIntel...,"
   it falls back to SSE, posing a significant performance disadvantage to
   "AuthenticAMD" Ryzen processors that have a full IA SSE4, AVX, and AVX2
   implementation.
   The tweak, meant to be manually applied by AMD Ryzen users, forces MKL
   to use AVX2 regardless of the CPU Vendor ID query result. The tweak is
   as simple as it is powerful. A simple 4-line Windows batch file with a
   set of arguments starts MKL in AVX2 mode. You can also make the tweak
   "permanent" by creating a system environment variable. The environment
   variable will apply to all instances of MATLAB, and not just those
   spawned by the batch file. Nedflanders1976 also posted a benchmark
   script that highlights the performance impact of AVX2, however you can
   use your own scripts and post results.

Desktop AMD Radeon RX 5300 XT Rears its Head in HP Specs Sheet

   by


    btarunr

   Yesterday, 07:32 Discuss (8 Comments)
   A desktop variant of the AMD Radeon RX 5300 XT graphics card surfaced
   in a specs sheet of an upcoming HP Pavilion desktop model
   (TP01-0004ng). The listing describes the RX 5300 XT as featuring 4 GB
   of GDDR5 memory. This is the first instance of an RX 5300 XT in the
   wild. An older report citing driver files pointed to there being only
   two RX 5300-series products, the RX 5300 (desktop), and the mobile RX
   5300M. The "XT" brand extension could denote a higher CU count than the
   RX 5300, although the series is still differentiated from the RX
   5500-series with cheaper GDDR5 memory.
   The RX 5300 series and RX 5500 series are based on a common silicon,
   the 7 nm "Navi 14," featuring up to 24 RDNA compute units (up to 1,536
   stream processors), and a 128-bit wide memory interface that supports
   up to 8 GB of GDDR6 or GDDR5 memory. AMD hopes to phase out its 14 nm
   and 12 nm "Polaris 10" and "Polaris 30" chips with "Navi 14." It's
   possible that the RX 5300 XT is OEM-only, just like the other key
   component in this HP desktop, the Ryzen 5 3500 6-core/6-thread
   processor.

   For those wanting 802.11ax Wi-Fi 6 on their desktops without an M.2
   E-key slot on their motherboards, ASUS came up with the PCE-AX3000, a
   low-profile capable (half-height) NIC that provides up to 3000 Mbps
   (2.4 Gbps over 5 GHz and 600 Mbps over 2.4 GHz) wireless connectivity,
   and the added convenience of Bluetooth 5.0 for short-range
   communications. A set of MU-MIMO antennae come included. Besides
   MU-MIMO, the card supports OFDMA for better collision-prevention with
   other devices in the same channel, and WPA3 security protocol. The NIC
   is essentially a PCI-Express 3.0 x1 add-on card with an M.2 E-key slot
   that holds an Intel AX200 "Cyclone Peak" WLAN card. We expect the
   AX3000 to be priced well under $50 given that the "Cyclone Peak" card
   at the heart of it costs just $10-17 in volume pricing.

MSI Prepares Another Version of AMD Radeon RX 580 Armor Graphics Card

   Friday, 20:26 Discuss (30 Comments)
   While AMD is giving all signs of being preparing to release their
   latest entries into the midrange graphics card market in the form of
   the RX 5500 and RX 5300 series of graphics cards based on Navi, AMD's
   AIB partners are giving the slow burn on existing inventories of AMD's
   Polaris graphics chips. MSI, in this case, seems to have bet on a
   slight redesign of their previously-released RX 580 Armor and Armor
   MK2.
   Changed is the color scheme - MSI went full black on this one. There's
   also a redesigned PCB, a redesigned I/O bracket (which keeps four
   display connectors), and a new cooler shroud. The heatsink's surface
   area also seems to have been increased, which should provide lower
   operating temperatures (anything beyond that, such as higher
   overclockability and longer lifespan, are speculations). The redesigned
   Armor keeps the single 8-pin PCIe power connector. No other details are
   available at time of writing.

Curiously Named "Athlon Gold" Surfaces on Geekbench Database

   by


    btarunr

   Friday, 18:24 Discuss (13 Comments)
   A Geekbench database submission from an HP "17-ca2xxx" laptop (likely a
   prototype), spilled the beans on an upcoming AMD Athlon Gold 3150U
   processor, with nomenclature that looks inspired from the Pentium Gold.
   Intel uses the "Gold" and "Silver" brand extensions to distinguish
   processors based on its performance microarchitectures from those based
   on its low-power microarchitectures (eg: a "Skylake" based Pentium
   Gold, and a "Goldmont" based Pentium Silver). The addition of "Gold" to
   the Athlon brand could denote performance rivaling mobile versions of
   Pentium Gold found in entry-level full-size notebooks.
   Moving on to the test itself, and we see the Athlon Gold 3150U being
   listed as a "Raven Ridge" derivative featuring a 2-core/4-thread CPU
   and Radeon graphics (likely "Vega 3" as with its desktop counterpart).
   The CPU is shown having a 2.40 GHz base frequency, and 3.30 GHz boost,
   512 KB L2 cache per core, and 4 MB shared L3 cache. The chip scores
   3,559 single-core points, and 7,336 points multi-core, comparable to
   entry-level dual-core processors from this generation. This makes us
   wonder what the Athlon "Silver" could be, and whether AMD is working on
   a new low-power microarchitecture in the near future.

   performance and overwhelming aesthetics smooth working state.
   Even though graphics cards can generate strong performance during
   gaming, the thermal cooling system of graphics cards is an essential
   factor for many gamers to take into account. From alpha to omega, the
   tenet of the GIGABYTE WINDFORCE cooling system is to not only keep GPU
   temperatures lower but just as importantly, to tend to the temperatures
   of the VRAM and MOSFETs, so that the graphics cards offer more
   efficient and stable performance. Distinct from other brands' thermal
   solutions, GIGABYTE allows users to have low-temperature GPU
   performance and reduces the temperature of components such as the VRAM
   and MOSFETs to increase the lifespan. You never encounter the risk of
   damage to components from overheating when your GPU still works well
   under that scenario. GIGABYTE graphics cards are a good choice for
   gamers and delivers reliable, powerful performance.

Intel Recalls Boxed Xeon E-2274G Processors Due to Inadequate Stock Cooler
Effectiveness

   by


    btarunr

   Friday, 09:01 Discuss (44 Comments)
   Intel issued a product change notification (PCN) dated November 13,
   calling for a recall of boxed Xeon E-2274G processors from customers
   and distributors. The boxed SKU of the E-2274G, which includes a stock
   cooling solution, has been marked as "discontinued" and "end of life."
   Intel is offering an E-2274G tray processor (chip-only) as replacement
   for the returned inventory. The cause for the recall is the cooling
   solution included in the boxed SKU, which has been found to be
   insufficient to cool the E-2274G, a 4-core/8-thread processor based on
   the 14 nm++ "Coffee Lake" microarchitecture, with a rated TDP of 88 W.
   The E973708-003 fan-heatsink included with boxed Xeon E-2274G
   processors is supplied by Foxconn, and has been known to be bundled
   with Intel's entry-level client-segment processors, such as the Pentium
   Gold series and Core i3 series (chips with TDP typically rated 65 W or
   less). It features a thin, circular, all-aluminium heatsink, which
   lacks a copper core that certain other LGA115x-compatible stock coolers
   by Intel have. The heatsink makes contact with the CPU over pre-applied
   TIM on an aluminium surface, with spirally-projecting fins dissipating
   heat under the fan's airflow. It could be been an oversight bundling
   such an underpowered cooler with an 88 W TDP processor that's designed
   for the rigors of mission-critical use-cases such as workstations and
   small-business servers.

NVIDIA "Ampere" Successor Reportedly Codenamed "Hopper"

   Friday, 07:19 Discuss (26 Comments)
   NVIDIA has reportedly codenamed a future GPU architecture "Hopper," in
   honor of Grace Hopper, an eminent computer scientist who invented one
   of the first linkers, and programmed the Harvard Mark I computer that
   aided the American war efforts in World War II. This came to light as
   Twitter user "@kopite7kimi," who's had a fairly high hit-rate with
   NVIDIA info tweeted not just the codename, but also a key NVIDIA
   product design change. The tweets were later deleted, but not before
   3DCenter.org reported on them. To begin with, "Hopper" is reportedly
   succeeding the upcoming "Ampere" architecture slated for the first half
   of 2020.
   "Hopper" is also rumored to introduce MCM (multi-chip module) GPU
   packages, which are packages with multiple GPU dies. Currently, GPU
   MCMs are packages that have one GPU die surrounded by memory dies or
   stacks. This combination of GPU dies could make up "giant cores," at
   least in the higher end of the performance spectrum. NVIDIA reserves
   MCMs for only its most expensive Tesla family of compute accelerators,
   or Quadro professional graphics cards, and seldom offers client-segment
   GeForce products.
