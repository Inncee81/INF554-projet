Toulouse, capital of Occitania

   Toulouse is an essential stop-off in the heart of the south west of
   France.
   Once the capital of the Visigoths and now the capital of the air and
   space industry, Toulouse invites you to explore its 2000 years of
   history.
   Here a Roman basilica, there a discrete mansion house with an imposing
   doorway, further on a converted industrial building, a façade with
   astonishing terra cotta decor, the murmur of a fountain, a hidden
   courtyard…Let yourself be guided through quarters that blend history
   and modernity.

   A city with a rich heritage.
