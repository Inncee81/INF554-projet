   In addition to all of the things the Joker publicity cycle has assured
   us Todd Phillips’ Batman-adjacent Scorsese riff is not—not an
   incitement to violence, not an endorsement of its main character’s
   actions, not subject to questions from red-carpet interviewers—there’s
   also this: Despite telling the story of an aspiring comedian who
   becomes an unhinged murder-clown, it’s not a canonical origin story.
   Joker has no connection to any ongoing onscreen saga set in Gotham
   City; Joaquin Phoenix’s Arthur Fleck will not go on to become Jack
   Nicholson’s purring hood Jack Napier, the agent of chaos that earned
   Heath Ledger a posthumous Oscar, or the chrome-grilled edge lord who
   stamped “damaged” on his forehead for Suicide Squad. Rather, he’s
   another voice in a giggling gestalt that has beguiled, tickled, and
   terrified audiences and creators ever since Jerry Robinson first laid
   down a sketch of a Joker card with crimson lips and a fearsome smile.
   The Joker, like his crime-fighting other half, isn’t a fixed idea but
   an ever-evolving archetype: the comical disguise Cesar Romero could don
   without shaving, the lanky killer of ’70s Batman comics, the villain
   who got Mark Hamill to give into the dark side.

   As such, there’s not really anything you need to know about the
   character before seeing the first movie to ever put his name in the
   title. (Because let’s be straight here: This is far from the first time
   the Joker has ever headlined a movie.) But ahead of Joker, you might be
   wondering: What’s the deal with this clown, and why do we keep telling
   stories about him? Without delving too deeply into the obvious—in 2019,
   nobody needs to be out here championing the Tim Burton Batman, The Dark
   Knight, The Killing Joke, or The Dark Knight Returns (though, if you
   haven’t seen or read those, you really should)—perhaps the following
   recommendations can offer some insight. And if they don’t, maybe you
   need to ask yourself another question: Why so serious?
     __________________________________________________________________

Batman, “Surf’s Up! Joker’s Under!” (1968)

   Cesar Romero romanced Betty Grable and saved the day as the Cisco Kid
   before painting over his signature mustache in the role he’d be best
   remembered for: Scuffling with Adam West and Burt Ward in 22 episodes
   of the ’60s live-action Batman series (and its big-screen spin-off).
   Each of those appearances were memorable, but from a simply bizarre
   (and beachy) perspective, one stands out: Season three’s “Surf’s Up!
   Joker’s Under!” At the time, the surfing craze had engulfed so much of
   popular culture that even the Joker was trying to win over the kids at
   Gotham Point by catching a wave in a contest against his arch nemesis.
   It’s largely an excuse for the Batman cast (including Batgirl!) to trot
   out slang like “island pullout” and “cowabunga,” but Joker (and Batman,
   for that matter) have never looked more ridiculous than wearing their
   “baggies” in front of an obvious rear-projection setup. Naturally,
   Batman is the eventual winner, due to the timely use of his Bat-Shark
   Repellant, and the indefatigable Joker is defeated yet again. Romero’s
   campy portrayal may have been the most benign of all Jokers, but he was
   also a hell of a lot of fun. [Gwen Ihnat]

A Death In The Family (1988)

   (BUTTON) (BUTTON) (BUTTON)

   Jim Starlin and Jim Aparo’s A Death In The Family is famous as the
   story where the Joker captures and brutally tortures Jason Todd, the
   second Robin, before leaving him to die in an explosion. That’s the
   part everyone knows, but the Joker’s scheme goes completely off the
   wall in the final act. See, Jason got captured while he and Batman were
   investigating the Joker’s attempt to sell a nuclear weapon to Iran
   (this was the ’80s, after all), and Ayatollah Khomeini is so pleased
   with what the Joker is offering that he names the Clown Prince of Crime
   as his country’s representative to the United Nations and sends him to
   make a speech at the General Assembly in New York City—with the U.S.
   government actually using Superman to stop Batman from doing anything
   in hopes of avoiding an international incident. The speech turns out to
   be a sham and the Joker tries to kill everyone, obviously, giving
   Batman and Superman a chance to beat him up. Later, in a fit of grief
   over Jason’s death, Batman even allows the Joker to nearly get killed
   in a helicopter crash (though he somehow escapes unharmed). [Sam
   Barsanti]

Batman: The Animated Series, “The Laughing Fish” (1993)

   This one’s a threefer, the plots of two legendary comics—“The Joker’s
   Five-Way Revenge” and “The Laughing Fish,” each from a separate,
   legendary run in Batman’s flagship titles—synthesized by the TV series
   that dared to challenge Jack Nicholson for the title of definitive
   onscreen Joker a scant three years after his dance with the devil in
   the pale moon light. It could be a hybrid that looks as unnatural or
   unsightly as the episode’s smiling catch of the day, a televised
   cartoon recreating source material where the Joker bumps off innocent
   copyright clerks and attempts to feed an old man to a shark. This
   “Laughing Fish” hangs together thanks to the fact that those
   comics—widely credited with restoring the Joker’s sense of murderous
   menace (and in the case of Neal Adams and Denny O’Neil’s “Five-Way
   Revenge,” restoring the character’s presence on the comics page,
   period)—begin and end with some toothy sea creatures; it also helps
   that two of the driving forces behind Batman: The Animated, Bruce Timm
   and Paul Dini, are there to guide the episode along the razor’s edge.
   But the most important name in the credits is Mark Hamill, whose crazed
   carnival barker approach to the Joker projects a threat (his cackling
   entrance is just aces) even as the character dons an angler’s cap,
   signals to henchman with a whoopee cushion, and interrupts regularly
   scheduled programming to plug the seafood he’s rendered in his image
   for seemingly arbitrary reasons. Leave it to the Joker to render
   trademark registration into rip-roaring superhero action. [Erik Adams]

Batman Beyond: Return Of The Joker (2000)

   The slick cyberpunk series Batman Beyond acts as a continuation of
   Batman: The Animated Series and The New Batman Adventures, introducing
   viewers to a new Batman—the 16-year-old Terry McGinnis—and a new
   setting—Neo-Gotham in 2039. Beyond also abandoned most of Batman’s
   classic rogues gallery, the most notable exception being the
   direct-to-video feature, Return Of The Joker, released during the
   show’s third and final season. Return Of The Joker marked the first and
   only appearance of the original Clown Prince of Crime in the Beyond
   universe—until that point in the series, he was only referenced through
   the amateurish, Juggalo-looking street gang The Jokerz, who terrorized
   Neo-Gotham in his name. The film opens with the mysterious reappearance
   of The Joker (voiced by a returning Mark Hamill), who was presumed dead
   after an encounter with the original Batman. Without giving too much
   away, what follows is an intriguing expansion of the mythos surrounding
   Hamill’s Joker that occasionally drifts into unsettling territory—one
   scene in particular, a flashback involving the Joker and Batman’s
   former protégé Tim Drake, is genuinely disturbing. In fact, there was
   so much concern over Return Of The Joker’s imagery in the wake of the
   Columbine massacre, Warner Bros. Animation re-edited the film prior to
   its release. The “uncut” version was released on DVD shortly
   thereafter, and is now widely available. [Baraka Kaseko]

Batman #663, “The Clown At Midnight” (2010)

   Advertisement
   (BUTTON) (BUTTON) (BUTTON)

   Few comic authors of the modern era have spent more time or energy on
   the question of what—not who—the Joker really is than Grant Morrison,
   whose character-redefining run on Batman in the late 2000s always
   seemed to circle back somehow to the Thin White Duke of Death. That
   tendency expresses itself most clearly in the prose-only “The Clown At
   Midnight,” in which the Joker methodically, and brutally, kills off all
   of his former henchman in an effort to wipe the slate clean and ready
   himself to become the next, even more monstrous version of his numerous
   personas. Morrison’s Batman run frequently falls back on the idea that
   every weird, nonsensical, magical, or science-fiction adventure that
   Batman engaged in back in the Silver Age really happened, in some form
   or another. “The Clown At Midnight” similarly argues that every Joker
   is the essential Joker, from the boner-spouting goofball of the “Satire
   Years,” to the cold-blooded killer of the New Homicidal, or the
   gleefully smiling clown of the Camp. (Those are all Mistah J’s terms,
   not ours.) In Morrison’s conception, the Joker is simply the ultimate
   survivor, “shuffling selves like a croupier deals cards, to buffer the
   shocks and work some alchemy that might just turn the lead of tragedy
   and horror into into the fierce, chaotic gold of the laughter of the
   damned.” Or, as Morrison also can’t help but note: Maybe he’s just
   nuts. [William Hughes]

Batman: Under The Red Hood (2010)

   Jason Todd’s blood may have been on the Joker’s hands, but it was
   really the majority of Batman readers who (narrowly) killed the second
   Boy Wonder in 1988. But just like in soap operas, popular comics
   characters rarely stay dead forever, and Jason eventually returned,
   first in the “Under The Hood” storyline that ran from 2004 to 2006, and
   then an excellent direct-to-video movie in 2010. The movie reveals that
   after Joker beat Robin with a crowbar and blew him up in a warehouse,
   Ra’s al Ghul swiped Jason’s body and revived him in the Lazarus Pit.
   Jason grows up to be a crime boss known as the Red Hood (an alias that
   factors into the Joker’s classic origin story), but his biggest beef
   with Batman is the same as many of ours: Why is Joker still alive?
   Jensen Ackles impressively captures Jason’s combined rage and grief as
   he protests: “If it had been you that he beat to a bloody pulp, if he
   had taken you from this world, I would’ve done nothing but search the
   planet for this pathetic pile of evil, death-worshiping garbage and
   then send him off to hell!” Although Joker basically functions as a
   pawn here in the battle between Jason and his former mentor, Under The
   Red Hood uncovers the truth of Batman’s eternal moral quandary. Voiced
   by Bruce Greenwood, Batman painfully admits as much to Jason: He thinks
   about killing Joker every day, but once he started killing, he’d never
   stop, and his battle over the darkness in his own soul would be lost:
   “If I allow myself to go down into that place… I’ll never come back.”
   So Joker survives, continuing to torment Batman as long as the Caped
   Crusader exists. [Gwen Ihnat]

Endgame (2012)

   Illustration for article titled A deck of Jokers: Going deeper with The
   Clown Prince Of Crime
   Screenshot: Engame

   A lot of Joker stories are about his perception of the relationship he
   has with Batman, like The Dark Knight’s “you complete me” speech, but
   Scott Snyder and Greg Capullo’s Endgame story arc is an inversion of
   that. After years of trying to convince Batman that they’re essentially
   soulmates, the Joker is done. He just wants Batman to die. To do that,
   he releases a gas in Gotham that forces everyone (including the Justice
   League) to try and kill their loved ones. As he searches for a cure,
   Batman realizes that an Arkham orderly named Eric Border (who had been
   in Batman comics for a year or so) was actually the Joker in disguise,
   and he finds seemingly definitive proof that Joker is actually
   immortal. It’s more complicated than that, but the story ends with both
   Joker and Batman seemingly dying when an underground cave collapses on
   them. Make sure to stick around for the next story arc, where an
   amnesiac Bruce Wayne meets a somewhat “cured” Joker who is trying to
   live an honest life and pleads with him to never put on the cape and
   cowl again—because he’s afraid of what he’ll become if Batman returns.

Batman: Arkham Knight (2015)

   Advertisement
   (BUTTON) (BUTTON) (BUTTON)

   Mark Hamill’s definitive vocal take on the Joker rarely got a better
   chance to shine than in Rocksteady’s trilogy of Batman-based Arkham
   games, where—dead, or alive—the Joker always seemed to somehow get the
   last laugh. Nowhere was that clearer than in 2015’s big finale to the
   series, Arkham Knight, where Hamill’s drolly cackling supercriminal
   refuses to let a silly little thing like dying at the end of the
   previous game get in the way of spreading some of his signature mirth.
   The game’s most brilliant twist—empowered by a dose of fear toxin from
   its ostensible “main” villain, Scarecrow—places Hamill’s Joker as the
   intangible, constantly snarking devil on Bruce Wayne’s shoulder,
   driving him deeper and deeper into green-eyed madness as the night
   wears on. Hamill has always been the funniest of the Jokers, but he
   really gets a chance to shine here, laying down one-liner after
   one-liner that only his increasingly harried “buddy” can hear. At the
   same time, he gleefully leans into the series’ vision of the Joker’s
   most terrifying trait: Not what he’s done to people, or what he will
   do. Rather, it’s the madness he represents, always looming and
   threatening to eat away at the mind of a hero who often seems like he
   might be one bad night away from finally getting the joke. [William
   Hughes]

   [avclub-saturated.png] Age Of HeroesWith Age Of Heroes, Tom Breihan
   picks the most important superhero movie of every year, starting with
   the genre’s early big-budget moments and moving onto the
   multiplex-crushing monsters of today.

   Midway through Christopher Nolan’s 2008 movie The Dark Knight, the
   Joker gets himself arrested so that he can then break out of his
   holding cell and continue his grand experiment in human darkness. While
   he’s locked up, he’s placed in the custody of the Major Crimes Unit,
   the police force that’s supposedly been devoted to locking up Batman.
   In the movie, people keep referring to the Major Crimes Unit as the
   MCU. As in: “There’s a problem at the MCU!” Watching it today, you
   might hurt your neck doing double-takes at those initials every time.
   The Dark Knight, as it happens, came out at the last moment that “MCU”
   could possibly refer to anything related to Batman.

   Today, of course, we know the MCU as the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the
   steamrolling blockbuster-generating engine that has become the dominant
   commercial force in all of moviemaking. It was never a given that the
   Marvel Cinematic Universe would work. By the time the people at Marvel
   got around to establishing their own movie studio, they’d already sold
   off the rights to many of their most-famous characters: Spider-Man, the
   X-Men, the Fantastic Four. Only the relative dregs were left over, and
   nobody knew whether a relatively minor character like Iron Man could
   anchor a whole movie, let alone a franchise. It was a gamble.

   It was a gamble, too, to cast Robert Downey Jr., a faded star who’d
   spent years battling his personal demons. It was a gamble to go against
   the sober, contemplative tone of superhero movies like Batman Begins or
   Superman Returns. Marvel instead found a light, quippy aesthetic—one
   that acknowledged the absurdity of the whole enterprise while still
   allowing for genuine adventure-serial thrills. (The Incredible Hulk,
   the second Marvel Cinematic Universe film, which came out a month
   before The Dark Knight, marked an altogether-unsuccessful reversion to
   that serious, heavy style.) The Iron Man gamble paid off spectacularly,
   many times over.

   Iron Man wasn’t just a hit, and it wasn’t just a tremendously
   entertaining movie. It was the foundation upon which an entire movie
   institution was built. More than a decade later, Marvel is still
   running with that tone and that aesthetic, and it is utterly dominating
   everything else in Hollywood. Rewatching Iron Man today, it’s
   remarkable how much of what would later power the whole franchise is
   already there: S.H.I.E.L.D, Agent Coulson, Downey’s nonstop smirky
   patter, Tony Stark’s unfortunate tendency to power up his own enemies,
   the soothing robot voice that Paul Bettany adopted years before he
   found himself painted red and green. (It’s also a more intense movie
   than you might remember. I tried to show it to my kids, and they were
   done as soon as the missiles hit the convoy.) And with that famous Iron
   Man post-credits scene, Marvel set up a dizzying array of future-movie
   possibilities. And then it somehow made good on those possibilities.
   That’s amazing.

   Iron Man’s importance, both to superhero movies and to cinema in
   general, cannot be overstated. And yet Iron Man was not the most
   important superhero movie of 2008. That distinction belongs to The Dark
   Knight, which was a genuine cultural phenomenon and which changed the
   way the public at large saw superheroes in the same way that Jaws
   changed sharks or Star Wars changed spaceships. Before The Dark Knight,
   superhero movies made money, but they were a sideshow. The Dark Knight
   made money, too; it was the highest-grossing movie of 2008. But it
   didn’t just make money. It was, in its moment, widely hailed as
   something resembling a masterpiece. When, for instance, the Academy Of
   Motion Picture Arts And Sciences failed to nominate The Dark Knight for
   a Best Picture Oscar, there was such a wide public outcry that the
   Academy changed its roles to allow for more nominees. That is an
   impact.

   Now: The Dark Knight is a better movie than the perfectly okay Slumdog
   Millionaire, the movie that ended up winning Best Picture for that
   year. But it’s no masterpiece. The Dark Knight is jagged and
   propulsive, sometimes to a fault. Scenes rarely get a chance to linger,
   to establish dramatic presence. When, for instance, Bruce Wayne is
   getting ready to quit being Batman and let Harvey Dent take over as
   Gotham City’s protector, there is no emotional weight there; it’s just
   a storyline move. The movie includes the best action set piece in any
   Batman movie, the astonishing truck chase, but the regular fight scenes
   (like the ones in Batman Begins) are too choppy to be properly
   thrilling. There’s the long Hong Kong interlude, which is pretty and
   fun but also extraneous and dumb—a clear excuse to get some Batman
   ass-kicking into a stretch of the movie that was otherwise notably
   devoid of Batman ass-kicking.

   And then there’s the last 40 minutes of the movie, where everything
   gets baggy and indistinct and sometimes dumb. The Joker gets an
   anticlimactic sendoff, dangling upside-down and trading barbs with
   Batman before Batman rushes off to find that Harvey Dent has become
   Two-Face. A surprisingly moving Tiny Lister moment saves a sequence
   that’s otherwise a dramatized version of a freshman philosophy-class
   thought experiment. And then there’s the whole thing about Batman
   bugging everyone’s cellphones, using a magical TV-bank doohickey to
   listen the Joker’s voice-waves (or whatever) while dumb-looking
   static-light things go over his eyes. For way too long, the movie turns
   into an episode of 24. When The Dark Knight came out, I can vividly
   remember seeing Glenn Beck on CNN, enthusiastically crowing about how
   the film was endorsing George W. Bush’s Patriot Act tactics. You never
   want Glenn Beck to think that you’re on his side.

   For all that, though, The Dark Knight still represents a towering
   achievement, from the nasty economy of the opening robbery scene to the
   final goosebump moment where Gary Oldman intones the movie’s title.
   Christopher Nolan made a fantastically engrossing summer entertainment
   full of big gestures that still sustained a fevered, immersive mood.
   The whole idea of The Dark Knight is that insanity begets more
   insanity. Batman has gone to extreme lengths to keep his city safe, and
   then he’s forced to contend with the possibility that he’s only made
   things worse, inspiring a wave of bad guys that’s just as into symbolic
   gestures as he is. Throughout the movie, we see images of that insanity
   encroaching: piles of money burning, corpses dangling, a civic hero
   transformed into a hate-driven freak. It’s there in the filmmaking,
   too—in the drones and whines of the incredible score, in the way the
   disorienting cameras whirl around simple conversations. And of course,
   it’s there in Heath Ledger.

   Ledger’s whole performance was a focus of widespread fascination before
   the movie had even come out. Before The Dark Knight, most of us figured
   that Jack Nicholson had already been the definitive Joker in Tim
   Burton’s 1989 Batman. (In an interview before The Dark Knight’s
   release, Nicholson said that he was “furious” that nobody had called
   him to be in this new Batman movie.) But then Ledger died of an
   accidental overdose months before the movie came out. This was one of
   the most truly shocking celebrity deaths of this century. It was River
   Phoenix all over again: a charismatic and talented young star who’d
   already proven himself as a talent and who didn’t really give off the
   image of someone who had problems like that.

   Ledger’s death was sad, even for those of us who’d never met him. But
   I’ll speak only for myself here: In some dark and shitty corner of my
   mind, his death also made me more excited for the movie. Maybe, I
   thought, Ledger had pushed himself so far into darkness while making
   this movie that he didn’t fully know how to pull himself out. Maybe he
   had essentially killed himself in bringing this character to life. And
   maybe that deadly devotion would manifest itself onscreen.

   Ledger’s death lent the movie a weird romanticism, sort of like the one
   that Kurt Cobain’s suicide gave to Nirvana’s MTV Unplugged In New York.
   Suddenly, we knew we were watching a major artist giving his last major
   work. This is the wrong way to think. There’s nothing romantic about
   death by addiction. It’s messy and shitty and sad, and it doesn’t fit
   into the pat narratives that we come up with.

   And yet Ledger’s performance as the Joker really was magical—powerful
   enough that Nicholson’s Joker almost instantly became a faded footnote.
   As the Joker, Ledger is legitimately disgusting: dirty and scarred-up,
   with yellow teeth and a tongue that’s constantly darting in and out of
   his mouth, like a lizard’s. But he’s magnetic, too. He tells different
   stories about his scars, just so we’ll know that he’s always lying. He
   confounds criminals as badly as he does police. He dances his way
   through a hospital explosion and intimidates a roomful of mob bosses.
   His voice—the best description I can manage is a tweaked-out Richard
   Nixon impression—is chilling and alien. And he seems to be in love with
   Batman in ways that make even Batman uncomfortable: “Don’t talk like
   you’re one of them. You’re not.”

   The criminal-mastermind stuff in The Dark Knight is fun. Even when you
   know it’s coming, the Joker’s escape from the police station is
   gripping; he’s putting such work into his schemes. And nobody’s ever
   handled a bazooka as nonchalantly as Ledger does during that chase
   scene. But the real great thing about The Dark Knight is the way the
   Joker has no real purpose—how his purpose is purposelessness. He calls
   himself “an agent of chaos,” which is both on-the-nose and accurate. We
   never get a real origin story for this Joker. He doesn’t even have a
   name. He’s just a force, a walking human entropy, “nothing in his
   pockets but knives and lint.”

   He’s a hell of a storytelling device, too. Nolan’s real point with the
   movie, I think, is to illustrate how close so many of are to madness,
   how civilization is always hanging by a fragile thread. That’s why the
   movie’s central tragedy is in the way Harvey Dent falls apart, and
   that’s why Batman ends the movie by willingly transforming himself into
   a scapegoat. It’s a compelling arc, and yet Ledger’s Joker cuts such a
   powerful figure that it overwhelms the movie, turning both Dent and
   Batman into marginal figures. The most memorable image in the movie
   isn’t Dent’s Two-Face reveal or Batman disappearing back into shadow at
   the end. It’s the Joker, high on his own malevolence, hanging his head
   out of a cop-car window like he’s a dog.

   Maybe Nolan intended for this to happen, and maybe he didn’t. Either
   way, he put together a cultural sensation that still has its hooks in
   us. Think of the way so many stray phrases from that beautifully
   written script have seeped into the lexicon: “You either die a hero, or
   you live long enough to see yourself become the villain,” “some men
   just want to watch the world burn,” “destined to do this forever.” The
   Dark Knight has entered the collective unconscious. It’ll always be
   with us.

   And for that reason, I’d argue that The Dark Knight is the most
   important superhero movie in history, not just of 2008. The Dark Knight
   is the reason that the public at large is willing to take superhero
   movies so seriously. It’s the buzz that we’re still chasing. It’s the
   promise fulfilled. It’s a vast summer blockbuster made without even the
   slightest consideration given to entertaining children, which of course
   means that children love it. The Dark Knight is an influential movie,
   of course, with goobers like Zack Snyder and David Ayer attempting to
   use its all-pervading bad vibes in way more ham-fisted ways. But its
   importance goes far beyond that direct influence.

   Iron Man was a miracle, of course, but I’d argue that after that, the
   Marvel Cinematic Universe didn’t produce another actual good movie for
   another three years. And I think The Dark Knight, just as much as Iron
   Man, is the reason that the Marvel Cinematic Universe is still around
   and still dominating. The Dark Knight showed Hollywood studios, and the
   public at large, what a superhero movie could be. After that, everyone
   had to try a whole lot harder.

   Other notable 2008 superhero movies: We’ve already addressed Iron Man
   in some depth. There’s an argument to be made that Iron Man is the
   second-most important superhero movie ever made. Hell, there’s probably
   an argument that it’s the most important superhero movie.

   But we should also talk about The Incredible Hulk, Marvel’s other
   inaugural MCU offering. Maybe it was brave of Marvel to attempt a
   reboot of their big green rage-monster only five years after the Ang
   Lee version. And the movie has some fun scenes, like a battle between
   the Hulk and some Army troops on a college campus. But French
   action-movie auteur Louis Leterrier gave the movie a drab, flat look,
   and star Edward Norton rewrote the script, making it heavier than it
   had to be. Marvel learned its lesson, adapting a bright and shiny
   in-house look and jettisoning both Norton and Iron Man’s Terrence
   Howard for actors who would play ball. In making these moves, Marvel
   effectively killed the primacy of both stars and directors, recognizing
   the characters and the storylines as the real draws. So now The
   Incredible Hulk is a historic scrapheap curiosity.

   Another road-not-taken Marvel movie is Lexi Alexander’s almost
   hilariously violent Punisher: War Zone, the third and probably final
   attempt to turn Marvel’s brutal vigilante antihero into a movie’s
   leading man. In this one, Ray Stevenson plays Frank Castle as a
   gigantic stab-happy Jason Voorhees motherfucker, a stone-carved killing
   machine, while Alexander piles on the exaggerated slapstick gore and
   various character actors, led by Dominic West, do their best to make
   Castle’s victims into unsympathetic caricatures. Marvel is probably
   right that the Punisher is better in Netflix-miniseries form than as
   the star of a major motion picture, but I really love this movie’s
   hyper-violent absurdism.

   With Hellboy II: The Golden Army, future Oscar winner Guillermo del
   Toro brought back the beloved cult-comics figure he’d already adapted
   and pitted him against a horde of magical Celtic-myth elf-creatures.
   Del Toro’s never been afraid of silliness, and Hellboy II has plenty of
   that. But it’s also a movie full of imaginative monster designs and
   gorgeous fantastical images. I don’t think it’s a classic, the way some
   people do, but it is top-shelf stoner spectacle.

   Hancock is another curiosity: a big-budget summer movie about a newly
   invented superhero, a way-too-powerful unreliable drunk with mysterious
   origins and no idea how to function alongside the rest of society. The
   movie doesn’t altogether work, but it does make some fascinatingly
   strange turns, especially once we learn a few things about a couple of
   characters’ origins.

   With The Spirit, meanwhile, comics legend Frank Miller, directing by
   himself for the first time, tried to make a CGI-heavy noir adaptation
   out of Will Eisner’s foundational superhero comic strip. The result is
   a notorious disaster, a self-important work of aestheticized nonsense
   that wastes the talents of way too many movie stars who should’ve known
   better. It’s the sort of movie that forces us to reconsider whether
   Frank Miller really was ever that great or whether he was just skating
   through his career on one hard-boiled cliché after another.

   The Spirit villain Samuel L. Jackson, still in the process of becoming
   Nick Fury, was also a villain in Doug Liman’s Jumper, about a kid who
   discovers that he’s part of a secret teleporting race. The pretty-good
   animated movie Bolt gave us the story of a TV-actor dog who thinks he,
   like his TV character, has actual powers. Franklyn was a British movie
   with Ryan Phillippe as a masked crimefighter who travels between
   realities. The superhero-adjacent Wanted adapted a deeply toxic Mark
   Millar comic about a society of supernaturally gifted assassins.
   Meanwhile, the dumber-than-fuck parody Superhero Movie was a
   probably-premature joke-a-minute parody about the still-developing
   superhero-movie genre. But since the parody-movie genre was on its last
   legs at the time, and since the movie sucked, it didn’t make much
   impact.

   Next time: Zack Snyder adapts Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons’ foundational
   comic-book masterpiece Watchmen into a confounding big-budget movie.

A deck of Jokers: Going deeper with The Clown Prince Of Crime

   In addition to all of the things the Joker publicity cycle has assured
   us Todd Phillips’ Batman-adjacent Scorsese riff is not—not an
   incitement to violence, not an endorsement of its main character’s
   actions, not subject to questions from red-carpet interviewers—there’s
   also this: Despite telling the story of an aspiring comedian who
   becomes an unhinged murder-clown, it’s not a canonical origin story.
   Joker has no connection to any ongoing onscreen saga set in Gotham
   City; Joaquin Phoenix’s Arthur Fleck will not go on to become Jack
   Nicholson’s purring hood Jack Napier, the agent of chaos that earned
   Heath Ledger a posthumous Oscar, or the chrome-grilled edge lord who
   stamped “damaged” on his forehead for Suicide Squad. Rather, he’s
   another voice in a giggling gestalt that has beguiled, tickled, and
   terrified audiences and creators ever since Jerry Robinson first laid
   down a sketch of a Joker card with crimson lips and a fearsome smile.
   The Joker, like his crime-fighting other half, isn’t a fixed idea but
   an ever-evolving archetype: the comical disguise Cesar Romero could don
   without shaving, the lanky killer of ’70s Batman comics, the villain
   who got Mark Hamill to give into the dark side.

So, wait: What’s going on with all these Jokers?

   Last week, Hangover director Todd Phillips began revealing his upcoming
   Joker origin story. It…

   As such, there’s not really anything you need to know about the
   character before seeing the first movie to ever put his name in the
   title. (Because let’s be straight here: This is far from the first time
   the Joker has ever headlined a movie.) But ahead of Joker, you might be
   wondering: What’s the deal with this clown, and why do we keep telling
   stories about him? Without delving too deeply into the obvious—in 2019,
   nobody needs to be out here championing the Tim Burton Batman, The Dark
   Knight, The Killing Joke, or The Dark Knight Returns (though, if you
   haven’t seen or read those, you really should)—perhaps the following
   recommendations can offer some insight. And if they don’t, maybe you
   need to ask yourself another question: Why so serious?

Batman, “Surf’s Up! Joker’s Under!” (1968)

   Cesar Romero romanced Betty Grable and saved the day as the Cisco Kid
   before painting over his signature mustache in the role he’d be best
   remembered for: Scuffling with Adam West and Burt Ward in 22 episodes
   of the ’60s live-action Batman series (and its big-screen spin-off).
   Each of those appearances were memorable, but from a simply bizarre
   (and beachy) perspective, one stands out: Season three’s “Surf’s Up!
   Joker’s Under!” At the time, the surfing craze had engulfed so much of
   popular culture that even the Joker was trying to win over the kids at
   Gotham Point by catching a wave in a contest against his arch nemesis.
   It’s largely an excuse for the Batman cast (including Batgirl!) to trot
   out slang like “island pullout” and “cowabunga,” but Joker (and Batman,
   for that matter) have never looked more ridiculous than wearing their
   “baggies” in front of an obvious rear-projection setup. Naturally,
   Batman is the eventual winner, due to the timely use of his Bat-Shark
   Repellant, and the indefatigable Joker is defeated yet again. Romero’s
   campy portrayal may have been the most benign of all Jokers, but he was
   also a hell of a lot of fun. [Gwen Ihnat]

A Death In The Family (1988)

   Jim Starlin and Jim Aparo’s A Death In The Family is famous as the
   story where the Joker captures and brutally tortures Jason Todd, the
   second Robin, before leaving him to die in an explosion. That’s the
   part everyone knows, but the Joker’s scheme goes completely off the
   wall in the final act. See, Jason got captured while he and Batman were
   investigating the Joker’s attempt to sell a nuclear weapon to Iran
   (this was the ’80s, after all), and Ayatollah Khomeini is so pleased
   with what the Joker is offering that he names the Clown Prince of Crime
   as his country’s representative to the United Nations and sends him to
   make a speech at the General Assembly in New York City—with the U.S.
   government actually using Superman to stop Batman from doing anything
   in hopes of avoiding an international incident. The speech turns out to
   be a sham and the Joker tries to kill everyone, obviously, giving
   Batman and Superman a chance to beat him up. Later, in a fit of grief
   over Jason’s death, Batman even allows the Joker to nearly get killed
   in a helicopter crash (though he somehow escapes unharmed). [Sam

Batman: The Animated Series, “The Laughing Fish” (1993)

   This one’s a threefer, the plots of two legendary comics—“The Joker’s
   Five-Way Revenge” and “The Laughing Fish,” each from a separate,
   legendary run in Batman’s flagship titles—synthesized by the TV series
   that dared to challenge Jack Nicholson for the title of definitive
   onscreen Joker a scant three years after his dance with the devil in
   the pale moon light. It could be a hybrid that looks as unnatural or
   unsightly as the episode’s smiling catch of the day, a televised
   cartoon recreating source material where the Joker bumps off innocent
   copyright clerks and attempts to feed an old man to a shark. This
   “Laughing Fish” hangs together thanks to the fact that those
   comics—widely credited with restoring the Joker’s sense of murderous
   menace (and in the case of Neal Adams and Denny O’Neil’s “Five-Way
   Revenge,” restoring the character’s presence on the comics page,
   period)—begin and end with some toothy sea creatures; it also helps
   that two of the driving forces behind Batman: The Animated, Bruce Timm
   and Paul Dini, are there to guide the episode along the razor’s edge.
   But the most important name in the credits is Mark Hamill, whose crazed
   carnival barker approach to the Joker projects a threat (his cackling
   entrance is just aces) even as the character dons an angler’s cap,
   signals to henchman with a whoopee cushion, and interrupts regularly
   scheduled programming to plug the seafood he’s rendered in his image
   for seemingly arbitrary reasons. Leave it to the Joker to render
   trademark registration into rip-roaring superhero action. [Erik Adams]

Batman Beyond: Return Of The Joker (2000)

   The slick cyberpunk series Batman Beyond acts as a continuation of
   Batman: The Animated Series and The New Batman Adventures, introducing
   viewers to a new Batman—the 16-year-old Terry McGinnis—and a new
   setting—Neo-Gotham in 2039. Beyond also abandoned most of Batman’s
   classic rogues gallery, the most notable exception being the
   direct-to-video feature, Return Of The Joker, released during the
   show’s third and final season. Return Of The Joker marked the first and
   only appearance of the original Clown Prince of Crime in the Beyond
   universe—until that point in the series, he was only referenced through
   the amateurish, Juggalo-looking street gang The Jokerz, who terrorized
   Neo-Gotham in his name. The film opens with the mysterious reappearance
   of The Joker (voiced by a returning Mark Hamill), who was presumed dead
   after an encounter with the original Batman. Without giving too much
   away, what follows is an intriguing expansion of the mythos surrounding
   Hamill’s Joker that occasionally drifts into unsettling territory—one
   scene in particular, a flashback involving the Joker and Batman’s
   former protégé Tim Drake, is genuinely disturbing. In fact, there was
   so much concern over Return Of The Joker’s imagery in the wake of the
   Columbine massacre, Warner Bros. Animation re-edited the film prior to
   its release. The “uncut” version was released on DVD shortly
   thereafter, and is now widely available. [Baraka Kaseko]

Batman #663, “The Clown At Midnight” (2010)

   Few comic authors of the modern era have spent more time or energy on
   the question of what—not who—the Joker really is than Grant Morrison,
   whose character-redefining run on Batman in the late 2000s always
   seemed to circle back somehow to the Thin White Duke of Death. That
   tendency expresses itself most clearly in the prose-only “The Clown At
   Midnight,” in which the Joker methodically, and brutally, kills off all
   of his former henchman in an effort to wipe the slate clean and ready
   himself to become the next, even more monstrous version of his numerous
   personas. Morrison’s Batman run frequently falls back on the idea that
   every weird, nonsensical, magical, or science-fiction adventure that
   Batman engaged in back in the Silver Age really happened, in some form
   or another. “The Clown At Midnight” similarly argues that every Joker
   is the essential Joker, from the boner-spouting goofball of the “Satire
   Years,” to the cold-blooded killer of the New Homicidal, or the
   gleefully smiling clown of the Camp. (Those are all Mistah J’s terms,
   not ours.) In Morrison’s conception, the Joker is simply the ultimate
   survivor, “shuffling selves like a croupier deals cards, to buffer the
   shocks and work some alchemy that might just turn the lead of tragedy
   and horror into into the fierce, chaotic gold of the laughter of the
   damned.” Or, as Morrison also can’t help but note: Maybe he’s just
   nuts. [William Hughes]

Batman: Under The Red Hood (2010)

   Jason Todd’s blood may have been on the Joker’s hands, but it was
   really the majority of Batman readers who (narrowly) killed the second
   Boy Wonder in 1988. But just like in soap operas, popular comics
   characters rarely stay dead forever, and Jason eventually returned,
   first in the “Under The Hood” storyline that ran from 2004 to 2006, and
   then an excellent direct-to-video movie in 2010. The movie reveals that
   after Joker beat Robin with a crowbar and blew him up in a warehouse,
   Ra’s al Ghul swiped Jason’s body and revived him in the Lazarus Pit.
   Jason grows up to be a crime boss known as the Red Hood (an alias that
   factors into the Joker’s classic origin story), but his biggest beef
   with Batman is the same as many of ours: Why is Joker still alive?
   Jensen Ackles impressively captures Jason’s combined rage and grief as
   he protests: “If it had been you that he beat to a bloody pulp, if he
   had taken you from this world, I would’ve done nothing but search the
   planet for this pathetic pile of evil, death-worshiping garbage and
   then send him off to hell!” Although Joker basically functions as a
   pawn here in the battle between Jason and his former mentor, Under The
   Red Hood uncovers the truth of Batman’s eternal moral quandary. Voiced
   by Bruce Greenwood, Batman painfully admits as much to Jason: He thinks
   about killing Joker every day, but once he started killing, he’d never
   stop, and his battle over the darkness in his own soul would be lost:
   “If I allow myself to go down into that place… I’ll never come back.”
   So Joker survives, continuing to torment Batman as long as the Caped
   Crusader exists. [Gwen Ihnat]

Endgame (2012)

   Illustration for article titled A deck of Jokers: Going deeper with The
   Clown Prince Of Crime
   Screenshot: Engame

   A lot of Joker stories are about his perception of the relationship he
   has with Batman, like The Dark Knight’s “you complete me” speech, but
   Scott Snyder and Greg Capullo’s Endgame story arc is an inversion of
   that. After years of trying to convince Batman that they’re essentially
   soulmates, the Joker is done. He just wants Batman to die. To do that,
   he releases a gas in Gotham that forces everyone (including the Justice
   League) to try and kill their loved ones. As he searches for a cure,
   Batman realizes that an Arkham orderly named Eric Border (who had been
   in Batman comics for a year or so) was actually the Joker in disguise,
   and he finds seemingly definitive proof that Joker is actually
   immortal. It’s more complicated than that, but the story ends with both
   Joker and Batman seemingly dying when an underground cave collapses on
   them. Make sure to stick around for the next story arc, where an
   amnesiac Bruce Wayne meets a somewhat “cured” Joker who is trying to
   live an honest life and pleads with him to never put on the cape and
   cowl again—because he’s afraid of what he’ll become if Batman returns.

Batman: Arkham Knight (2015)

   (BUTTON) (BUTTON) (BUTTON)

   Mark Hamill’s definitive vocal take on the Joker rarely got a better
   chance to shine than in Rocksteady’s trilogy of Batman-based Arkham
   games, where—dead, or alive—the Joker always seemed to somehow get the
   last laugh. Nowhere was that clearer than in 2015’s big finale to the
   series, Arkham Knight, where Hamill’s drolly cackling supercriminal
   refuses to let a silly little thing like dying at the end of the
   previous game get in the way of spreading some of his signature mirth.
   The game’s most brilliant twist—empowered by a dose of fear toxin from
   its ostensible “main” villain, Scarecrow—places Hamill’s Joker as the
   intangible, constantly snarking devil on Bruce Wayne’s shoulder,
   driving him deeper and deeper into green-eyed madness as the night
   wears on. Hamill has always been the funniest of the Jokers, but he
   really gets a chance to shine here, laying down one-liner after
   one-liner that only his increasingly harried “buddy” can hear. At the
   same time, he gleefully leans into the series’ vision of the Joker’s
   most terrifying trait: Not what he’s done to people, or what he will
   do. Rather, it’s the madness he represents, always looming and
   threatening to eat away at the mind of a hero who often seems like he
   might be one bad night away from finally getting the joke. [William
   Hughes]

   [avclub-saturated.png] Age Of HeroesWith Age Of Heroes, Tom Breihan
   picks the most important superhero movie of every year, starting with
   the genre’s early big-budget moments and moving onto the
   multiplex-crushing monsters of today.

   Midway through Christopher Nolan’s 2008 movie The Dark Knight, the
   Joker gets himself arrested so that he can then break out of his
   holding cell and continue his grand experiment in human darkness. While
   he’s locked up, he’s placed in the custody of the Major Crimes Unit,
   the police force that’s supposedly been devoted to locking up Batman.
   In the movie, people keep referring to the Major Crimes Unit as the
   MCU. As in: “There’s a problem at the MCU!” Watching it today, you
   might hurt your neck doing double-takes at those initials every time.
   The Dark Knight, as it happens, came out at the last moment that “MCU”
   could possibly refer to anything related to Batman.

   Today, of course, we know the MCU as the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the
   steamrolling blockbuster-generating engine that has become the dominant
   commercial force in all of moviemaking. It was never a given that the
   Marvel Cinematic Universe would work. By the time the people at Marvel
   got around to establishing their own movie studio, they’d already sold
   off the rights to many of their most-famous characters: Spider-Man, the
   X-Men, the Fantastic Four. Only the relative dregs were left over, and
   nobody knew whether a relatively minor character like Iron Man could
   anchor a whole movie, let alone a franchise. It was a gamble.

   It was a gamble, too, to cast Robert Downey Jr., a faded star who’d
   spent years battling his personal demons. It was a gamble to go against
   the sober, contemplative tone of superhero movies like Batman Begins or
   Superman Returns. Marvel instead found a light, quippy aesthetic—one
   that acknowledged the absurdity of the whole enterprise while still
   allowing for genuine adventure-serial thrills. (The Incredible Hulk,
   the second Marvel Cinematic Universe film, which came out a month
   before The Dark Knight, marked an altogether-unsuccessful reversion to
   that serious, heavy style.) The Iron Man gamble paid off spectacularly,
   many times over.

   Iron Man wasn’t just a hit, and it wasn’t just a tremendously
   entertaining movie. It was the foundation upon which an entire movie
   institution was built. More than a decade later, Marvel is still
   running with that tone and that aesthetic, and it is utterly dominating
   everything else in Hollywood. Rewatching Iron Man today, it’s
   remarkable how much of what would later power the whole franchise is
   already there: S.H.I.E.L.D, Agent Coulson, Downey’s nonstop smirky
   patter, Tony Stark’s unfortunate tendency to power up his own enemies,
   the soothing robot voice that Paul Bettany adopted years before he
   found himself painted red and green. (It’s also a more intense movie
   than you might remember. I tried to show it to my kids, and they were
   done as soon as the missiles hit the convoy.) And with that famous Iron
   Man post-credits scene, Marvel set up a dizzying array of future-movie
   possibilities. And then it somehow made good on those possibilities.
   That’s amazing.

   Iron Man’s importance, both to superhero movies and to cinema in
   general, cannot be overstated. And yet Iron Man was not the most
   important superhero movie of 2008. That distinction belongs to The Dark
   Knight, which was a genuine cultural phenomenon and which changed the
   way the public at large saw superheroes in the same way that Jaws
   changed sharks or Star Wars changed spaceships. Before The Dark Knight,
   superhero movies made money, but they were a sideshow. The Dark Knight
   made money, too; it was the highest-grossing movie of 2008. But it
   didn’t just make money. It was, in its moment, widely hailed as
   something resembling a masterpiece. When, for instance, the Academy Of
   Motion Picture Arts And Sciences failed to nominate The Dark Knight for
   a Best Picture Oscar, there was such a wide public outcry that the
   Academy changed its roles to allow for more nominees. That is an
   impact.

   Now: The Dark Knight is a better movie than the perfectly okay Slumdog
   Millionaire, the movie that ended up winning Best Picture for that
   year. But it’s no masterpiece. The Dark Knight is jagged and
   propulsive, sometimes to a fault. Scenes rarely get a chance to linger,
   to establish dramatic presence. When, for instance, Bruce Wayne is
   getting ready to quit being Batman and let Harvey Dent take over as
   Gotham City’s protector, there is no emotional weight there; it’s just
   a storyline move. The movie includes the best action set piece in any
   Batman movie, the astonishing truck chase, but the regular fight scenes
   (like the ones in Batman Begins) are too choppy to be properly
   thrilling. There’s the long Hong Kong interlude, which is pretty and
   fun but also extraneous and dumb—a clear excuse to get some Batman
   ass-kicking into a stretch of the movie that was otherwise notably
   devoid of Batman ass-kicking.

   And then there’s the last 40 minutes of the movie, where everything
   gets baggy and indistinct and sometimes dumb. The Joker gets an
   anticlimactic sendoff, dangling upside-down and trading barbs with
   Batman before Batman rushes off to find that Harvey Dent has become
   Two-Face. A surprisingly moving Tiny Lister moment saves a sequence
   that’s otherwise a dramatized version of a freshman philosophy-class
   thought experiment. And then there’s the whole thing about Batman
   bugging everyone’s cellphones, using a magical TV-bank doohickey to
   listen the Joker’s voice-waves (or whatever) while dumb-looking
   static-light things go over his eyes. For way too long, the movie turns
   into an episode of 24. When The Dark Knight came out, I can vividly
   remember seeing Glenn Beck on CNN, enthusiastically crowing about how
   the film was endorsing George W. Bush’s Patriot Act tactics. You never
   want Glenn Beck to think that you’re on his side.

   For all that, though, The Dark Knight still represents a towering
   achievement, from the nasty economy of the opening robbery scene to the
   final goosebump moment where Gary Oldman intones the movie’s title.
   Christopher Nolan made a fantastically engrossing summer entertainment
   full of big gestures that still sustained a fevered, immersive mood.
   The whole idea of The Dark Knight is that insanity begets more
   insanity. Batman has gone to extreme lengths to keep his city safe, and
   then he’s forced to contend with the possibility that he’s only made
   things worse, inspiring a wave of bad guys that’s just as into symbolic
   gestures as he is. Throughout the movie, we see images of that insanity
   encroaching: piles of money burning, corpses dangling, a civic hero
   transformed into a hate-driven freak. It’s there in the filmmaking,
   too—in the drones and whines of the incredible score, in the way the
   disorienting cameras whirl around simple conversations. And of course,
   it’s there in Heath Ledger.

   Ledger’s whole performance was a focus of widespread fascination before
   the movie had even come out. Before The Dark Knight, most of us figured
   that Jack Nicholson had already been the definitive Joker in Tim
   Burton’s 1989 Batman. (In an interview before The Dark Knight’s
   release, Nicholson said that he was “furious” that nobody had called
   him to be in this new Batman movie.) But then Ledger died of an
   accidental overdose months before the movie came out. This was one of
   the most truly shocking celebrity deaths of this century. It was River
   Phoenix all over again: a charismatic and talented young star who’d
   already proven himself as a talent and who didn’t really give off the
   image of someone who had problems like that.

   Ledger’s death was sad, even for those of us who’d never met him. But
   I’ll speak only for myself here: In some dark and shitty corner of my
   mind, his death also made me more excited for the movie. Maybe, I
   thought, Ledger had pushed himself so far into darkness while making
   this movie that he didn’t fully know how to pull himself out. Maybe he
   had essentially killed himself in bringing this character to life. And
   maybe that deadly devotion would manifest itself onscreen.

   Ledger’s death lent the movie a weird romanticism, sort of like the one
   that Kurt Cobain’s suicide gave to Nirvana’s MTV Unplugged In New York.
   Suddenly, we knew we were watching a major artist giving his last major
   work. This is the wrong way to think. There’s nothing romantic about
   death by addiction. It’s messy and shitty and sad, and it doesn’t fit
   into the pat narratives that we come up with.

   And yet Ledger’s performance as the Joker really was magical—powerful
   enough that Nicholson’s Joker almost instantly became a faded footnote.
   As the Joker, Ledger is legitimately disgusting: dirty and scarred-up,
   with yellow teeth and a tongue that’s constantly darting in and out of
   his mouth, like a lizard’s. But he’s magnetic, too. He tells different
   stories about his scars, just so we’ll know that he’s always lying. He
   confounds criminals as badly as he does police. He dances his way
   through a hospital explosion and intimidates a roomful of mob bosses.
   His voice—the best description I can manage is a tweaked-out Richard
   Nixon impression—is chilling and alien. And he seems to be in love with
   Batman in ways that make even Batman uncomfortable: “Don’t talk like
   you’re one of them. You’re not.”

   The criminal-mastermind stuff in The Dark Knight is fun. Even when you
   know it’s coming, the Joker’s escape from the police station is
   gripping; he’s putting such work into his schemes. And nobody’s ever
   handled a bazooka as nonchalantly as Ledger does during that chase
   scene. But the real great thing about The Dark Knight is the way the
   Joker has no real purpose—how his purpose is purposelessness. He calls
   himself “an agent of chaos,” which is both on-the-nose and accurate. We
   never get a real origin story for this Joker. He doesn’t even have a
   name. He’s just a force, a walking human entropy, “nothing in his
   pockets but knives and lint.”

   He’s a hell of a storytelling device, too. Nolan’s real point with the
   movie, I think, is to illustrate how close so many of are to madness,
   how civilization is always hanging by a fragile thread. That’s why the
   movie’s central tragedy is in the way Harvey Dent falls apart, and
   that’s why Batman ends the movie by willingly transforming himself into
   a scapegoat. It’s a compelling arc, and yet Ledger’s Joker cuts such a
   powerful figure that it overwhelms the movie, turning both Dent and
   Batman into marginal figures. The most memorable image in the movie
   isn’t Dent’s Two-Face reveal or Batman disappearing back into shadow at
   the end. It’s the Joker, high on his own malevolence, hanging his head
   out of a cop-car window like he’s a dog.

   Maybe Nolan intended for this to happen, and maybe he didn’t. Either
   way, he put together a cultural sensation that still has its hooks in
   us. Think of the way so many stray phrases from that beautifully
   written script have seeped into the lexicon: “You either die a hero, or
   you live long enough to see yourself become the villain,” “some men
   just want to watch the world burn,” “destined to do this forever.” The
   Dark Knight has entered the collective unconscious. It’ll always be
   with us.

   And for that reason, I’d argue that The Dark Knight is the most
   important superhero movie in history, not just of 2008. The Dark Knight
   is the reason that the public at large is willing to take superhero
   movies so seriously. It’s the buzz that we’re still chasing. It’s the
   promise fulfilled. It’s a vast summer blockbuster made without even the
   slightest consideration given to entertaining children, which of course
   means that children love it. The Dark Knight is an influential movie,
   of course, with goobers like Zack Snyder and David Ayer attempting to
   use its all-pervading bad vibes in way more ham-fisted ways. But its
   importance goes far beyond that direct influence.

   Iron Man was a miracle, of course, but I’d argue that after that, the
   Marvel Cinematic Universe didn’t produce another actual good movie for
   another three years. And I think The Dark Knight, just as much as Iron
   Man, is the reason that the Marvel Cinematic Universe is still around
   and still dominating. The Dark Knight showed Hollywood studios, and the
   public at large, what a superhero movie could be. After that, everyone
   had to try a whole lot harder.

   Other notable 2008 superhero movies: We’ve already addressed Iron Man
   in some depth. There’s an argument to be made that Iron Man is the
   second-most important superhero movie ever made. Hell, there’s probably
   an argument that it’s the most important superhero movie.

   But we should also talk about The Incredible Hulk, Marvel’s other
   inaugural MCU offering. Maybe it was brave of Marvel to attempt a
   reboot of their big green rage-monster only five years after the Ang
   Lee version. And the movie has some fun scenes, like a battle between
   the Hulk and some Army troops on a college campus. But French
   action-movie auteur Louis Leterrier gave the movie a drab, flat look,
   and star Edward Norton rewrote the script, making it heavier than it
   had to be. Marvel learned its lesson, adapting a bright and shiny
   in-house look and jettisoning both Norton and Iron Man’s Terrence
   Howard for actors who would play ball. In making these moves, Marvel
   effectively killed the primacy of both stars and directors, recognizing
   the characters and the storylines as the real draws. So now The
   Incredible Hulk is a historic scrapheap curiosity.

   Another road-not-taken Marvel movie is Lexi Alexander’s almost
   hilariously violent Punisher: War Zone, the third and probably final
   attempt to turn Marvel’s brutal vigilante antihero into a movie’s
   leading man. In this one, Ray Stevenson plays Frank Castle as a
   gigantic stab-happy Jason Voorhees motherfucker, a stone-carved killing
   machine, while Alexander piles on the exaggerated slapstick gore and
   various character actors, led by Dominic West, do their best to make
   Castle’s victims into unsympathetic caricatures. Marvel is probably
   right that the Punisher is better in Netflix-miniseries form than as
   the star of a major motion picture, but I really love this movie’s
   hyper-violent absurdism.

   With Hellboy II: The Golden Army, future Oscar winner Guillermo del
   Toro brought back the beloved cult-comics figure he’d already adapted
   and pitted him against a horde of magical Celtic-myth elf-creatures.
   Del Toro’s never been afraid of silliness, and Hellboy II has plenty of
   that. But it’s also a movie full of imaginative monster designs and
   gorgeous fantastical images. I don’t think it’s a classic, the way some
   people do, but it is top-shelf stoner spectacle.

   Hancock is another curiosity: a big-budget summer movie about a newly
   invented superhero, a way-too-powerful unreliable drunk with mysterious
   origins and no idea how to function alongside the rest of society. The
   movie doesn’t altogether work, but it does make some fascinatingly
   strange turns, especially once we learn a few things about a couple of
   characters’ origins.

   With The Spirit, meanwhile, comics legend Frank Miller, directing by
   himself for the first time, tried to make a CGI-heavy noir adaptation
   out of Will Eisner’s foundational superhero comic strip. The result is
   a notorious disaster, a self-important work of aestheticized nonsense
   that wastes the talents of way too many movie stars who should’ve known
   better. It’s the sort of movie that forces us to reconsider whether
   Frank Miller really was ever that great or whether he was just skating
   through his career on one hard-boiled cliché after another.

   The Spirit villain Samuel L. Jackson, still in the process of becoming
   Nick Fury, was also a villain in Doug Liman’s Jumper, about a kid who
   discovers that he’s part of a secret teleporting race. The pretty-good
   animated movie Bolt gave us the story of a TV-actor dog who thinks he,
   like his TV character, has actual powers. Franklyn was a British movie
   with Ryan Phillippe as a masked crimefighter who travels between
   realities. The superhero-adjacent Wanted adapted a deeply toxic Mark
   Millar comic about a society of supernaturally gifted assassins.
   Meanwhile, the dumber-than-fuck parody Superhero Movie was a
   probably-premature joke-a-minute parody about the still-developing
   superhero-movie genre. But since the parody-movie genre was on its last
   legs at the time, and since the movie sucked, it didn’t make much
   impact.

   Next time: Zack Snyder adapts Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons’ foundational
   comic-book masterpiece Watchmen into a confounding big-budget movie.
