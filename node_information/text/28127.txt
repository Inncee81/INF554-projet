     * AMD Ryzen 9 3950X Packaging - Left Side

A Linux Performance Look At AMD’s 16-core Ryzen 9 3950X
       With so many CPUs hitting the market this month, it was time to
       both retest our collection of chips and update our tests. In this
       article, we’re going to be covering a bunch of workloads in Linux,
       ranging from compiling to rendering, compute to encryption. AMD’s
       new 16-core Ryzen 9 3950X joins ten other processors, so let’s see
       how it stacks up.

     * AMD Ryzen 9 Processor Packaging

A Quick Look At AMD’s 16-core Ryzen 9 3950X Processor
       We’re a little late on our full-blown look at AMD’s new sixteen
       core Ryzen 9 3950X, thanks in part to a recent suite overhaul
       that’s proving to take quite a while to run on each chip. We’re
       going to kick our coverage off with a quicker look at both
       rendering and encoding performance, so far comparing it to the
       3700X, 3900X, 2950X, and also Intel’s Core i9-9900K and 9900KS.

Eight Cores At 5GHz: Intel Core i9-9900KS Review
       With competition in the CPU market proving to be fiercer than ever,
       Intel has decided to haul out some big guns. “Big guns” in this
       case refers to eight cores running at 5GHz a piece. This comes to
       us in the form of the Core i9-9900KS, and you can join us as we pit
       it against the rest of our collection in creator and gaming
       workloads.

Corsair ONE i164 Compact Gaming PC Review
       How much performance can be had out of a super-small PC? If we base
       our opinions on Corsair’s ONE i164, the answer is a simple “a lot“.
       Coming in at 15-inches tall, this PC bundles not just Intel’s
       eight-core i9-9900K inside, but also NVIDIA’s top-end GeForce RTX
       2080 Ti. We recently battered the i164 with an obscene amount of
       testing, so let’s explore our findings.

A Linux For Speed Hounds: A Look At Clear Linux Performance
       We’ve heard lots about Clear Linux being a super-fast OS, so we’ve
       decided to put the claim to the test. With the help of our Core
       i9-9980XE test platform, we’re taking a look at performance in
       Intel’s Clear Linux, alongside five other distros, including the
       new Fedora 31 beta and Ubuntu 19.10. Even with the hardware
       remaining identical from distro to distro, some of the results are
       bound to surprise you.

Corsair K57 RGB Wireless Review – A Non-Mechanical Keyboard To Consider
       Keyboard snobs didn’t become snobs for no good reason. There are a
       lot of crappy keyboards out there. Many feel that a keyboard that
       doesn’t have mechanical switches in it are not worthy of their
       attention, and in the past this has been a good argument. With
       advancements in rubber dome-switches and the like, do they deserve
       another chance?

Steam Beta Reveals Valve Is Planning To Expand To Cloud Gaming

   it seems safe enough to assume that’s correct. But Qualcomm is putting
