   Lebanon

   Expertise France has been operating in Lebanon for a number of years,
   which demonstrates the close cooperation between this country and
   France. The agency is currently implementing 12 technical assistance
   projects, including 6 regional projects, for a total amount of some EUR
   36m. Expertise France’s activities in Lebanon mainly aim to build the
   capacities of national and local public administrations, support
   private sector development, and promote social cohesion in order to
   reduce tensions related to the consequences of the Syrian crisis. It
   mainly operates with funds from the European Union and France.

   Following the creation of the MADAD fund, which was set up to meet the
   needs of neighbouring countries affected by the Syrian and Iraqi
   crises, Expertise France became involved in the EUR 78m Qudra regional
   programme, alongside GIZ and AECID. This programme aims to provide a
   coherent European response to the consequences of these crises in terms
   of population displacements in neighbouring countries. In Lebanon, this
   programme specifically aims to strengthen social stability between host
   and refugee communities and meets the needs of refugees in terms of
   educational assistance, vocational training, psychosocial support and
   access to information. It also aims to provide technical assistance to
   communities hosting refugees.

   Since 2016, Expertise France has been conducting a private sector
   development support project in Lebanon. This EU-funded EUR 15m project
   aims to support micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) in
   the fruit, vegetable and wood sectors in order to develop synergies in
   each sector and strengthen the value chain, in particular via the
   creation of clusters.

   Expertise France has been assisting and supporting the Lebanese
   Institute of Finance since it was set up in 1996. This long-standing
   partnership is part of a Memorandum of Understanding between the French
   Ministry of Economy and Finance and Lebanese Ministry of Finance. The
   Institute contributes to building the capacities of officials from
   Lebanon’s public administration and to supporting reforms, particularly
   in the field of public finances. Today, the Institute has regional
   outreach and actively participates in cooperation actions with other
   countries in the region.

An unprecedented crisis

   The Middle East is currently undergoing a profound crisis. The war in
   Syria and Iraq has destabilised neighbouring countries. There are
   currently 4.8 milllion Syrian refugees scattered across Jordan,
   Lebanon, Turkey and Iraq. The arrival of these refugees has put great
   pressure on local infrastructure, economy and services - all of which
   have reached saturation point.

   Supporting these countries has become all the more crucial as, in the
   long term, these countries will not be able to cope with the refugee
   crisis without the help of the international community. The return of
   these refugees is a long-term process which will outrun the end of the
   crisis. Most of these refugees have to face a number of different
   problems such as status, protection, access to public services,
   education and employment. Professional training and education are
   essential if the refugees are to participate in the local economy and a
   necessary investment in the reintegration of the refugees into a post
   conflict environnement.

   The Qudra Programme is a regional action financed by the EU Regional
   Trust Fund in Response to the Syrian Crisis, the ‘Madad’ Fund and the
   German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ)
   seeking to strengthen resilience for Syrian refugees, IDPs and host
   communities in response to the Syrian and Iraqi crises. The programme
   is jointly implemented by the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale
   Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH, Expertise France and the Spanish Agency for
   International Development (AECID).

QUDRA en Turquie

   L’éducation et la formation technique et professionnelle sont centrales
   pour favoriser la participation et l’intégration des réfugiés au sein
   des communautés qui les accueillent.

   A Istanbul, des activités mises en œuvre en partenariat avec une ONG
   locale

   En Turquie, Expertise France soutient donc le centre pour la jeunesse
   d’Istanbul afin de proposer des activités sociales et formatrices aux
   jeunes syriens et turcs de 13 à 22 ans.

   A la frontière turco-syrienne, des centres communautaires pris en
   charge par un consortium de 5 ONG

   L’agence travaille avec les centres d’éducation publique de Gaziantep,
   Hatay et Şanliurfa pour renforcer la résilience des jeunes adultes dans
   ces régions limitrophes de la Syrie.

QUDRA in Lebanon: Community and Learning Centers in the Bekaa Valley

   Expertise France focuses its strategy on reinforcing the capacities of
   the civil society via 4 Lebanese and Syrian NGOs, recognised for their
   expertise in the sector and their methods of intervention. These
   partners work together to bring a collective response to the needs of
   host communities and refugees.

   Their activies are deployed through the creation of 4 semi-permanent
   community centres. Expertise France accompanies NGO partners in the
   development and implementation of the programme, as well as the
   construction of the 4 centres where Expertise France manages the
   coordination team and sector experts.

Support to children activities for Lebanese and Syrian children

     * Fight against poor performance at school and dropping out of
       Lebanese and Syrian children
     * Provide refresher courses for Syrian children that have not
       received any form of education for several years and facilitate
       their integration back into the Lebanese education system.

Training activities for young Lebanese and Syrians adults.

     * Provide basic training to Lebanese and Syrians in the most deprived
       communitites to help them find employment or develop a central role
       within their communities.

Protection activities

     * Provide psychosocial support to vulnerable or traumatised Lebanese
       and Syrian communities
     * Carry out awareness and risk prevention campaigns (especially
       violence towards women and children)

Collect and communicate information concerning refugee rights

     * Enable local communities (NGOs and local councils) to generate and
       communicate reliable information concerning refugee rights and
       duties.

   This activity is implemented by CFI.

QUDRA in Jordan: strengthening social cohesion through community-based
information services

   To foster social cohesion between refugees and local population in host
   communities in Jordan, QUDRA activities under this component seek to
   improve access of Syrian refugees to information and particularly to
   enhance their knowledge of their rights and duties in all relevant
   fields (protection, education, health, housing, right to work,
   municipal services and access to justice and legal aid) and enhance
   their ability to exercise them.

   To maximize efficiency, the activities will be implemented around
   already existing assistance programmes and related information systems
   primarily through well-designed outreach campaigns.

   In Jordan, activities are implemented by CFI.

Stability and crisis management
       Expertise France works to stabilise regions in situations of crisis
       and fragility or conflict-affected regions. Expertise France’s
       approach is based on the implementation of early recovery projects
       in crisis areas. Right from the immediate crisis response, it
       involves integrating measures to ensure the sustainability of
       actions and to build the capacities of governance structures,
       States, regional and local authorities, NGOs, civil society and
       populations, and their resilience.

An unprecedented crisis

   The Middle East is currently undergoing a profound crisis. The war in
   Syria and Iraq has destabilised neighbouring countries. There are
   currently 4.8 milllion Syrian refugees scattered across Jordan,
   Lebanon, Turkey and Iraq. The arrival of these refugees has put great
   pressure on local infrastructure, economy and services - all of which
   have reached saturation point.

   Supporting these countries has become all the more crucial as, in the
   long term, these countries will not be able to cope with the refugee
   crisis without the help of the international community. The return of
   these refugees is a long-term process which will outrun the end of the
   crisis. Most of these refugees have to face a number of different
   problems such as status, protection, access to public services,
   education and employment. Professional training and education are
   essential if the refugees are to participate in the local economy and a
   necessary investment in the reintegration of the refugees into a post
   conflict environnement.

   The Qudra Programme is a regional action financed by the EU Regional
   Trust Fund in Response to the Syrian Crisis, the ‘Madad’ Fund and the
   German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ)
   seeking to strengthen resilience for Syrian refugees, IDPs and host
   communities in response to the Syrian and Iraqi crises. The programme
   is jointly implemented by the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale
   Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH, Expertise France and the Spanish Agency for
   International Development (AECID).

QUDRA en Turquie

   L’éducation et la formation technique et professionnelle sont centrales
   pour favoriser la participation et l’intégration des réfugiés au sein
   des communautés qui les accueillent.

   A Istanbul, des activités mises en œuvre en partenariat avec une ONG
   locale

   En Turquie, Expertise France soutient donc le centre pour la jeunesse
   d’Istanbul afin de proposer des activités sociales et formatrices aux
   jeunes syriens et turcs de 13 à 22 ans.

   A la frontière turco-syrienne, des centres communautaires pris en
   charge par un consortium de 5 ONG

   L’agence travaille avec les centres d’éducation publique de Gaziantep,
   Hatay et Şanliurfa pour renforcer la résilience des jeunes adultes dans
   ces régions limitrophes de la Syrie.

QUDRA in Lebanon: Community and Learning Centers in the Bekaa Valley

   Expertise France focuses its strategy on reinforcing the capacities of
   the civil society via 4 Lebanese and Syrian NGOs, recognised for their
   expertise in the sector and their methods of intervention. These
   partners work together to bring a collective response to the needs of
   host communities and refugees.

   Their activies are deployed through the creation of 4 semi-permanent
   community centres. Expertise France accompanies NGO partners in the
   development and implementation of the programme, as well as the
   construction of the 4 centres where Expertise France manages the
   coordination team and sector experts.

Support to children activities for Lebanese and Syrian children

     * Fight against poor performance at school and dropping out of
       Lebanese and Syrian children
     * Provide refresher courses for Syrian children that have not
       received any form of education for several years and facilitate
       their integration back into the Lebanese education system.

Training activities for young Lebanese and Syrians adults.

     * Provide basic training to Lebanese and Syrians in the most deprived
       communitites to help them find employment or develop a central role
       within their communities.

Protection activities

     * Provide psychosocial support to vulnerable or traumatised Lebanese
       and Syrian communities
     * Carry out awareness and risk prevention campaigns (especially
       violence towards women and children)

Collect and communicate information concerning refugee rights

     * Enable local communities (NGOs and local councils) to generate and
       communicate reliable information concerning refugee rights and
       duties.

   This activity is implemented by CFI.

QUDRA in Jordan: strengthening social cohesion through community-based
information services

   To foster social cohesion between refugees and local population in host
   communities in Jordan, QUDRA activities under this component seek to
   improve access of Syrian refugees to information and particularly to
   enhance their knowledge of their rights and duties in all relevant
   fields (protection, education, health, housing, right to work,
   municipal services and access to justice and legal aid) and enhance
   their ability to exercise them.

   To maximize efficiency, the activities will be implemented around
   already existing assistance programmes and related information systems
   primarily through well-designed outreach campaigns.

   In Jordan, activities are implemented by CFI.

Stability and crisis management
       Expertise France works to stabilise regions in situations of crisis
       and fragility or conflict-affected regions. Expertise France’s
       approach is based on the implementation of early recovery projects
       in crisis areas. Right from the immediate crisis response, it
       involves integrating measures to ensure the sustainability of
       actions and to build the capacities of governance structures,
       States, regional and local authorities, NGOs, civil society and
       populations, and their resilience.
