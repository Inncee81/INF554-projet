   US government to impose tariffs on EU aircraft and agricultural
   products
   Closing Bell

   The U.S. will impose tariffs on European Union goods after a victory at
   the World Trade Organization, according to senior officials from the
   Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.

   The USTR released a list Wednesday of products it plans to target,
   intensifying the Trump administration's global trade battles. The
   duties would take effect Oct. 18. The duties include:
     * 10% tariffs on aircraft from France, Germany, Spain or the United
       Kingdom
     * 25% duties on single-malt Irish and Scotch whiskies, various
       garments and blankets from the U.K.
     * 25% tariffs on coffee and certain tools and machinery from Germany
     * 25% duties on various cheeses, olive oil and frozen meat from
       Germany, Spain and the U.K.
     * 25% tariffs on certain pork products, butter and yogurt from
       multiple countries

   Earlier, the WTO gave the Trump administration the right to put tariffs
   on $7.5 billion in European goods. The U.S. had lodged complaints,
   first in 2004, over what it called illegal subsidies for aircraft maker
   Airbus by several European governments.

   U.S. officials contend the EU has "no basis" to retaliate against the
   planned duties. The USTR said it asked the WTO to schedule an Oct. 14
   meeting to approve a U.S. request to take the countermeasures against
   the EU.

   It was not immediately clear if the value of the products on the USTR
   list was $7.5 billion or less than that.

   The action escalates conflicts the Trump administration has waged
   around the globe as it tries to get major trade partners to change
   their practices. The U.S. is locked in a trade war with China as it
   struggles to strike a new agreement with the world's second-largest
   economy.

   The news of a widening trade conflict follows a day of trading when
   major U.S. stock indexes each fell more than 1.5% amid fears of a
   slowing economy. Investors have worried about sustained trade wars
   dragging on global growth and potentially pulling the U.S. into a
   recession.

   Airlines decried the move Wednesday. In a statement, Delta said,
   "Imposing tariffs on aircraft that U.S. companies have already
   committed to will inflict serious harm on U.S. airlines, the millions
   of Americans they employ and the traveling public." Meanwhile, JetBlue
   said that it is "concerned about the detrimental impact aircraft
   tariffs will have on the ability for low-cost carries like JetBlue to
   grow and compete."

   Reacting to the WTO decision earlier, European Commissioner for Trade
   Cecilia Malmstrom said new U.S. tariffs would be "short-sighted and
   counterproductive." She left the door open to the EU levying
   retaliatory duties.

   Trump has long decried what he calls unfair trade practices by the EU.
   His administration increased tensions with the bloc when he put tariffs
   on steel and aluminum imports from Europe last year. In response, the
   EU slapped duties on about $3 billion in American goods, including
   bourbon and motorcycles.

   Trump has also threatened duties on cars and auto imports from Europe.
   In May, the administration delayed those tariffs for up to six months.

   The U.S. sent about $319 billion in goods to the EU countries combined
   in 2018, making them the largest American export market. The U.S.
   imported about $488 billion in products from the EU, and the nations
   combined are America's second-largest supplier of goods.

Credit Suisse has a word to describe this sluggish economy — a
'semi-recession'

   Published Thu, Oct 3 20198:21 AM EDTUpdated 2 hours ago
   Maggie Fitzgerald@mkmfitzgerald
   Key Points
     * Credit Suisse says the economy is in a "semi-recession."
     * The firm said weak manufacturing data accompanied by healthy
       economic data elsewhere lands the economy in a middle ground.
     * Credit Suisse's chief U.S. equity strategist, Jonathan Golub, noted
       that inflation, jobs data and credit performance are all still
       expansionary for the economy.

   Investors and economists are chasing a moving target of strong and weak
   economic data, making it increasingly confusing what the state of the
   economy really is.

   Credit Suisse said weak manufacturing data accompanied by healthy
   economic data elsewhere lands the economy in a middle ground.

   "While investors debate whether we're entering a recession, we believe
   the backdrop is better described as a 'Semi-Recession,'" Jonathan
   Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse, said in a note to
   clients Wednesday.

   A gauge of the U.S. manufacturing sector released Tuesday showed the
   lowest reading in more than a decade for September as exports fell amid
   the U.S.-China trade war. The ISM U.S. manufacturing purchasing
   managers' index came in at 47.8% for the month, the lowest since June
   2009. Any reading below 50 signals a contraction.

   [20191001 Manufacturing PMI decline jws.1570102450436.png]

   Meanwhile, industrial production has been in a yearlong deceleration,
   despite a positive reading in August. Manufacturing, which accounts for
   about 11% of the U.S. economy, is being hurt by the trade war between
   the United States and China and slowing global economic growth. The
   0.6% increase in industrial production in August was the largest gain
   in industrial output since August 2018 and followed a 0.1% dip in July,
   according to the Federal Reserve.

   Alongside weak manufacturing data, the yield curve is inverted on the
   short end, meaning the 10-year Treasury note has a lower yield than the
   3-month Treasury bill. This bond market phenomena is regarded as a
   recessionary signal.

   "Recessionary risks are clearly rising," said Golub. "Absent a
   reacceleration in cyclical data, stock upside appears limited," he
   said.

   To be sure, Golub said, "recessionary indicators have weakened but do
   not point to a broad-based downturn."

   Weak data is offset by a strong labor market, Golub said. September's
   jobs report, set to be released Friday, is expected to show 148,000 new
   payrolls and jobless claims continue to decline, he said.

   Golub noted inflation, jobs data and credit performance are all still
   expansionary for the economy. While earnings and housing activity are
   neutral.

The Dow dropped more than 800 points in two days — here's what's going on

   Key Points
     * The Dow Jones Industrial Average falls for a second day on
       Wednesday, bringing its two-day losses to start October to 838
       points.
     * The drop in the Dow comes after reports show slowing in September
       for both manufacturing and hiring.
     * The two economic warning signs come as President Donald Trump faces
       a push for impeachment by Democrats.
     * The S&P 500 falls below its 50-day moving average, a key technical
       indicator watched by analysts, on Tuesday.

   Dow plunges more than 400 points on recession fears—Five pros discuss
   Trading Nation

   Stock indexes were nearing record high levels, until October and the
   fourth quarter began.

   In the last two days the U.S. markets have fallen broadly, as investors
   began showing concern about fresh signs of an economic slowdown.

   The Dow Jones Industrial Average's losses deepened on Wednesday,
   bringing its two-day decline to 838 points. The Dow has lost 3.1% so
   far this quarter, already wiping out the 1.2% gain of the third
   quarter. It remains up 11.8% for the year.

   [DJI_chart (13).1570046765986.jpeg]

Economy

   The drop in the Dow began after a key measure of U.S. manufacturing saw
   its lowest reading in more than 10 years on Tuesday. September's
   reading of manufacturing data from the Institute of Supply Management,
   or ISM, came in at 47.85% — the second consecutive month of contract
   for the index. Any reading of the ISM index below 50% signals a
   contraction.

   [20191001 Manufacturing PMI decline
   jws.1569942352092.1570040379246.png]

   Shortly behind last month's slowdown in manufacturing was the month's
   private payrolls report on Wednesday, which revealed that the pace of
   hiring is easing as the labor market continues to tighten. ADP and
   Moody's Analytics said companies hired an additional 135,000 workers in
   September, a slowing from 157,000 hirings during the previous month.
   What's more, the August numbers were revised sharply lower, as there
   were 195,000 more workers previously reported for the month.

Impeachment

   The two economic warning signs come as President Donald Trump faces a
   push for impeachment from Democrats, who want to see Trump removed
   on allegations that he abused his power as president. The possibility
   of impeachment has been negative for U.S. stocks, although some
   investors say that if Trump is removed there may be a Clinton-like
   rally in equities.

   One of the main concerns from investors is that impeachment proceedings
   will undermine trade negotiations, especially with China. Last week
   Washington policy analysts warned clients that an impeachment inquiry
   is likely to waylay the U.S. from passing the United
   States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, or from coming to a
   resolution with Beijing. With the escalating trade war weighing on U.S.
   companies, Wall Street remains concerned that Trump will not be able to
   reach a deal that would result in the removal of the tariffs on
   billions of dollars worth of imports.

Technical breakdown

   On Tuesday, the S&P 500 fell below its 50-day moving average, a key
   technical indicator watched by analysts. Bespoke Investment Group noted
   on Wednesday that, for the first time in the index's history, the S&P
   500 began October with back-to-back drops of more than 1% each.
   Additionally, the drop of 2.99% was the fourth-worst start to the
   fourth quarter for the S&P 500 in its history — just shy of the 3.01%
   drop at the beginning of 2009's fourth quarter.

   Both the Dow and S&P 500 finished the third quarter of the calendar
   year just below the all-time highs hit in July, so this has been a
   rapid turn of events.

   Digitization has an important role to play when it comes to how small
   and medium enterprises operate, the CEO of Spanish firm Cyberclick said
   Wednesday.
   During a panel discussion at Innovation Summit Barcelona chaired by
   CNBC's Steve Sedgwick, David Tomas was asked whether digitization
   created happiness.
   "I think it can, it definitely can," he said, going on to explain that
   this was particularly the case if one talked about how a company was
   organized.
   "You were mentioning that a lot of people, they don't want to work for
   a bigger company and that's mainly because we know how big companies
   work – I mean, it's hard," he added. "It's a lot of processes,
   miscommunications, too hierarchic."
   One of the opportunities brought by digitization, Tomas explained, was
   to make "flatter" companies with new ways of communicating and "having
   the chance to change the way we work."
   "For me, that would be one of the key points: that we should use
   technology to improve the way we work, to improve our experience and,
   at the end of the day, that will make us happier."
   Technology is undoubtedly changing the way we work, with high speed
   internet connections making it easier for people to work remotely and
   interact with colleagues using video calls, instant messaging services
   and email.

   Back in Barcelona, Cyberclick's David Tomas went on to talk about the
   wider implications of tech. "I think technology – if we use it properly
   – definitely it's going to help us," he said. "The thing is how we use
   it and there's no manual, we need to learn to do that, and maybe it's
   (to) disconnect, or for some other people it's connecting more," he
   added.
   "Whatever it is… we have to look for the opportunity to use digital
   solutions to improve our companies and our life."
