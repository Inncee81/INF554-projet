Comics at the New York Public Library

   The New York Public Library is delighted to celebrate the creative
   attributes of comics. The Library holds an extensive collection of
   comics spanning the medium’s history. Students, artists, and comic book
   aficionados visit the Library to learn about the historical, cultural,
   and visual aspects of the art of graphic storytelling—an art that
   continues to grow in popularity and reach new audiences. Shown here
   from the Library’s collections are works by the legendary comic book
   writer Stan Lee, as well as works from the James Wright Brown Cartoon
   Collection and works by Latin American, Iberian, and North American
   Latino writers and artists.

   Stan Lee
   The man who revolutionized the comic book industry and became a leading
   pioneer for the medium, Stan Lee (1922–2018) was a comic book writer,
   editor, and publisher whose work and characters are visually recognized
   throughout the world and are rising ever upward. Excelsior!

   Latin American, Iberian & U.S. Latino Comics
   In celebration of National Hispanic Heritage Month, this exhibition
   highlights Latin American, Iberian, and Latinx comics from the
   collection. The Library’s General Research Division collects broadly
   from Latin America, the Iberian peninsula, and the United States. This
   includes the Latino Comic Book Collection of over 370 comics, with
   works published from 1970 to the present.

   James Wright Brown Cartoon Collection
   In 1948, the Library was presented with the James Wright Brown Cartoon
   Collection of more than 800 original drawings by leading cartoonists
   representing the first half of the 20th century. The collection was
   donated to the Print Collection by James Wright Brown who served as
   editor-in-chief, president, and chairman of Editor & Publisher, a major
   newspaper trade journal.

   Open now. Ends October 10th, 2019. Stephen A. Schwarzman Building,

   Performing Arts.

Archive in Motion: 75 Years of the Jerome Robbins Dance Division

   The Jerome Robbins Dance Division celebrates its 75th year with an
   exhibition that charts its history and the establishment of
   international dance archival practices through the display of
   significant items from its collections.

   Originally called the Dance Collection and housed at the Stephen A.
   Schwarzman Building at 42nd Street, in the 75 years since its creation,
   The New York Public Library’s Dance Division has become the world’s
   preeminent collection of dance research materials. Renamed in honor of
   Jerome Robbins — one of the Dance Division’s greatest supporters — in
   1999, the Division not only houses its name sake's vast collection, but
   is the leading international repository for the history of dance, with
   documentation that dates back to 1453 and representation for dance of
   all styles from around the world. The archive includes irreplaceable
   film that dates back to 1897; unique designs by visual artists;
   choreographic notation; photographs; manuscript collections; shoes and
   many more examples of ephemera. When taken together, these materials
   provide the opportunity to fleetingly recapture the most elusive of the
   performing arts.



   Open now. Ends January 25th, 2020. New York Public Library for the
   Performing Arts, Dorothy and Lewis B. Cullman Center, Shelby Cullom
   Davis Museum, Vincent Astor Gallery

Comics at the New York Public Library

   The New York Public Library is delighted to celebrate the creative
   attributes of comics. The Library holds an extensive collection of
   comics spanning the medium’s history. Students, artists, and comic book
   aficionados visit the Library to learn about the historical, cultural,
   and visual aspects of the art of graphic storytelling—an art that
   continues to grow in popularity and reach new audiences. Shown here
   from the Library’s collections are works by the legendary comic book
   writer Stan Lee, as well as works from the James Wright Brown Cartoon
   Collection and works by Latin American, Iberian, and North American
   Latino writers and artists.

   Stan Lee
   The man who revolutionized the comic book industry and became a leading
   pioneer for the medium, Stan Lee (1922–2018) was a comic book writer,
   editor, and publisher whose work and characters are visually recognized
   throughout the world and are rising ever upward. Excelsior!

   Latin American, Iberian & U.S. Latino Comics
   In celebration of National Hispanic Heritage Month, this exhibition
   highlights Latin American, Iberian, and Latinx comics from the
   collection. The Library’s General Research Division collects broadly
   from Latin America, the Iberian peninsula, and the United States. This
   includes the Latino Comic Book Collection of over 370 comics, with
   works published from 1970 to the present.

   James Wright Brown Cartoon Collection
   In 1948, the Library was presented with the James Wright Brown Cartoon
   Collection of more than 800 original drawings by leading cartoonists
   representing the first half of the 20th century. The collection was
   donated to the Print Collection by James Wright Brown who served as
   editor-in-chief, president, and chairman of Editor & Publisher, a major
   newspaper trade journal.

Archive in Motion: 75 Years of the Jerome Robbins Dance Division

   The Jerome Robbins Dance Division celebrates its 75th year with an
   exhibition that charts its history and the establishment of
   international dance archival practices through the display of
   significant items from its collections.

   Originally called the Dance Collection and housed at the Stephen A.
   Schwarzman Building at 42nd Street, in the 75 years since its creation,
   The New York Public Library’s Dance Division has become the world’s
   preeminent collection of dance research materials. Renamed in honor of
   Jerome Robbins — one of the Dance Division’s greatest supporters — in
   1999, the Division not only houses its name sake's vast collection, but
   is the leading international repository for the history of dance, with
   documentation that dates back to 1453 and representation for dance of
   all styles from around the world. The archive includes irreplaceable
   film that dates back to 1897; unique designs by visual artists;
   choreographic notation; photographs; manuscript collections; shoes and
   many more examples of ephemera. When taken together, these materials
   provide the opportunity to fleetingly recapture the most elusive of the
   performing arts.



   Open now. Ends January 25th, 2020. New York Public Library for the
   Performing Arts, Dorothy and Lewis B. Cullman Center, Shelby Cullom
   Davis Museum, Vincent Astor Gallery
