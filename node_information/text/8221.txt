Africa development bank says risks to growth 'increasing by the day'

   Nuzulack Dausen

   3 Min Read

   DAR ES SALAAM (Reuters) - The U.S.-China trade war and uncertainty over
   Brexit pose risks to Africa’s economic prospects that are “increasing
   by the day,” the head of the African Development Bank (AfDB) told
   Reuters.

   The trade dispute between the world’s two largest economies has roiled
   global markets and unnerved investors as it stretches into its second
   year with no end in sight.

   Britain, meanwhile, appears to be on course to leave the European Union
   on Oct. 31 without a transition deal, which economists fear could
   severely disrupt trade flows.

       Akinwumi Adesina, president of the AfDB, said the bank could review
   its economic growth projection for Africa - of 4% in 2019 and 4.1% in
   2020 - if global external shocks accelerate.

   “We normally revise this depending on global external shocks that could
   slowdown global growth and these issues are increasing by the day,”
   Adesina told Reuters late on Saturday on the sidelines of the Southern
   African Development Community meeting in Tanzania’s commercial capital
   Dar es Salaam.

       “You have Brexit, you also have the recent challenges between
   Pakistan and India that have flared off there, plus you have the trade
   war between the United States and China. All these things can combine
   to slow global growth, with implications for African countries.”

       The bank chief said African nations need to boost trade with each
   other and add value to agricultural produce to cushion the impact of
   external shocks.

       “I think the trade war has significantly impacted economic growth
   prospects in China and therefore import demand from China has fallen
   significantly and so demand for products and raw materials from Africa
   will only fall even further,” he said.

       “It will also have another effect with regard to China’s own
   outward-bound investments on the continent,” he added, saying these
   could also affect official development assistance.

       Adesina said a continental free-trade zone launched last month, the
   African Continental Free Trade Area, could help speed up economic
   growth and development, but African nations needed to remove non-tariff
   barriers to boost trade.

       “The countries that have always been facing lower volatilities have
   always been the ones that do a lot more in terms of regional trade and
   do not rely on exports of raw materials,” Adesina said.

       “The challenges cannot be solved unless all the barriers come down.
   Free mobility of labour, free mobility of capital and free mobility of
   people.”

   The trade dispute between the world’s two largest economies has roiled
