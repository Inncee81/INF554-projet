   The whistleblower complaint that reportedly centers on President Donald
   Trump and his interactions with Ukraine has been declassified, sources
   familiar with the matter told NBC News on Wednesday night.

   The complaint, which the administration initially withheld from
   Congress, was declassified with what were described as minimal
   redactions, the sources said, and there is an expectation that it will
   be released Thursday morning.

   It is thought to be related to a July phone call between Trump and
   Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.

   The details have not been made public, though it has widely been
   reported that the complaint involves Trump, funding for Ukraine and an
   attempt to get information about former Vice President Joe Biden and
   his family. The complaint is at the center of a standoff between the
   White House and Congress that led to a formal impeachment inquiry
   against Trump.

   The White House has not responded to the reported declassification of
   the complaint.

   The complaint was released to Congress on Wednesday, and Democrats who
   read it described it as containing important new information, even
   though they couldn't discuss what the information was.

   House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff, D.-Calif, said
   Wednesday the allegations in the complaint were "very credible" and
   "deeply disturbing.”

   "The complaint is very well written, and certainly provides information
   for the committee to follow up with other witnesses and documents," he
   said.

   The complaint was filed last month by the acting inspector general for
   Director of National Intelligence, who found it to be "credible" and
   "urgent." It was supposed to be turned over to Congress within a week,
   but acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire refused to
   do so on the advice of the Justice Department.

witnesses'

   The whistleblower has not been identified. The legal team representing
   the whistleblower, who they say is a member of the intelligence
   community, said they welcomed its release.

   “We applaud the decision to release the whistleblower complaint as it
   establishes that, ultimately, the lawful whistleblower disclosure
   process can work,” attorneys Andrew P. Bakaj, I. Charles McCullough III
   and Mark S. Zaid said in a statement. “We await the release of the
   complaint in its totality,” the attorneys said.

   Earlier Wednesday, the White House released a description of the call
   between Trump and Zelenskiy that showed Trump asked him to look into
   why that country's top prosecutor apparently had ended an investigation
   of the business dealings of Joe Biden’s son, who served on the board of
   a Ukrainian gas company.

   Trump said Wednesday that he applied "no pressure whatsoever" in his
   phone call with Ukraine’s president. He said it was "friendly" and that
   the media built it up to be the "call from hell" and it turned out to
   be "nothing."

   Democrats widely expressed outrage over the contents of the description
   of the phone call released by the Trump administration.

   Biden, who is running for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination,
   said Trump "put personal politics above his sacred oath" and accused
   the president of having "put his own political interests over our
   national security interest, which is bolstering Ukraine against Russian
   pressure."

   The White House noted that the summary of the call was not a verbatim
   transcript and that it represented a record of "the notes and
   recollections of Situation Room Duty officers and National Security
   Council policy staff" who listen to official conversations.

Democrats view 'deeply disturbing' whistleblower complaint about Trump

   "I think it's a travesty that this complaint was withheld as long as it
   was because it was an urgent matter and it is an urgent matter," Schiff
   said.

   By Dareh Gregorian and Frank Thorp V

   The whistleblower complaint at the heart of a weeks-long standoff
   between the White House and Congress that led to a formal impeachment
   inquiry was finally made available to lawmakers on Wednesday. And
   Democrats who read it said it contained important new information, even
   though they couldn't discuss what it was.

   The document by the still-unidentified whistleblower contained
   allegations that were "very credible" and "deeply disturbing," said
   House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff, D.-Calif. The
   complaint is believed to be related to a July phone call between
   President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.

   "The complaint is very well written, and certainly provides information
   for the committee to follow up with other witnesses and documents,"
   Schiff, who was among the lawmakers permitted to view the classified
   complaint, said.

   The complaint was filed last month by the acting inspector general for
   Director of National Intelligence, who found it to be "credible" and
   "urgent." It was supposed to be turned over to Congress within a week,
   but the acting Director of National Intelligence, Joseph Maguire,
   refused to do so on the advice of the Justice Department.

   "I think it's a travesty that this complaint was withheld as long as it
   was because it was an urgent matter and it is an urgent matter, and
   there was simply no basis to keep this from the committee," Schiff
   said.

   "The idea that the Department of Justice would have intervened to
   prevent it from getting to Congress throws the leadership of the that
   department into further ill repute," Schiff said.

Schiff: Whistleblower complaint has 'information for ... follow up with other
witnesses'

   Sept. 25, 201901:17

   Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., said there are "really troubling things here."

   “Republicans ought not to be rushing to circle the wagons to say
   there’s no there there when there’s obviously lots that’s very
   troubling there," Sasse, a former Trump critic who was recently
   endorsed by the president, told reporters. He also chided Democrats
   "for using words like impeachment."

   "Everybody in this whole process should slow down," he said.

   He and other lawmakers from the intelligence committees were allowed to
   review the document in a secure location in the Capitol, as was
   Congressional leadership.

   Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., told reporters that
   “having read the documents in there I’m even more worried about what
   happened than I was when I read the memorandum of the conversation.
   There are so many facts have to be examined."

   "It’s very troubling," he added in a statement a short time later. “The
   public has a right to read the whistleblower’s complaint for
   themselves. The contents of the complaint should be made public
   immediately."

   Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., also called for the document to be made
   public.

   "I do not support impeachment of President Trump," she tweeted after
   reviewing the complaint, but "I believe strongly in transparency and it
   should be immediately declassified and made public for the American
   people to read."

   The document was made available hours after text of the July phone call
   was released. Maguire is scheduled to testify about the dispute in
   appearances before the House and Senate on Thursday.

   Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., said his level of concern was "no higher than it
   was before I read the complaint."

   “I want to sort out the different views of what I read before I decide
   whether I’m concerned with what I read or not,” he said.

   Rep. Joaquín Castro, D-Texas, and Rep. Jackie Speier, a Democrat from
   California, had different takeaways.

   "Just read the Whistleblower report," Castro tweeted. "This thing is
   bigger that I thought."

   "I can describe that complaint as nothing short of explosive," Speier
   said on MSNBC Wednesday night.

   CORRECTION (Sept. 25, 2019, 10:30 p.m. ET): An earlier version of this
   article misspelled the first name of a congressman from Texas. He is
   Joaquín Castro, not Joauquin.

   WASHINGTON — Even as they publicly insist President Donald Trump did
   nothing wrong during his call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr
   Zelenskiy, his allies are privately acknowledging more serious concerns
   about the ethical questions raised and the potential political fallout
   from it — especially over the involvement of Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s
   personal attorney.

   Two Trump allies, one of whom is a former senior White House official,
   described a level of concern inside the White House that is far greater
   than Trump and his supporters have publicly acknowledged. The former
   official added that Giuliani’s role is particularly problematic legally
   because Giuliani has purely political and personal ties to Trump and
   has no official role with the U.S. government.

   "It’s both better than I think many of us thought given what some of
   the speculation was, and also worse than many of us thought given what
   some of the speculation was," the official said. "The way in which it’s
   worse than people thought basically has to do with Giuliani."

   Another Trump ally said they didn’t think Trump’s conduct as revealed
   by the memo is impeachable, but acknowledged the ethical questions
   raised. That ally specifically raised concerns about Trump mentioning
   Biden's name in the call, rather than just corruption more broadly.

   “I wish he hadn’t said it — the Biden line,” that Trump ally said.

   Still, another source close to the president pointed to what so far has
   been a solid wall of Republican support, even as House Democrats begin
   an official impeachment inquiry. No Republican lawmakers have joined
   Democrats in saying they support some type of action towards
   impeachment.

   Giuliani has tried to deflect criticism about his involvement in
   diplomatic issues by saying that he acted at the request of and in
   coordination with the State Department.

   But while the State Department has acknowledged that one of its
   officials put Giuliani in touch with a top aide to the Ukrainian
   president at that aide’s request, the agency has otherwise tried to
   distance itself from Giuliani and his efforts in Ukraine. The State
   Department has described Giuliani as a private citizen who does not
   speak for the U.S. government.

   And a senior Trump administration official said that Giuliani’s claim
   that the State Department “asked me” to look into Ukraine or initiated
   his interactions with Ukraine’s government is false.

   The former senior White House official also said that Giuliani's claim
   that he worked through the State Department to coordinate his talks is
   highly questionable. The former official said that Giuliani should have
   “nothing to do with any of this stuff” and that his involvement in
   pursuing a corruption investigation “makes it inherently political
   rather than official law enforcement."

   "It’s Giuliani who’s really dragged the president into something that’s
   a legal matter and a political matter and will be part of impeachment,"
   the former official said. "What Giuliani did, there's no argument that
   it was a legitimate, government, law enforcement endeavor."

   Yet Trump, who is often quick to abandon even his most loyal allies
   when it becomes politically expedient, was notably supportive of
   Giuliani when asked about him during a meeting with Ukraine’s president
   on Wednesday. He even praised Giuliani’s recent appearances on
   television.

   Giuliani is known to provide Trump with informal political advice, and
   his assistance on an issue that could help the president politically
   has prompted speculation that he might be working for Trump’s
   re-election campaign. But a senior campaign official said Giuliani is
   not on the campaign’s payroll, and Federal Election Commission records
   do not show any payments by Trump’s campaign to Giuliani.
