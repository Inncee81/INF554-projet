   Book a table

Our concept

   In grec mythology it is said that Hebe, Zeus’s and Hera’s daughter, had
   for role to serve up the nectar to the gods. Today, HEBE, is mainly the
   story of the restaurant owner’s family opening a new table made to
   please all epicureans of the capital city.

   Ideally located in the historical heart of Paris and right next to
   Notre Dame church, Hebe is a restaurant of sharing and conviviality. An
   inventive cooking, delicate and seasonal recognized in the different
   meals to share. The whole being realized by the new talent of the
   culinary scene.

   Hébé’s setting is elegant with stylish and modern furniture. The warm
   colors and the dim lighting have been chosen to guarantee a cosy and
   relaxing atmosphere.

A chief’s cuisine

   Michel Portos, the two Michelin stars chef, creates Hébé’s menus by
   cherishing the exquisite French cuisine while combining Mediterranean
   flavors and aromas. The meals are audacious while staying simple and
   tasty.

   Each season, Michel renews his menu by elaborating recipes with south
   inspirations that resembles him. At our restaurant you will find modern
   and gourmet meals that mixes quality and freshness.

Mind your backs!

   In the kitchen, the chief Clement Courtemanche frees his imagination in
   order to propose original creations from fresh products. After a
   passage at Hubert Duchenne’s, it’s at Hebe that the young man uses his
   talent.
   Rigour et determination are that young prodigy’s assets and Clement
   let’s his creativity operate to realize unique plates.

   The duet of shock will make you discover astonishing associations that
   will make you want to discover the entire menu.

The Menu

In a cosy and warm atmosphere, The chef Michel Portos, two Michelin stars
chef and elected chef of the year in 2012 by the Gault&Millau guide, presents
an extensive menu that changes regularly according to season. We gathered
ourselves with Stephane Derenoncourt for the elaboration of our wines menu,
that you will be able to savour by glass or bottle.
