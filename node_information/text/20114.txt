   58 innocent people were killed in the Las Vegas shooting, and hundreds
   injured. How should you train your staff to protect themselves from
   violence while working a large-scale event?

Best Practices

Media and Entertainment Employers Must Train Staff to Handle Violent Attacks

   By Mark Lerner
   October 6th, 2017

   The mass shooting at the Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas was a
   devastating tragedy. Amidst the debates about gun control, terrorism,
   and the shooter’s motive, there is another unresolved issue:

Workplace safet

   In addition to dozens of bands and musical acts, the three-day country
   music concert was staffed by hundreds of employees: Live Nation
   organizers, event producers, production crew, instrument technicians,
   hair and makeup artists, ticket takers, merchandise vendors, security
   guards, bartenders and more.

   In the crowd, there were people working, too: music reviewers and
   journalists (including one from Rolling Stone), photographers,
   marketers and PR people.

   This isn’t the first time media and entertainment workers have been
   affected by mass violence in a performance venue. In the past few
   years, we’ve seen attacks at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, the Ariana
   Grande concert in Manchester, and a sports stadium and concert hall in
   Paris on November 15, 2015.

   Violence can happen in any workplace. According to OSHA, employees at
   particularly increased risk include healthcare and social service
   workers, retail workers, mail carriers and taxi drivers. But, they
   warn, “Workplace violence can strike anywhere, and no one is immune.”

   Major sports and entertainment venues are doing more than ever to stay
   safe. It’s commonplace to have metal detectors, advanced surveillance
   systems, on-site police and security teams, and restrictions on the
   type and amount of items patrons can bring inside.

   Yet, violence can still occur. In the case of the Las Vegas attack, the
   gunman never set foot on the festival grounds. He was able to shoot
   from his hotel window across the street—a scenario that concert
   organizers could have hardly anticipated.

How do media and entertainment employers protect their staff—at festivals,
concerts, conferences, or any other large-scale event?

   After the Manchester bombing, the UK’s Event Safety Alliance board
   member Tim Roberts released a document with counter-terrorism advice
   for concert crews. In the event of an attack, he suggests:

   “There is bound to be an element of chaos following any attack, people
   in the immediate vicinity will respond on reflex and the need for
   self-preservation. However, as soon as possible, we need to start
   taking control to protect life and safety.

   This means:
     * Establish a mechanism for Show-Stop (which should be part of your
       plan anyway for other types of incident)
     * Do what you can to support the venue with emergency messaging
     * Get to your place of safety
     * Await and respond to specific instruction from the police or the
       venue.”

   In an interview with Billboard magazine shortly after the Pulse
   nightclub shooting, public assembly safety and security consultant Russ
   Simons suggested an increased focus on employee training. “Everybody
   needs appropriate training, but more importantly, you can’t train them
   once and forget about it,” he told Billboard.

   “The key is to train people right, then observe them and assess their
   performance… That is where we fail more often than not. In my
   professional opinion, we don’t do we should do in making sure we are
   training and supporting our supervisors who are responsible for our
   line staff delivering consistent performance.”

   Chris Robinette, CEO of Prevent Advisors, told Variety magazine that
   employers need to ask themselves: “‘Is our staff prepared and trained
   for an active shooter? How do we evacuate? How do we provide immediate
   care? And have we rehearsed this with local law enforcement?’ No one is
   suggesting you can reduce these risks to zero, because you can’t. But
   you can mitigate them to the highest degree possible.”

   Does your team know what to do in case of a violent attack? What
   training do you provide in advance of large-scale workplace events such
   as festivals, concerts, conferences, panels or galas?

   There’s a strange dichotomy of time in the life of the average
   freelance writer. Your days operate around deadlines, so you rush to
   interview, rush to write, rush to finish and rush on to the next thing
   topping the perpetual to-do list. But when the work is done, there’s
   often a slow-as-molasses timeframe for payment to materialize.
   Somewhere in the universe, a check with your name on it awaits,
   unsigned and undeposited. When it will manifest is anyone’s guess.

   After writing for the same magazine for years, what happens when
   payment becomes sporadic and you take them to small claims court? I’ll
   tell you because it happened to me.

Just Happy to Be Working

   Early in my freelancing career, I was just a starry-eyed writer
   trudging into a thankless day job in the communications department of a
   nonprofit and gleefully plunking out magazine articles when I got home.
   I was doing what I loved, albeit on a part-time basis, and the paycheck
   made it all the more sweet.

   My bailiwick is women’s interests, particularly black women, but the
   pool of print pubs serving that market is awful small. Imagine my
   delight when an editor from one of the notables—you know, the ones that
   line the grocery store check-out—invited me to write a story. I can’t
   remember if my initial contact with her was a cordial pitch rejection
   or if she responded to a cold email I sent expressing interest in
   writing. But I do remember the subject line: “An Assignment for You.”

   It was a short, front-of-book news piece on the trending privatization
   of public institutions. According to her email and the contract that
   followed, I had a month to write the story and, as the legalese
   stipulated, I’d be paid 30 days after the issue hit newsstands. I
   nailed it. She gave me another assignment, this time a lead news
   feature about celebrity moms’ business ventures. I nailed that one,
   too.

   There was no indication in those initial months, then years, that I
   would eventually be plotting to Spiderman crawl up the walls of their
   corporate office building just to get my money. For a while, there was
   never a more contented girl who typed a byline. From then on, I was
   writing almost monthly, sometimes for multiple departments in one issue
   because she passed my name on to other editors. I covered news,
   spirituality and relationships, sometimes pitching, sometimes taking
   assignments. And, during the course of all these interactions, I built
   friendly working relationships.

Check Please. No, Seriously. Please?!

   Two or three years after I started freelancing for said publication, I
   was laid off from my day job and decided to try my hand at full-time
   freelancing. That feast-or-famine phase made me notice that I hadn’t
   seen a check from the mag in quite some time. I’d gotten caught up in
   the rhythm of submitting stories and wasn’t being attentive to my pay
   schedule. When I added up the balance, it came to almost $3,000.

   I emailed my editor to explain. “Oh my goodness,” she wrote back, “I’m
   so sorry! Send me all of the invoices and I’ll get them to accounting
   right away.” I was hopeful because the missing payments would’ve been
   enough to appease the bill collectors and maybe even pay a few things
   on time. With confidence in her promise to help, I continued to take
   assignments. But as more check-less time marched on, I prodded my
   editor for updates:

   “By the way, have you heard anything yet about the money?”

   “Hey, I’m just following up on those invoices. Any word?”

   Our messages over the course of the next few months proved we were
   equally bewildered. She couldn’t seem to make any headway as the
   go-between, so she gave me the email of the paycheck mistress at the
   corporate office. We’ll call her “Cathy.”

Going Corporate

   I peppered my initial email to our dear friend Cathy with gentle words,
   even a smiley face, because my goal wasn’t to piss her off or make her
   defensive. Despite their slow-to-pay tendencies, I didn’t want to burn
   the bridge. I emailed her once. Twice. Maybe about six or seven times
   over a month and a half. Finally, she responded. This is the only proof
   I got that she did in fact live and breathe:

   “Janelle,” she wrote. “Unfortunately, corporate is behind in cutting
   checks. I have sent your information and will send another email
   stating your inquiry of payments with hopes they will be able to give
   me a definite date as to when they will be cutting outstanding checks.
   I apologize for the delay, but please note that I do not handle cutting
   checks. I will inform you of their response as soon as I receive.”

   Translation: We’re late, but stop filling my inbox with your pestering
   because frankly, it’s really not my job to worry about your checks.

   In addition to emails, I called and left polite, then progressively
   less polite voicemails.

   “Hi Cathy! Just following up. Thank you!”

   By month two, my effervescence waned.

   “Cathy, this is Janelle. I still have not received any communication. I
   need to know where the payments stand.” No ‘thank you’ this go-round, I
   sniffed. That’ll show her.

   After two more months, without any response whatsoever, I let my
   irritation have its way.

   “Cathy, I have tried repeatedly to get in touch with you about money
   that is due to me for work I’ve already done. I’m sure you’re not in
   the business of working for free. Neither am I.”

   Finally after months of trying, when my editor reached out with an
   assignment for me, I had to turn it down.

Jackpot! I Can Finally Pay My Bills

   It’s a blessing to have virtual friendships with most, if not all, of
   my regular editors, and in a random conversation with one from another
   publication, I mentioned this particular magazine. Turns out we had
   both freelanced for them and she had a hard time wrangling her check
   from them, too. She’d taken them to small claims court.

   Now, aside from what I’d seen on episodes of Judge Judy, I knew zilch
   about this legal process. I wore Google out looking for information on
   how to do it. I learned where the magazine’s mystical corporate office
   was located and contacted the small claims division for that county. I
   needed to factor in not only court fees, but travel expenses in case I
   actually had to make the journey from my home in D.C. to the plaintiff
   in Atlanta, but my editor friend (or “frienditor” as I like to say)
   assured me that once she filed her case, they reached out to her
   immediately.

   She was right. The papers were filed in the morning and an attorney for
   the magazine called me by early afternoon. I’d since landed another day
   job, but I’d never given up on getting that money. I worked for it, I
   earned it and I was never, going to turn down a lump sum of three
   grand. After all of the time that had elapsed—by now, more than a year
   since I sent that initial email to my editor—it was just as much about
   the principle.

   After all of the time and energy it took to get to the point of signing
   my name on the back of that little watermarked piece of paper, I had my
   money the next day. The lawyer was very pleasant, very apologetic and
   very willing to cough up the money owed to make this nasty little
   incident go away. “I’m soooo sorry you had to experience this,” she
   gushed over the phone. “Please send me your address so we can overnight
   you a check. I’m also sending you a release form to sign, so please
   send that back to me, as well.” I appreciated her apology and the fact
   that she sounded genuinely horrified about my experience.

The Moral of the Story

   The fact that it took me the better part of a year to realize somebody
   in the world owed me almost $3,000 is my fault. I’ll admit it: I kept
   crappy books. My hatred of math and its companion evil, accounting,
   gave me cause to do bare-minimum bookkeeping. Typically, if numbers are
   involved, my eyes glaze over and my mind goes blank.

   Sticky notes were my spreadsheets and even those weren’t checked often.
   I signed contracts and tucked copies into a manila folder, so focused
   on the creative part of writing, which I love, that I neglected the
   administrative side of my business, which is necessary.

   I should’ve stopped writing for the mag much sooner than I did. My beef
   was with accounting, not my editors, but essentially working on a
   verbal promise to pay was a bad decision. Since this experience, if I’m
   owed more than one check, I wait until I get it before I even consider
   churning out so much as a headline.

   A lot of writers worry that legal action—even the threat of it—will
   make them seem difficult to work with, strain their relationships,
   perhaps get them blacklisted. I think, as long as you’re diplomatic and
   professional in your attempts (meaning not blasting them on Twitter) no
   other magazine would frown upon a writer actively pursuing what’s
   already due to them. If a publication doesn’t pay on time, it’s not a
   relationship worth holding on to anyway. And if another takes umbrage
   with a writer demanding their money, that’s not a relationship worth
   building in the first place.
