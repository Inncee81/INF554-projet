IMT labellised Carnot

Recognition of the excellence of our partner-oriented research

   The Carnot label seeks to shape and professionalize the partnerships
   between public research labs and socioeconomic stakeholders, primarily
   enterprises, in order to respond to their innovation needs.

   The Carnot system is centered around 4 fundamental principles:
     * Funds matching: Granted to accredited research structures, this is
       distinct from their annual budget allocation and is designed to
       incentivize Carnot Institutes to step up their partnership actions,
       in particular via contracts with SMEs;
     * Scientific resourcing: the funds matching system is intended to
       co-finance scientific resourcing programs, i.e. academic research
       projects designed to strengthen the institutes’ technological
       expertise and hence enable them to maintain or extend their
       scientific progress
     * The formation of a federative body through the Carnot Institutes
       Association.
     * Implementation of a quality procedure

The outstanding quality of the partnerships formed by the research labs of
IMT’s graduate schools has been rewarded by two Carnot Institute
accreditations

Carnot Télécom & Société Numérique (TSN)

   Holding a Carnot accreditation since 2006, the Télécom & Société
   Numérique Carnot Institute was the first Carnot Institute in
   “Information and Communication Technologies and Sciences” on a national
   level.

   With more than 1700 researchers, we focus on the technical, economic
   and social implications of the digital transition, most notably on the
   questions of smart objects, networks and media of the future, uses and
   services, autonomy and human health, the environment and security.

   Télécom & Société Numérique Carnot Institute is part of the Carnot
   Institutes Association.

Carnot M.I.N.E.S

   M.I.N.E.S Carnot Institute combines the forces of six Mines schools
   under the aegis of the Ministry for Industry, along with 3 research
   laboratories of the École polytechnique and ENSTA ParisTech. These
   structures, of which many are CNRS joint research labs, are supported
   by the Armines Association in their contract research work.

   With 2000 researchers, the Institute is a major player in partner-based
   research in France. It aims to stimulate value creation among its
   economic partners and trigger the innovation chain, starting with the
   work of its research laboratories.

   Conducted jointly with businesses as part of its “research in
   partnership” model, the research by Carnot M.I.N.E.S targets markets
   with a high growth potential.

Armines

The Armines association manages the Mines schools’ contract research

   The Armines association manages the Mines schools’ contract research
   and contributes to this research with its own (human and material)
   means in the schools’ laboratories, financed by contract resources.

   The Armines-School model has allowed research centers that it shares
   with the partner schools to take on an original and unique identity in
   France (47.2 million Euros’ worth of resources from research contracts
   in 2012), based on a form of research in which the scientific approach
   is permanently confronted with industrial, economic and societal
   issues.

   Such is the level of commitment that the research centers have become
   genuine “academic enterprises” which operate using their own resources
   within the framework of Armines.

   Today, after over 45 years in an ever-changing environment, Armines is
   working with schools and research centers to anticipate the development
   of future partner-based research, research which will require both a
   high level of scientific creativity and results that must be ever more
   rapidly achieved and directly usable by economic players.
