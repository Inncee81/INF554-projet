       Size Really Does Matter Size Really Does Matter
   The Nanotechnology Revolution
   by Colm Durkan

   "The text is lightly written but, underneath the entertaining gloss of
   anecdote and personal detail, this is actually an intensely serious and
   carefully constructed book, aimed at informing the educated public
   about science in general and nanotechnology in particular. It is
   attractively produced, with innumerable well-captioned coloured images
   ... To my mind, Colm Durkan has succeeded in combining the accessible
   style of the best science journalists with the authority and vision
   that come from being a successful scientist and an expert in his
   field."

                                                      Contemporary Physics

       How to Measure the Infinite How to Measure the Infinite
   Mathematics with Infinite and Infinitesimal Numbers
   by Vieri Benci & Mauro Di Nasso

   "This text shows that the study of the almost-forgotten,
   non-Archimedean mathematics deserves to be utilized more intently in a
   variety of fields within the larger domain of applied mathematics."

                                                                    CHOICE
