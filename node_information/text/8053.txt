Beyond Meat’s burger could pose health risks to people with peanut allergies
— even though it doesn’t contain peanuts

   The Beyond Burger is made of plants and contains no animal products,
   but it does contain pea-protein isolate.

   Beyond Meat, the maker of the Beyond Burger BYND, -3.27%  the
   plant-based meat substitute that looks and tastes like beef that’s sold
   at Whole Foods AMZN, +1.53%   and restaurant chains like TGI Friday’s
   and Carl’s Jr., doesn’t contain any peanuts.

   But people with food allergies should proceed with care, according to
   Utah-based Nadia Pflaum, an investigative producer with KUTV 2News in
   Salt Lake City. Pflaum said she had to take Benadryl after eating a
   Beyond Burger she purchased at Carl’s Jr. in Salt Lake City.

     ‘We added cautionary language to both our packaging and website.’

   The ingredient, pea-protein isolate, and some restaurants fail to give
   allergy warnings, she said. Pflaum said she’s allergic to peanuts, but
   has never had an issue with peas and didn’t see any warning signs at
   the restaurant, despite advertisements for the burger.

   “Beyond Meat was advertised all over: Outside on the windows, inside on
   the walls, on place mats, placards and even on the cashiers’ shirts.
   But nowhere did we see any print, fine or otherwise, that offered any
   allergy warnings,” KUTV 2News reported.

   Beyond Meat and Carl’s Jr. did not immediately return requests for
   comment, but Beyond Meat told KUTV 2News that its products are labeled
   in compliance with legal requirements, and that the warning about the
   presence of peas in its meatless burgers is not required by law.

   “We added cautionary language to both our packaging and website,” a
   spokesperson told the media outlet. “This language appears immediately
   below the ingredient list, where consumers would typically look to find
   allergen information on a food package — it is where the FDA-required
   ‘CONTAINS’ statement for major food allergens would normally appear.”

   Don’t miss: Are you ready to move beyond chicken and beef? Try ‘tasty’
   locust ice cream and maggot sausages instead

   Pflaum says she experienced wheezing and itching, the same reaction she
   gets if she accidentally eats a peanut. Beyond Meat labels have a star
   next to the ingredient “Pea protein isolate” with fine print that
   reads: “People with severe allergies to legumes like peanuts should be
   cautious when introducing pea protein into their diet because of the
   possibility of a pea allergy.”

     Meat-substitutes with pea-protein isolate are highly concentrated
     and potent.

     —Sharon Zarabi, a registered dietitian and nutritionist at Lenox
     Hill Hospital

   “Only about 5% of people with peanut allergies have a problem with
   other beans. When they do, those beans can include peas, and having a
   product that has pea protein might increase their chances of having a
   problem,” Dr. Scott Sicherer, director of the Jaffe Food Allergy
   Institute at Mount Sinai, told MarketWatch.

   Meat-substitute products that contain pea-protein isolate are highly
   concentrated and potent, and, therefore, may trigger allergic reactions
   even in people who have never had problems eating peas. “That could be
   why the intolerances are happening,” Sharon Zarabi, a registered
   dietitian and nutritionist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City
   says.

   The National Restaurant Association urges consumers to tell
   food-service employees about their allergies. “Any individual that has
   a food allergy needs to let their server know to see if the
   establishment can accommodate their needs,” William Weichelt, director
   of food safety and industry relations for the National Restaurant
   Association, told MarketWatch in an email.

   “If a food service establishment wants to serve those with food
   allergies, it needs to be prepared to work with customers to help make
   them feel comfortable with their selection and that includes knowing
   what allergens are in the food they prepare,” he added.

   Beyond Meat, hot off a soaring IPO, raised at least $240 million at a
   valuation just shy of $1.5 billion, suggesting that the alternative
   meat market could have a long-term future. The plant-based or lab-grown
   meat market could surge to $140 billion over the next decade as new
   companies make up a 10% share of the $1.4 trillion meat market,
   Barclays said.

Beyond Meat’s burger could pose health risks to people with peanut allergies —
                    even though it doesn’t contain peanuts

   By Jeanette Settembre

   Published: Jun 10, 2019 6:01 am ET

Restaurants including TGI Friday’s, Carl’s Jr. and supermarket chain Whole Foods
serve the Beyond Burger

   The Beyond Burger is made of plants and contains no animal products,
   but it does contain pea-protein isolate.

   Beyond Meat, the maker of the Beyond Burger BYND-3.27%  the plant-based
   meat substitute that looks and tastes like beef that’s sold at Whole
   Foods AMZN+1.53%   and restaurant chains like TGI Friday’s and Carl’s
   Jr., doesn’t contain any peanuts.

   But people with food allergies should proceed with care, according to
   Utah-based Nadia Pflaum, an investigative producer with KUTV 2News in
   Salt Lake City. Pflaum said she had to take Benadryl after eating a
   Beyond Burger she purchased at Carl’s Jr. in Salt Lake City.

     ‘We added cautionary language to both our packaging and website.’

   —Statement by Beyond Meat

   The ingredient, pea-protein isolate, and some restaurants fail to give
   allergy warnings, she said. Pflaum said she’s allergic to peanuts, but
   has never had an issue with peas and didn’t see any warning signs at
   the restaurant, despite advertisements for the burger.

   “Beyond Meat was advertised all over: Outside on the windows, inside on
   the walls, on place mats, placards and even on the cashiers’ shirts.
   But nowhere did we see any print, fine or otherwise, that offered any
   allergy warnings,” KUTV 2News reported.

   Beyond Meat and Carl’s Jr. did not immediately return requests for
   comment, but Beyond Meat told KUTV 2News that its products are labeled
   in compliance with legal requirements, and that the warning about the
   presence of peas in its meatless burgers is not required by law.

   “We added cautionary language to both our packaging and website,” a
   spokesperson told the media outlet. “This language appears immediately
   below the ingredient list, where consumers would typically look to find
   allergen information on a food package — it is where the FDA-required
   ‘CONTAINS’ statement for major food allergens would normally appear.”

   Don’t miss: Are you ready to move beyond chicken and beef? Try ‘tasty’
   locust ice cream and maggot sausages instead

   Pflaum says she experienced wheezing and itching, the same reaction she
   gets if she accidentally eats a peanut. Beyond Meat labels have a star
   next to the ingredient “Pea protein isolate” with fine print that
   reads: “People with severe allergies to legumes like peanuts should be
   cautious when introducing pea protein into their diet because of the
   possibility of a pea allergy.”

     Meat-substitutes with pea-protein isolate are highly concentrated
     and potent.

   —Sharon Zarabi, a registered dietitian and nutritionist at Lenox Hill
   Hospital

   “Only about 5% of people with peanut allergies have a problem with
   other beans. When they do, those beans can include peas, and having a
   product that has pea protein might increase their chances of having a
   problem,” Dr. Scott Sicherer, director of the Jaffe Food Allergy
   Institute at Mount Sinai, told MarketWatch.

   Meat-substitute products that contain pea-protein isolate are highly
   concentrated and potent, and, therefore, may trigger allergic reactions
   even in people who have never had problems eating peas. “That could be
   why the intolerances are happening,” Sharon Zarabi, a registered
   dietitian and nutritionist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City
   says.

   The National Restaurant Association urges consumers to tell
   food-service employees about their allergies. “Any individual that has
   a food allergy needs to let their server know to see if the
   establishment can accommodate their needs,” William Weichelt, director
   of food safety and industry relations for the National Restaurant
   Association, told MarketWatch in an email.

   “If a food service establishment wants to serve those with food
   allergies, it needs to be prepared to work with customers to help make
   them feel comfortable with their selection and that includes knowing
   what allergens are in the food they prepare,” he added.

   Beyond Meat, hot off a soaring IPO, raised at least $240 million at a
   valuation just shy of $1.5 billion, suggesting that the alternative
   meat market could have a long-term future. The plant-based or lab-grown
   meat market could surge to $140 billion over the next decade as new
   companies make up a 10% share of the $1.4 trillion meat market,
   Barclays said.

   dietitian and nutritionist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City
   says.

   The National Restaurant Association urges consumers to tell
   food-service employees about their allergies. “Any individual that has
   a food allergy needs to let their server know to see if the
   establishment can accommodate their needs,” William Weichelt, director
   of food safety and industry relations for the National Restaurant
   Association, told MarketWatch in an email.

   “If a food service establishment wants to serve those with food
   allergies, it needs to be prepared to work with customers to help make
   them feel comfortable with their selection and that includes knowing
   what allergens are in the food they prepare,” he added.

   Beyond Meat, hot off a soaring IPO, raised at least $240 million at a
   valuation just shy of $1.5 billion, suggesting that the alternative
   meat market could have a long-term future. The plant-based or lab-grown
   meat market could surge to $140 billion over the next decade as new
   companies make up a 10% share of the $1.4 trillion meat market,
   Barclays said.

Beyond Meat’s burger could pose health risks to people with peanut allergies —
                    even though it doesn’t contain peanuts

   By Jeanette Settembre

   Published: Jun 10, 2019 6:01 am ET

Restaurants including TGI Friday’s, Carl’s Jr. and supermarket chain Whole Foods
serve the Beyond Burger

   The Beyond Burger is made of plants and contains no animal products,
   but it does contain pea-protein isolate.

   Beyond Meat, the maker of the Beyond Burger BYND-3.27%  the plant-based
   meat substitute that looks and tastes like beef that’s sold at Whole
   Foods AMZN+1.53%   and restaurant chains like TGI Friday’s and Carl’s
   Jr., doesn’t contain any peanuts.

   But people with food allergies should proceed with care, according to
   Utah-based Nadia Pflaum, an investigative producer with KUTV 2News in
   Salt Lake City. Pflaum said she had to take Benadryl after eating a
   Beyond Burger she purchased at Carl’s Jr. in Salt Lake City.

     ‘We added cautionary language to both our packaging and website.’

   —Statement by Beyond Meat

   The ingredient, pea-protein isolate, and some restaurants fail to give
   allergy warnings, she said. Pflaum said she’s allergic to peanuts, but
   has never had an issue with peas and didn’t see any warning signs at
   the restaurant, despite advertisements for the burger.

   “Beyond Meat was advertised all over: Outside on the windows, inside on
   the walls, on place mats, placards and even on the cashiers’ shirts.
   But nowhere did we see any print, fine or otherwise, that offered any
   allergy warnings,” KUTV 2News reported.

   Beyond Meat and Carl’s Jr. did not immediately return requests for
   comment, but Beyond Meat told KUTV 2News that its products are labeled
   in compliance with legal requirements, and that the warning about the
   presence of peas in its meatless burgers is not required by law.

   “We added cautionary language to both our packaging and website,” a
   spokesperson told the media outlet. “This language appears immediately
   below the ingredient list, where consumers would typically look to find
   allergen information on a food package — it is where the FDA-required
   ‘CONTAINS’ statement for major food allergens would normally appear.”

   locust ice cream and maggot sausages instead

   Pflaum says she experienced wheezing and itching, the same reaction she
   gets if she accidentally eats a peanut. Beyond Meat labels have a star
   next to the ingredient “Pea protein isolate” with fine print that
   reads: “People with severe allergies to legumes like peanuts should be
   cautious when introducing pea protein into their diet because of the
   possibility of a pea allergy.”

     Meat-substitutes with pea-protein isolate are highly concentrated
     and potent.

   —Sharon Zarabi, a registered dietitian and nutritionist at Lenox Hill
   Hospital

   “Only about 5% of people with peanut allergies have a problem with
   other beans. When they do, those beans can include peas, and having a
   product that has pea protein might increase their chances of having a
   problem,” Dr. Scott Sicherer, director of the Jaffe Food Allergy
   Institute at Mount Sinai, told MarketWatch.

   Meat-substitute products that contain pea-protein isolate are highly
   concentrated and potent, and, therefore, may trigger allergic reactions
   even in people who have never had problems eating peas. “That could be
   why the intolerances are happening,” Sharon Zarabi, a registered
   dietitian and nutritionist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City
   says.

   The National Restaurant Association urges consumers to tell
   food-service employees about their allergies. “Any individual that has
   a food allergy needs to let their server know to see if the
   establishment can accommodate their needs,” William Weichelt, director
   of food safety and industry relations for the National Restaurant
   Association, told MarketWatch in an email.

   “If a food service establishment wants to serve those with food
   allergies, it needs to be prepared to work with customers to help make
   them feel comfortable with their selection and that includes knowing
   what allergens are in the food they prepare,” he added.

   Beyond Meat, hot off a soaring IPO, raised at least $240 million at a
   valuation just shy of $1.5 billion, suggesting that the alternative
   meat market could have a long-term future. The plant-based or lab-grown
   meat market could surge to $140 billion over the next decade as new
   companies make up a 10% share of the $1.4 trillion meat market,
   Barclays said.
