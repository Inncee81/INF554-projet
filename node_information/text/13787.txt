Abstract

   :
   The majority of residents in low- and middle-income countries are
   served by onsite sanitation. Equitable access to sanitation, including
   emptying, collection, and transport services for the accumulation of
   faecal sludge remains a major challenge. Comprehensive information on
   service coverage by mechanical faecal sludge emptying service providers
   is lacking. The purpose of this study is to analyse the spatial
   distribution of service coverage and identify areas without faecal
   sludge emptying services in Kampala, Uganda. The study uses GIS
   (geographic information systems) as a tool to analyse real-time data of
   service providers based on GPS (global positioning system) units that
   were installed in a representative number of trucks. Of the total
   recorded 5653 emptying events, 27% were located outside Kampala city
   boundaries. Of those within Kampala city boundaries, 37% were
   classified as non-household customers. Areas without service provision
   accounted for 13% of the total area. Service provision normalised by
   population density revealed much greater service provision in medium-
   and high-income areas than low- and very low-income areas. The employed
   method provides a powerful tool to optimise faecal sludge management on
   a city-wide scale by increasing sustainability of the planning and
   decision-making process, increasing access to service provision and
   reducing faecal sludge transport times and costs.

1. Introduction

   Globally, 2.7 billion people rely on on-site sanitation with
   containment technologies, such as septic tanks and pit latrines [1]. In
   urban areas of Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, 65%–100% of the population
   is served by these technologies [1,2]. On-site sanitation can provide a
   sustainable and more affordable option to sewer-based sanitation,
   either as a standalone solution or in combination [3,4]. However,
   currently, there is a lack of sustainable management of faecal sludge,
   the material that accumulates in containment technologies. If faecal
   sludge is not emptied, collected, and delivered to appropriate
   treatment, there are serious impacts to public and environmental
   health. Emptying, collection and transport services are the critical
   link in city-wide faecal sludge management, from household-level users,
   to treatment for resource recovery and safe end-use or disposal [2,5].
   Providing sanitation is a public good and the responsibility of public
   authorities. Yet, private service providers also play a key role in
   faecal sludge management. Hence, cooperative public‑private
   partnerships are essential [6]. Faecal sludge is emptied manually or
   mechanically, both with distinct advantages and disadvantages [7,8].
   Manual service providers fulfil a crucial need in densely populated,
   low-income urban settlements (“slums”) with narrow roads or paths that
   are not accessible to trucks [9]. However, manual service provision is
   often informal and unhygienic. Additionally, this faecal sludge
   typically does not get transported to treatment but directly dumped in
   the surrounding environment, as appropriate solutions are lacking
   [10,11,12]. Mechanical emptying services are provided by motorised
   trucks with vacuum pumps. This is currently the most advanced
   technology for faecal sludge emptying, collection, and transport, based
   on efficiency and limited human contact with faecal matter. However,
   these services are costly. For example, in Kampala, fuel costs make up
   25% to 35% of the cost for emptying and transport [12]. A method to
   optimise logistics of city-wide emptying services could greatly reduce
   these costs.
   The use of logistical tools and information communications technology
   to analyse emptying services in low- and middle-income countries is
   limited. However, previous studies in the field of solid waste
   management have used spatial data imbedded in geographic information
   systems (GIS) for evaluating, visualising, and optimising the logistics
   of waste collection systems [13,14]. In the context of faecal sludge
   management, Kennedy-Walker et al. [15] implemented a model-based
   approach to reduce transport time of faecal sludge. Using the potential
   of available technologies and tools for analysis of transport routes
   between the location of faecal sludge emptying and discharge locations
   would allow for optimisation of many aspects of faecal sludge
   management.
   The objectives of this study were to use GPS (global positioning
   system) and GIS tools to identify the scale of operation of mechanical
   faecal sludge emptying services, and to evaluate ways to optimise
   faecal sludge logistics at a city-wide scale to increase access to
   equitable sanitation services. These innovative methodologies and tools
   for the analyses of faecal sludge management were found to be effective
   for this purpose.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Context Area

   This research was conducted in Kampala, the capital of Uganda. Kampala
   has a total area of 178 km^2 at an altitude of 1140 m, and a tropical
   climate with two rainy seasons. The city is divided into five municipal
   divisions (Central, Makindye, Rubaga, Kawempe, Nakawa), which are
   further divided into 99 parishes. Of the total city area, 64% is
   classified as residential with about 1.5 million inhabitants [16]. The
   population doubles during the day, as many people commute into the city
   [17]. Approximately 60% of the city residents live in informal
   low-income settlements, which cover 10.8% of the total city area
   [18,19]. Of the Kampala residents, 92.5% are served by on-site
   sanitation (projected for 2013), with pit latrines being the most
   prevalent containment technology (36.9%), followed by septic tanks
   (27.6%), ventilated improved pit latrines (26.1%), raised pit latrines
   (5.4%), public toilets (2.8%), and other (1.2%), including open
   defecation and bucket latrines [20].
   Faecal sludge in Kampala can only be legally discharged for treatment
   at two locations, the Bugolobi wastewater treatment plant or the Lubigi
   faecal sludge and wastewater treatment plant, both operated by the
   National Water and Sewerage Corporation (NWSC). Mechanical emptying
   service providers (vacuum trucks) and formal businesses operating with
   semi-mechanised emptying technologies (e.g., the Gulper—a direct lift
   pump that can be operated by a team of 2–3 people), discharge faecal
   sludge at either of these locations. Illegal dumping by these
   businesses has not been observed. However, it is known that within the
   informal sector (manual emptying), faecal sludge is dumped directly
   into the environment, along with pit latrines that are broken open at
   the bottom and directly drain into the environment [21]. Lubigi faecal
   sludge and wastewater treatment plant started operating in 2014, and
   was already at design capacity of 400 m^3 faecal sludge per day within
   the first months. The process flow includes settling/thickening tanks,
   followed by co-treatment of the supernatant with wastewater in
   stabilisation ponds, and drying beds for the solids. Bugolobi
   wastewater treatment plant has a design capacity of 32,000 m^3 of
   wastewater per day, and was not designed for the additional loading of
   faecal sludge [22]. However, since there are no other options
   available, discharge of faecal sludge at Bugolobi is allowed and
   constitutes around 200 m^3 per day to the influent. Hence, Bugolobi is
   not operating as designed or meeting effluent regulations due to solids
   overloading and technical difficulties. The treatment flow at Bugolobi
   consists of settling tanks with supernatant going to trickling filters,
   solids going to digesters (if operational) followed by drying beds.
   Overall, around 59% of excreta that is managed as faecal sludge is
   safely managed, for more detailed information, please refer to
   Schoebitz et al. [23].

2.2. Research Implementation

   The data collection took place between March and July 2015. A
   literature study and field observations were carried out to obtain an
   overview of the urban sanitation system and key stakeholders. A
   stakeholder analysis was conducted to assess the organisational
   structure, mode of operation, and responsibilities of faecal sludge
   emptying services. Collaborative working relationships were established
   to ensure transparent communication of the aims and objectives of the
   study, and to obtain permission of participants. Operating trucks,
   names of drivers, truck volume, working procedures, ownership, and
   association membership were recorded.

2.3. Data Collection

   Trucks of mechanical emptying service providers participating in the
   study were equipped with a GPS data logger GT-730FL-S (CanMore
   Electronics Co.; Zhubei, Taiwan). This data logger was connected to an
   XTPower MP 10400 powerbank (Model PB-AS025) (DBK Electronics Co.;
   Shenzhen, China), which served as an external battery to allow
   continuous recording for approximately 7.5 days. The data logger was
   configured to create a waypoint every ten seconds. Data loggers and
   batteries were stored in closable plastic containers, packed with paper
   to prevent moisture accumulation and to provide a buffer to external
   influences. The container was placed behind the driver’s seat and
   exchanged on a weekly basis. Battery exchange and data export were
   performed at the treatment plants during faecal sludge discharge or
   while the truck was waiting there for customers. To support this task,
   an employee of the association was appointed and remunerated.

2.4. Data Interpretation

   CanWay software (CanWay, version 1.1.12; (CanMore Electronics Co.;
   Zhubei, Taiwan, 2016) was used to export recorded waypoints from the
   data loggers and GPS data were analysed with ArcGIS (ArcGIS, version
   10.2.2; Esri: Redlands, CA, USA, 2013). For the identification of
   faecal sludge emptying events, Python scripts were developed. The
   travel velocity was calculated by dividing time and distance between
   two waypoints. Prior to implementation of the study, field testing was
   conducted to evaluate the potential for kinematic errors. Emptying
   events were simulated by stopping the truck. While stopped, errors
   showing movement of 1–3 km/h were occasionally observed. To account for
   this error, trucks were only recorded as moving if their velocity was
   greater than 4 km/h. For trucks belonging to either the Private
   Emptiers Association (PEA) or the Kampala Private Emptiers Association
   (KPEA), an emptying event was defined as a period of more than 15 min
   without movement. For trucks belonging to the Kampala Capital City
   Authority (KCCA) this period was reduced to 10 min, as it was observed
   that KCCA trucks required less time for the process of emptying the
   containment. In addition, the following events were filtered out from
   the analyses:
     * Any event between 7 p.m. and 6 a.m., when the treatment plants are
       not open for discharge.
     * Any events longer than three hours, which were considered as
       waiting time.
     * Any events recorded at the treatment plant that were considered as
       discharge of faecal sludge or waiting time.

   To cross-check validity of the recorded emptying events, the total
   number was compared with obtained NWSC records from the treatment
   plants, where each discharge event is documented. In addition, factors
   that might affect the scale of emptying services were evaluated to
   determine the representativeness of the selected research period,
   including monthly precipitation (e.g., containment technologies fill up
   faster), increased income during crop harvest periods (e.g., increased
   income), and timing of school fees and public holidays (e.g.,
   decreasing emptying service requests due to extra expenditures).
   All identified emptying events that were recorded during the period of
   this research are provided as supplemental material to this paper,
   including year, month, day, and time, as well as the x- and
   y-coordinates of the event.

2.5. Data Analyses

   The following steps were performed to identify and interpret the scale
   of operation of mechanical faecal sludge emptying services:
     * GIS analyses of the spatial distribution of emptying events inside
       the boundaries of Kampala and the Greater Kampala Metropolitan
       Area, and outside the Greater Kampala Metropolitan Area.
     * GIS analyses of service coverage in low-income informal settlements
       with KCCA statistics [24]. A 100 m buffer was added to the
       perimeter of the designated boundaries of informal settlements to
       account for their informal nature, which means they do not have
       precise boundaries and are difficult to map, show an uncontrolled
       sprawl, and experience rapid growth [25].
     * Identification of high-frequency emptying services. Locations with
       more than six recorded emptying events during the research period
       (i.e., more than two emptying events per month) where defined as
       such, indicating a non-household origin of faecal sludge.
     * Identification of areas without service provision during the study
       period. For analysis, a 0.5 × 0.5 km grid that divides the area of
       Kampala into 809 cells, each of 0.25 km^2, was projected over the
       city map. A cell was defined as an area without service provision
       if no emptying event took place during the three month research
       period. This grid was, furthermore, applied to classify these areas
       into areas with and without residents.
     * To analyse the scale of service provision on the parish level, the
       emptying frequency was calculated (Equation 1). Population and area
       are based on data obtained from Fichtner Water and Transportation
       [20].

   Areas with no residents, and previously identified locations with
   frequent emptying events, were excluded to ensure that the analyses
   were based only on household-level emptying services. R open-source
   software (R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing,
   version 3.3.2; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria,
   2016) was used for analyses [26].
   To evaluate how GIS analyses could contribute to optimisation of faecal
   sludge emptying, collection and transport logistics in Kampala, a
   location-allocation analysis was performed. For this analysis, the road
   network was used to identify the shortest travel distances between the
   currently operating treatment plants and the recorded emptying events.
   Distances between the treatment plants and emptying events where then
   compared with linear distances between emptying events and future
   treatment plants in Kinawataka and Nalukolongo. These treatment plants
   are currently planned under the Kampala Sanitation Program and will
   provide two additional discharge locations for emptying service
   providers [20].

3. Results and Discussion

3.1. Overview of Service Providers

   In total, 63 private faecal sludge emptying, collection and transport
   trucks are operating in Kampala, of which 25 are members of the PEA, 37
   of the KPEA, and one remains independent. KCCA, the public service
   provider, had four trucks in operation during the research period.
   These primarily operated within the public sector (e.g., schools,
   markets, public, and communal toilets). Emptying services in
   institutional, industrial, and commercial areas are performed by both
   private and public service providers [12].
   Depending on the truck volume, the trucks are operated by one driver
   and one to two assistants. Faecal sludge is transported either to
   Lubigi or Bugolobi treatment plants for discharge. At the time of the
   research, the discharge fee was USD 2.0–5.6, depending on the truck
   volume. In between service calls, while trucks are waiting, they are
   based at either of the treatment plants (23 at Bugolobi, 44 at Lubigi).
   Private service providers wait at the respective treatment plant for
   customer calls, whereas KCCA operates continuously with a defined list
   of customers to be serviced daily. Manual faecal sludge emptying
   services are available, however, data on the scale of operation is
   lacking [12].
   Private service providers are directly contacted by the customer and
   the fee for emptying services ranges from USD 17–28 per trip, depending
   on factors such as distance, truck volume, presence of solid waste in
   the containment, and density of sludge [12]. The existing truck volumes
   are: 2–3.9 m^3 (23 trucks), 4–5.9 m^3 (28 trucks), 6–7.9 m^3 (3
   trucks), and 8–11 m^3 (13 trucks).
   Private service providers report that factors such as timing of heavy
   rain, monthly pay day, harvest period, due date of school fees, and
   public holidays influence the frequency of emptying requests. However,
   based on NWSC records during the period of this study, none of these
   factors showed an indicative influence. It is possible that they do
   have an effect though, as these factors mainly affect households. In
   previous studies, up to 50% of faecal sludge discharged at treatment is
   from non-household sources, and so these types of household level
   influences may not be observable [23].

3.2. Scale of Operation

   In total, 34 out of 67 trucks operating at the time were equipped with
   GPS data loggers. KCCA trucks were equipped for a five week period,
   with all other trucks were equipped for twelve weeks. During the
   research period, 5’653 emptying events were recorded. The data were
   assumed to be representative of the patterns of service delivery for
   all trucks in the city, as 51% of all trucks that were monitored
   included representative numbers from a range of factors, which could
   affect the spatial distribution of emptying events. This included 56%
   of the trucks based at Bugolobi and 48% based at Lubigi, 64% of trucks
   belonging to the PEA and 38% belonging to the KPEA, and a range of
   operating truck volumes including 56% of 2–3.9 m^3 trucks, 46% of 4–5.9
   m^3 trucks, 100% of 6–7.9 m^3 trucks, and 38% of 8–11 m^3 trucks.
   Additionally, in comparison to NWSC records of discharge events at
   treatment, this study captured 65% of emptying services provided by
   private service providers and 112% by KCCA. Private service providers
   performed an average of 2.1 emptying events per truck per day, whereas
   KCCA trucks performed 5.8 events per truck per day. Reasons for this
   significant difference appear not to be that KCCA is more efficient in
   emptying, but in scheduling emptying events, as drivers are provided
   with a daily schedule and are providing services to containment
   technologies that are readily accessible. This indicates that private
   service providers could also potentially operate at increased capacity
   with more effective planning of emptying schedules, such as proposed
   call centres [27], which could also contribute to an increase in
   overall service delivery.

3.2.1. Spatial Distribution of Emptying Events

   An overview of all recorded emptying events, of which 73% were located
   within Kampala boundaries, 22% in the Greater Kampala Metropolitan
   Area, and 5% outside the Greater Kampala Metropolitan Area is provided
   in Figure 1 (for supplemental report with additional maps available,
   see [28]). Collected faecal sludge is most frequently transported to
   the closest treatment plant to the emptying location. Due to
   urbanisation, population growth and limited unoccupied areas within
   Kampala boundaries, it can be expected that demand for faecal sludge
   emptying services outside Kampala, but within the Greater Kampala
   Metropolitan Area, will continue to increase within the near future.
   This demonstrates the importance of thinking outside of political
   boundaries when planning for faecal sludge management infrastructure
   and emptying service delivery.

3.2.2. Service Coverage in Low-Income Informal Settlements

   As illustrated in Figure 2, 37% of all recorded emptying events were
   located within informal settlements. However, when considering this
   high frequency of emptying events population density should also be
   considered, and it should not be confused with adequate access to
   improved sanitation [29], as 68% of residents of informal settlements
   in Kampala share toilet facilities with an average of 82 users [18].
   The high frequency of emptying events are, therefore, explained by an
   inadequate number of toilet facilities per capita, resulting in overuse
   and rapid filling of containment technologies. The increased population
   density in informal settlements is also a factor for increased demand
   for emptying services, which is not fully captured in these numbers as
   manual emptying is also taking place where access to trucks is not
   feasible. Service provision in these areas could potentially be
   improved by linking manual and mechanical service provision with
   transfer stations.
   Information on volumes and filling rates of containment technologies in
   Kampala is, for the most part, not available [30]. Customers frequently
   do not know volumes of their faecal sludge containment and service
   providers have to estimate based on qualitative assumptions [12]. This
   illustrates the future need for more in-depth quantification and
   characterisation studies for the appropriate planning of faecal sludge
   management and sizing of treatment facilities.

3.2.3. High-Frequency Non-Household Emptying Services

   Of the 1525 (or 37%) recorded emptying events 98 were from customers
   with high-frequency emptying services. These locations were
   non-household sources (e.g., commercial establishments, workers in
   industries, public toilets), which have faecal sludge emptied much more
   frequently than household-level users. It is imperative to consider
   non-household faecal sludge quantities, as Kampala doubles in size
   during the day with people commuting into the city [17]. It can be
   expected that faecal sludge from non-household sources has different
   physico-chemical characteristics due to shorter retention times and
   different inputs to the containment (e.g., kitchen, bathing), which
   highlights the importance of carrying out quantification and
   characterisation on a scale that is relevant to planned infrastructure
   (e.g., city-wide or neighbourhood scale). Faecal sludge is highly
   variable due to factors that range widely at the household level, such
   as soil characteristics, ground water, system inputs, quality of
   construction, type of containment, and it is also not homogenised
   during transport in the sewer as is wastewater [4]. Not taking this
   into account can lead to inappropriate designs and management plans;
   for example, using literature values instead of actual local
   characteristics led to over-design of a treatment plant by 200% over
   capacity [31]. Accurate designs are important to ensure appropriate
   treatment performance, not waste financial resources, which, among
   other factors, contribute to sustainable long-term operation of faecal
   sludge treatment plants [32].

3.2.4. Areas without Service Provision

   As presented in Figure 3, 54.7 km^2, or 31%, of the Kampala area did
   not receive any service provision during this study. To evaluate
   service provision, areas within Central Division that are connected to
   the sewer and non-residential areas were removed, resulting in a total
   adjusted area of 23.6 km^2, or 13%. Obviously, it cannot be
   extrapolated that emptying could never occur in these areas. However,
   identification of urban areas without mechanical emptying service
   provision over a three month period is valuable for a service delivery
   assessment, to identify areas for priority interventions by the
   municipality, and to identify untapped markets that the private sector
   could fill. Parts of informal settlements that were difficult to access
   could be accessed with manual emptiers using semi-mechanised equipment
   (e.g., the Gulper), and mechanical service provision elsewhere [21].

3.2.5. Influence of Population Density on Frequency of Emptying

   Hypothetically, income, type of containment technology, and population
   density could be indicators for levels of service provision. For
   example, in low-income areas, residents are less able to afford
   emptying services, and/or locations are not accessible for trucks
   [7,21]. In areas where unlined pit latrines are the prevailing type of
   containment technology, faecal sludge is typically not serviced by
   mechanical emptying with trucks due to the risk of collapse during
   emptying [20,33]. In Kampala, population density is also an indicator
   of income level and containment technology. To further evaluate service
   provision at the household level in Kampala, the frequency of emptying
   events during this study was normalised to land area and 1000
   population equivalents on a parish level (Equation (1); data for
   analyses in supplementary material, 1000 was selected for ease of
   analysis) as defined by the following four levels of service delivery:
     * Low frequency: Emptying events > 0 < 50/1000 cap × ha
     * Medium frequency: Emptying events ≥ 50 < 200/1000 cap × ha
     * High frequency: Emptying events ≥ 200 < 500/1000 cap × ha
     * Very high frequency: Emptying events ≥ 500/1000 cap × ha

   As shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5, adjusting emptying events for
   population density reveals that areas that have the highest levels of
   service provision were in medium- and high-income areas (Figure 6) and
   these areas also have lower resident population densities. Parishes
   with the lowest levels of service provision were in low- and very
   low-income areas and have higher resident population densities. Even
   though 37% of all emptying events inside the Kampala boundaries were
   recorded in informal settlements, 32% of those were non-household
   sources of faecal sludge that were not included in this analysis. Based
   on this analysis, it appears that household-level users in informal
   settlements are greatly underserved by toilet facilities and also
   mechanical faecal sludge emptying service providers. This is not
   surprising, as the cost for emptying events (USD 17 and USD 28 per
   trip) can be as high as half of the yearly household income in
   low-income areas [12,18]. These results could indicate that a
   significant proportion of accumulated faecal sludge in low-income areas
   ends up directly in the environment, which is in line with estimates of
   up to 75% of excreta in Kampala not being safely managed in very low-
   and low-income areas of Kampala [23]. Policies and regulations need to
   be developed for equitable access to sanitation, beyond just toilet
   facilities that also includes faecal sludge management.

3.3. Optimisation of Faecal Sludge Logistics

   An analysis of spatial GIS data can also be useful for reducing travel
   times and transport costs, thereby reducing overall costs of sanitation
   provision. Route analysis and road network modelling with hypothetical
   data of faecal sludge emptying, collection, and transport is possible
   in regions with well-established road networks; for example, in
   Switzerland [34]. However, this relies on basic assumptions, such as
   consistent speed limits, fuel consumption, truck volumes, containment
   volumes, and reduced idling with increased density. These assumptions
   are simply not viable in dense, urban, low-income cities in Sub-Saharan
   Africa, where fully-functional road networks do not even exist, and
   possible routing changes are not predictable.
   As road network analysis was not considered viable, analysis was
   performed with linear distance as an indication of how much travel
   distances could be reduced with additional treatment plants. Figure 7
   illustrates linear distances between emptying events and present
   location of Lubigi and Bugolobi treatment plants (a) and linear
   distances between emptying events, present location of Lubigi treatment
   plant, and future location of Kinawataka and Nalukolongo treatment
   plants (b). Figure 7a shows all emptying events in this study with
   average linear distance to existing treatment plants, compared to
   Figure 7b that includes the three treatment plants that are planned in
   the Kampala Sanitation Program [20]. The analysis reveals a reduction
   in linear distance from 6.4 km to 5.4 km. As more information on
   infrastructure, daily quantities of faecal sludge produced and
   delivered, and the possibility of transfer stations becomes available,
   this type of analyses could greatly increase the overall efficiency
   when siting treatment plants and transfer stations. For transfer
   stations to be effective in reducing transport costs, it would require
   onsite dewatering and treatment of supernatant, with dewatered sludge
   being transferred to treatment plants. In addition to reducing
   transport times, distances, and costs, it is known that there is an
   economy of scale for the level of centralisation and decentralisation
   of treatment facilities which could also be optimised, in addition to
   strategies to meet growth [35]. However, identifying locations for
   treatment plants and transfer stations is also part of a complex
   decision-making process that in addition to distances includes factors,
   such as planning restrictions, residents’ influence on decision-making,
   and the cost of land [15].
   The use of GIS tools for optimisation of faecal sludge collection and
   transport at city-wide scale provides an opportunity to increase
   sustainability of the planning and decision-making process by
   increasing access to service provision and reducing faecal sludge
   transport times and costs. The method is applicable anywhere, but
   variables need to be adapted to the local situation; for example,
   sufficiently detailed spatial data (e.g., GIS map layers or
   crowd-sourced information). However, the analyses in this study were
   limited to mechanical emptying service providers. To increase the
   benefits for planning of city-wide sanitation service provision, and
   the potential for optimisation, the methodology could be extended to
   include logistics of manual and informal emptying, direct discharges,
   and non-emptiable types of containment.

4. Conclusions

   The benefits of employing GIS analyses as a component of planning
   include:
     * Access to sanitation: Identifying areas that lack adequate access
       to sanitation for priority intervention by local municipalities to
       increase equity of service coverage.
     * Underserved areas: Identifying areas where manual or mechanical
       private entrepreneurs could profitably increase service provision,
       and increase access to faecal sludge management.
     * Future demand: Identifying areas with rapidly growing and high
       population densities with a need for increased service provision.
     * Identify service areas: Locating areas outside of the municipal
       boundaries, which are being served by treatment plants within
       boundaries.
     * Optimise locations: Siting of treatment plants and transfer
       stations to optimise transport distances could greatly reduce
       transport costs and impacts to traffic.
     * Quantification and characterisation: Identifying sources of faecal
       sludge, which could be combined with other tools to increase
       accuracy of quantification and characterisation for appropriate
       design.
     * Existing infrastructure: Optimising usage of existing
       infrastructure.

Abstract

   Recommender systems have gained a lot of popularity due to their large
   adoption in various industries such as entertainment and tourism.
   Numerous research efforts have focused on formulating and advancing
   state-of-the-art of systems that recommend the right set of items to
   the right person. However, these recommender systems are hard to
   compare since the published evaluation results are computed on diverse
   datasets and obtained using different methodologies. In this paper, we
   researched and prototyped an offline evaluation framework called
   Sequeval that is designed to evaluate recommender systems capable of
   suggesting sequences of items. We provide a mathematical definition of
   such sequence-based recommenders, a methodology for performing their
   evaluation, and the implementation details of eight metrics. We report
   the lessons learned using this framework for assessing the performance
   of four baselines and two recommender systems based on Conditional
   Random Fields (CRF) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), considering
   two different datasets. Sequeval is publicly available and it aims to
   become a focal point for researchers and practitioners when
   experimenting with sequence-based recommender systems, providing
   comparable and objective evaluation results. View Full-Text

Abstract

   :
   Concentrations of ambient fine particles (PM[10]: particles with an
   aerodynamic diameter ≤ 10 µm) are still exceeding current air quality
   standards in many European cities. In Munich (Germany), low emission
   zone and transit bans for heavy-duty vehicles were introduced in 2008
   aiming at reduction of traffic emissions contribution to PM[10]. The
   effects of those measures on PM[10] mass concentrations in Munich were
   investigated with a semiparametric regression model for modeling PM[10]
   levels adjusted for time, background pollution, public holidays and
   wind direction. The reduction of PM[10] concentration after the
   introduction of the measures was larger at a traffic monitoring site
   (13.0 %, 19.6 % in summer, and 6.8 % in winter) and smaller in urban
   background (4.5 %, 5.7 % in summer, and 3.2 % in winter). The effect
   was most pronounced on Fridays and on the weekends in summer.

1. Introduction

   In recent years, epidemiological studies have shown consistent
   associations between exposure to air pollution and cardio-respiratory
   morbidity and mortality [1,2,3]. The effects were partially attributed
   to traffic-related air pollutants such as fine particles, diesel soot
   or ultrafine particles in ambient air as well as other indicators of
   road traffic exposures, such as living or working close to major roads
   or nitrogen oxides [4,5,6,7]. Besides other ambient particle sources
   including e.g. industry and domestic heating, traffic emissions are
   supposed to have a significant impact on the local air quality and to
   contribute to the observed adverse health effects on humans.
   In 1999, the European Commission established limit values for PM[10]
   and some other air pollutants in the Air Quality Daughter Directive
   1999/30/EC [8], which was replaced in 2008 by the new Directive
   2008/50/EC on ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe [9]. The
   existing air quality guidelines for PM[10] are currently being exceeded
   at many locations throughout Europe and Germany [10,11,12].
   As traffic emissions are among the main contributors to anthropogenic
   pollutant emissions in the urban air [13], the reduction of traffic
   emissions offers an efficient strategy for reducing PM[10] levels in
   urban air. One widely-used, non-technical measure to meet the policy
   targets for PM[10] is the implementation of Low Emission Zones (LEZs).
   In Germany, a LEZ is a defined area (mostly located around the city
   centre) where the vehicles that enter have to meet certain emissions
   standards. For entering the LEZ all vehicles have to be identified by
   color coded windscreen badges which are directly linked to the
   corresponding stages of European emission standards (Euro 2: red; Euro
   3: yellow; Euro 4: green). Petrol-driven vehicles equipped with a
   catalytic converter are principally assigned to the Euro 4 class and
   will be entitled to a green badge. In the first stage of operation all
   vehicles with a badge (red, yellow or green) are allowed to enter the
   LEZ. In stage 2, the LEZ can be accessed by vehicles displaying a
   yellow or green badge, whereas stage 3 of the LEZ allows access only to
   vehicles with a green badge.
   The first measure aiming reduction of PM[10] concentrations in ambient
   air in Munich was the introduction of a law forbidding transit of
   vehicles heavier than 3.5 tons through the city area on 1 February
   2008. This law forces all trucks without final destination in Munich to
   use the motorway ring A99 round around the city area. As a second
   measure the first stage of the LEZ became operative at 1 October 2008.
   In this stage, all vehicles with Euro 1 (or worse) were no longer
   allowed to enter and drive within the area of the LEZ. From 1 October
   2010 the second stage of the LEZ in Munich became effective; all
   vehicles with Euro 2 (red sticker or without any sticker) are not
   allowed to enter the LEZ. Stage 3 of the Munich LEZ has been in
   operation since 1 October 2012 and only vehicles with green batches are
   allowed within the LEZ.
   Currently, LEZs have been implemented in 13 European countries [14]. In
   Germany, 49 LEZs are in operation or in the planning stages [15]. Some
   local authorities in Germany estimated the expected impact of the LEZ
   on air quality prior to their implementation (mostly by dispersion
   modeling). The predicted reduction of PM[10] mass concentration in
   ambient air, which is currently regulated and therefore the focus of
   our examination, ranges from 2% to 10 % depending on the
   characteristics of the specific LEZ, its valid stage and the number of
   exceptional permissions for cars that fail to meet the required
   emission standards. However, the verifying of the predicted reduction
   of PM[10] levels by analyzing the measured PM[10] mass concentrations
   is difficult, due to large influence of meteorological conditions on
   the PM[10] levels [16].
   Several studies about the benefit of traffic regulation measures in
   European cities were already published. PM[10] and CO levels decreased
   after the introduction of the London congestion charging scheme [17,18]
   and PM[10] and NO[X] were reduced during a seven month test period of
   the congestion tax in Stockholm. Modest reductions in PM[10] and
   PM[2.5]were observed in four Danish cities as a consequence of the
   introduction of a LEZ [19]. Since the implementation of the London LEZ
   strong reductions of the particle number concentration were detected
   [20] and small changes in the PM concentration [21]. Boogaard et al.
   [22] found that local traffic policies were associated with reductions
   in PM[2.5] in five Dutch cities. In spite of the challenges, there have
   already been a few papers analyzing the effects of the German LEZs on
   the improvement of air quality [16,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30]. However,
   they mostly use rather simple (and varying) statistical approaches.
   Because these studies analyze different LEZs using different
   statistical methods, the results are difficult to compare insofar as
   different statistical approaches were used for the analyses.
   In the first study of LEZ impact in Munich, the adjustment for the
   influence of meteorological conditions on PM[10] levels was conducted
   with a reference monitoring station located in a regional background
   area close to the city [25]. A relative reduction of PM[10] levels has
   been seen at almost all involved monitoring sites and the relative
   decrease ranged from 5% up to 12 %. However, this analysis was applied
   on a rather short period and used descriptive statistical analyses
   only. Morfeld et al. [30] analysed the same data set using regression
   analyses for matched observations of subsequent years and have not
   found significant effects of the LEZ.
   In our study, we extended the period under investigation and improved
   the statistical approach of the analysis. We restrict here our analysis
   only on the PM[10] particle fraction. One reason for this restriction
   is that there are no data on other relevant particle characteristics
   (such as PM[2.5], Black Smoke or particle number concentration)
   available for Munich. Secondly, LEZs were introduced in Germany as a
   primary measure for reducing PM[10] and consequently the public debate
   about the effectiveness of LEZs is mainly focused on changes in this
   particle fraction. We compared the PM[10] concentrations before and
   after the LEZ implementation by applying of a semiparametric
   statistical model with first-order autoregressive errors on data in a
   time resolution of one hour. The estimated PM[10] levels were adjusted
   for PM[10] exposure at the reference station, wind direction, season,
   time throughout a week, and public holidays. Two questions were of
   interest: First, we investigated, whether a significant overall
   reduction of PM[10] levels adjusted for possible confounders could be
   detected following the implementation of the measures in Munich and
   whether the effect at the street site differed from the urban
   background site. Second, we examined the seasonal and diurnal variation
   of the air quality changes, which might have originated in the
   variations of the number of vehicles and of the composition of the
   vehicle fleet.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Study Area and Selection of the Monitoring Stations

   The study was conducted in Munich, Germany. In 2011, Munich had a
   population of approximately 1.41 million inhabitants in an area of
   310.4 km^2 and there were approximately 700,000 registered cars [31].
   The LEZ in Munich covers 44 km², which accounts for 14 % of the whole
   city area. However, 32 % of the city population lives in this area
   (Figure 1).

   Ijerph 11 05094 g001
   For our study, we obtained PM[10] data collected at two monitoring
   sites located within the LEZ: one urban background site, Lothstrasse
   (measurement height: 4 m over ground) and one street site,
   Prinzregentenstrasse (measurement height: 2.9 m over ground; distance
   to road: 3 m; 39,000 vehicles/day in 2007–2010) [32,33]. The local
   traffic contributes with 22 % to the PM[10] levels at the measurement
   site Prinzregentenstrasse and to 6 % at the site Lothstrasse [33]. A
   regional background site in the outskirts of the city and outside the
   LEZ in Johanneskirchen was selected as a reference site (measurement
   height: 4 m over ground; distance to road: 5 m). All three monitoring
   stations are operated by the Bavarian Environment Agency (Bayerisches
   Landesamt für Umwelt, Augsburg, Germany) as part of the Bavarian
   Monitoring System for Air Quality (LÜB: Lufthygienisches
   Landesüberwachungssystem Bayern) (Figure 1). The remaining three
   monitoring stations were not involved in the analysis and are not shown
   in Figure 1. Two of them (Luise-Kiesselbach-Platz, Landshuter Allee)
   are located at the border of the LEZ and one (Stachus) were excluded as
   construction and tram track maintenance was conducted between August
   2008 and April 2010 in the vicinity of this monitoring site.

2.2. Study Period and Data

   In our analysis, we compared the PM[10] concentrations measured prior
   to the implementation of any air quality measures (period 1) with the
   PM[10] levels measured after the measures became effective (period 2).
   Data on PM[10] mass concentrations in an hourly time resolution were
   used for the analysis. The analysis period 1 was selected from 1
   February 2006 until 31 January 2008. In the period between 1 February
   2008 and 30 September 2008, only a truck transit ban was effective.
   This period was excluded from the analysis because it was too short to
   draw general conclusions. The examination period 2 (both transit ban
   for heavy-duty vehicles and LEZ in stage 1 were effective) covered the
   rest of the data between 1 October 2008 and 30 September 2010. PM[10]
   records at the Prinzregentenstrasse were only available until 31 June
   2010, because the station was closed. The PM[10] values on 1 January
   were excluded from the analysis for each year due to the traditional
   New Year’s Eve fireworks.
   Hourly measurements of the wind direction in 36 angle categories
   representative for the city of Munich (measured ca. 4 km northwest of
   the inner city of Munich) were obtained from the German National
   Meteorological Service.

2.3. Statistical Analysis

   The urban PM[10] levels were assumed to be mainly driven by the
   following factors: The measurements at the reference station
   represented the regional background pollution level, which was mostly
   not affected by the measures. Therefore, the PM[10] levels of the
   reference station reflected the changes of the PM[10] levels of the
   station of interest owing to meteorological conditions, the background
   PM[10] levels and long term temporal trends in PM[10]. Despite large
   scale effects of the wind direction, which were represented through the
   reference station, local effects of the wind direction occur due to the
   position of the measurement stations in the local vicinity, e.g.
   regarding to nearby factories or park areas.
   Since our data comprise only four years of measurements, long term
   temporal trends at the stations within the LEZ beyond the trends at the
   reference station could not be considered in the model and are of minor
   relevance. However, seasonal variation in PM[10] concentration occurred
   (see Supplemental Material, Figure S1), which possibly may change the
   effect of the measures. Hourly PM[10] levels are subject to daily
   cyclic variation due to heating and also due to traffic; therefore, the
   measures may also affect the temporal pattern of PM[10] levels. Public
   holidays during weekdays may yield deviations from the usual
   concentration levels.
   A semiparametric model with first-order autoregressive errors (refer to
   Clifford et al. [34] for a Bayesian implementation of a similar model
   for ultrafine particle number concentrations) was used to estimate the
   association between air pollution and the introduction of measures:
   log(PM[10x]) = β[0] + β[1] log(PM[10ref]) + β[SM] · I[SM] + β[W] · I[W]
   + β[WM] · I[WM] + f[S](hour) · I[S] + f[SM](hour) · I[SM] + f[W](hour)
   · I[W] + f[WM](hour) · I[WM] + f[wd](wind direction) + β[2](public
   holiday) + ε .
   (1)
   The effects of the corresponding covariates were denoted with β.The
   outcome variable was the logarithmically transformed PM[10] mass
   concentration at an urban station, which is denoted by log(PM[10][x]).
   I[S], I[W,] I[SM], I[WM] denote the indicator function for “summer
   without measures”, “winter without measures”, “summer with measures”
   and ”winter with measures”, respectively. The winter season was defined
   from October to March, the summer season from April to September.
   The following variables were considered as confounding factors:
   logarithmically transformed PM[10] levels at the reference station
   (log(PM[10][ref])), a smooth, cyclic effect based on P-splines with
   maximum four degrees of freedom of the wind direction, f[wd](wind
   direction), and an indicator for public holidays (public holiday).
   Adjusting for the PM[10] measurements at the reference station prevents
   from “regression to the mean” [35], improves the power of the model in
   comparison to the analysis of differences [36] and allows flexible and
   simple adjustments for other confounders. We selected the confounder
   variables by a priori considerations. Since we include an adjustment by
   the reference station with similar temperature and precipitation, we
   did not use these variables in the confounder model. Since wind
   direction has a local effect, which differs from the effect at the
   reference station, we included the variable wind direction in our
   model.
   In addition, the model was adjusted for deterministic seasonal
   components, similar to [37]. The effect of the measures (M) was
   analyzed separately for summer (S) and winter (W) to allow for seasonal
   variability. Daily and daytime-specific deviations were modeled with an
   hourly-resolved weekly season-specific trend, f[S](hour) · I[S],
   f[SM](hour) · I[SM], f[W](hour) · I[W], f[WM](hour) · I[WM] Cyclic
   penalized splines were used as basis functions for a smooth
   nonparametric estimation. Permitting a maximum number of 49 degrees of
   freedom, the model reached enough flexibility to describe the daytime
   dependent variability of the traffic.
   Percentage changes of PM[10] levels were modeled through logarithmic
   concentration levels [37]. In particular, it was suggested that the
   measures, the public holidays and the seasons yielded to percentage
   effects on the PM[10] concentration.
   Note, that the usage of the semiparametric model lessens the problem of
   scale. Furthermore, the highly skewed distribution of the PM[10] mass
   concentration was another reason for using the logarithmic
   transformation.
   Since the measurements are not independent, an autoregressive process
   of order 1 is simultaneously modeled for the error term ε.
   The overall effect of the measures was examined for each of the two
   seasons with a test on the hypotheses whether the effect coefficients
   for winter and summer differ between the periods with and without
   measures:
   H[0] : β[W] = β[WM],β[SM] = 0
   (2)
   Day-specific effects were investigated using an appropriate linear
   combination of the effect coefficients, representing the area between
   the smooth effect with and without measures. The inference for the
   day-specific effects was based on the asymptotic normality of linear
   combinations (for more details see Supplemental Material, “Modelling of
   day specific effects”).
   Statistical calculations were conducted using R [38], version 2.15.3;
   semiparametric models were estimated with the package “mgcv” [39],
   version 1.7-22.

3. Results

3.1. Data Description

   Figure 2 shows the weekly means of PM[10] concentrations at the two
   monitoring sites within the LEZ (Prinzregentenstrasse and Lothstrasse)
   and at the reference site in Johanneskirchen. Weekly means were chosen
   to display the trend of PM[10] levels for reasons of clarity and
   reducing the point-to-point variation.

   The PM[10] concentrations were higher in the winter season and lower in
   the summer season. In particular, elevated PM[10] levels were observed
   between January and March. The means of the unadjusted PM[10] mass
   concentrations before and after the implementation of measures are
   given in Table 1.
   At both urban stations, a decrease of PM[10] in period 2 (compared to
   period 1) was observed. The decrease at Prinzregentenstrasse (−14.0% in
   summer, −1.9% in winter) was larger in summer and similar in winter as
   at Lothstrasse (−2.3% in summer, −2.5% in winter). At the reference
   station in Johanneskirchen, also differences between the two periods
   were detected (−2.1% in summer, −0.8% in winter). The PM[10]
   concentration was on average 27.6% at Prinzregentenstrasse and 12.5% at
   Lothstrasse higher (median percentage difference) than at the reference
   station. While considering mere mean concentrations the impact of
   confounding factors like meteorological conditions were disregarded;
   the regression analysis in section 3.2 allowed for these confounders.
   The Spearman correlation coefficients between the hourly means of
   PM[10]concentration measured at the three monitoring sites were high
   and ranged from 0.69 to 0.88, the correlations between the daily
   averages were even slightly stronger (ranged from 0.83 to 0.96). The
   hourly PM[10] concentrations at the three monitoring sites were highly
   autocorrelated with autocorrelation coefficients between 0.87 and 0.92.
   The temporal trend of the annual means observed at the urban background
   site Lothstrasse and the regional background site (as the reference
   site) in Johanneskirchen was very similar. It indicates that both sites
   were not influenced by any local sources of PM. Even more, the PM[10]
   values obtained at the measurement site in Johanneskirchen were very
   similar and strong correlated with the PM[10] values observed at a
   regional background site located at the campus of the Bavarian Agency
   for Environmental Protection in Augsburg, Germany (about 90 km linear
   distance from Johanneskirchen).

3.2. Statistical Modeling

   According to equation (1), the PM[10] concentrations at a specific
   monitoring site were calculated for “summer without measures” and
   “winter without measures” as well as “summer with measures” and “winter
   with measures”, respectively. In Table 2, the relative differences
   between the periods with and without measures are shown for
   Prinzregentenstrasse (street site) and Lothstrasse (urban background
   site), and indicated separately for the summer and winter season.

   Note: adjusted for exposure at the reference station, wind direction,
   day of the week, time of the day and public holidays.
   The effects of the air quality measures differ at the two measurement
   stations as well as between the seasons. A stronger reduction in PM[10]
   mass concentrations was observed at the street site; on average 19.6%
   (5.4 µg/m^3, p-value: <0.001) in summer and 6.8% (2.1 µg/m^3, p-value:
   <0.001) in winter, respectively. At the urban background site
   Lothstrasse smaller decreases were estimated: 5.73% (1.1 µg/m^3,
   p-value: <0.001) in summer and 3.18% (0.7 µg/m^3, p-value: <0.003) in
   winter. If we had not have determined separate effects for the two
   seasons, the reduction of the PM[10] concentration by the measures at
   Prinzregentenstrasse would have been estimated with 13.0% (p-value:
   <0.001) and with 4.5%; (p-value: <0.001) at Lothstrasse.
   Figure 3 shows the temporal patterns of the modeled PM[10]
   concentrations at Prinzregentenstrasse and Lothstrasse for the periods
   with and without measures (adjusted for PM[10] concentration at the
   reference station, wind direction and public holidays). Temporal
   variability of PM[10] levels occurred between the seasons, the weekdays
   and times of day. The concentrations were higher in the winter months.
   The morning and afternoon rush hour peaks during the working days were
   clearly visible especially at Prinzregentenstrasse. The morning peak in
   the summer months was more clearly separated from the afternoon peak as
   in the winter season. The efficiency of the measures depended on the
   time of the day (see also Supplemental Material, Figure S2) and
   followed a diurnal pattern. Due to the implemented measures the PM[10]
   burden was stronger reduced during hours with higher relative and
   absolute PM[10] mass concentration, i.e. between the morning and
   afternoon rush hour peaks. The rush hour peaks themselves were reduced
   and there seemed to be lesser spillover from the morning to the
   afternoon. Furthermore, the improving of air quality during the nights
   on workdays was faster at the street site. The effect of the measures
   vanishes during night-time of the first days of the working week.
   The mean daily effects of both measures (stratified by season and week
   day) are shown in Figure 4 for each day of the week separately. In the
   summer season, the effect of the measures for each day of the week was
   at the street site stronger than in winter, whereas this tendency is
   not observed at the background site. However, at both sites the
   strongest effects were observed on Fridays (−25.0% in summer and −16.4%
   in winter at street site, −8.2% in summer and −6.1% in winter at the
   background site) and Saturdays (−25.9% in summer at street site, −11.4%
   in summer and −5.3% in winter at the background site). On Sunday a
   strong seasonal dependency of the effect was observed: the measures
   were only effective in summer.
   The effects of the linearly modeled confounding covariates are
   displayed in Supplemental Material, Table S1. The logarithmic values of
   the reference station had a significant, additive effect of log(1.381)
   = 0.323 at Prinzregentenstrasse and log(1.972) = 0.679 at Lothstrasse.
   Public holidays led to a reduction of PM[10] levels in the ambient air
   by approximately 13%. Since the estimated autocorrelation coefficient
   was relatively high (Prinzregentenstrasse: ρ = 0.70, Lothstrasse: ρ =
   0.54), the bigger part of the autocorrelation of the PM[10]
   measurements could not be explained through the inclusion of the smooth
   components in the predictor. The model for the measurements at
   Prinzregentenstrasse explained 74.5% of the variability in the data and
   the model for the Lothstrasse 83.0%.
   The shape of the smooth effect of wind direction indicates decreased
   PM[10] levels, if the wind blew from the South or West at Lothstrasse
   and if the wind blew from North or East at Prinzregentenstrasse (data
   not shown). We focused our analysis on PM[10], because the reason for
   the establishment of the LEZ exceeded PM[10] limit values.

4. Discussion

4.1. Impact of the Measures on PM[10] Mass Concentration

   We investigated whether changes in PM[10] levels after the introduction
   of a truck transit ban through the city area and the implementation of
   the first stage of the LEZ in Munich could be detected by analysis of
   emission data on PM[10] mass concentration collected at an urban
   background and a street monitoring site. The comparison of the PM[10]
   mass concentrations (adjusted for exposure at the reference station,
   wind direction, day of the week, time of the day and public holidays
   and calculated separately for summer and winter seasons in a
   semiparametric model with first-order autoregressive errors) showed a
   large relative decrease of PM[10] levels at the street site (13.0%,
   p-value: <0.001), whereas the relative decrease observed at the urban
   background monitoring site was smaller (4.5%, p-value: <0.001). The
   decrease of PM[10] mass concentration predicted in Munich by dispersion
   modeling ranges between 2% and 10 % depending on the monitoring sites
   and the active stage of the LEZ [40]. The maximal reduction (up to 10
   %) was predicted only for the third stage of the LEZ. The changes of
   PM[10] concentrations detected at the street site in our study are
   larger than the reductions predicted a priori and are also larger than
   those observed in the most other German cities [16,23,24,26,27,28,29].
   In general, the implementation of LEZ could influence the composition
   of the car fleet as well as the traffic intensity. The percentage of
   registered vehicles without any badge (Euro 1 or less) decreased during
   the time period 2007–2010 from 9.2% to 2.5% for passenger cars and from
   31.5% to 24.1% for trucks, respectively. In the same time the
   percentage of vehicles with green badge increased from 78.4% to 89.6%
   for passenger cars and from 19.0% to 36.1% for trucks, respectively.
   Those changes are especially pronounced between the years 2007 and
   2008, it means immediately before the implementation of the LEZ in
   Munich [41]. Such an extraordinary modernization of vehicle fleet in
   the city towards low-emission cars was reported also for Berlin [28].
   Note that there is only information about the in Munich registered
   vehicles; no such information is available about the car fleet
   composition in flowing traffic in the city. Regarding the flowing
   traffic it can be assumed that the older vehicles are less often in use
   compared to the newer vehicles.
   For the dispersion modelling, it was assumed that the traffic intensity
   remained constant over the time period 2007–2010. However, the analyses
   presented here are not only considering the impact of the LEZ alone,
   but also the additional impact of the transit ban for all trucks. The
   transit ban for trucks could affect the PM[10] levels even to a larger
   extent than the LEZ, which operated in the analyzed period in the first
   stage only. It leads not solely to a reduction of particles emitted by
   vehicle exhaust, but also to a reduction of particles originated from
   tyre and brake wear or dust re-suspension. Due to the ban on driving
   for trucks on Sunday, the effect for Sunday can be directly ascribed to
   the implementation of the LEZ. A similar pattern was found for
   Saturday, but only at Prinzregentenstrasse. This lead us to the
   assumption that in winter, the vehicle fleet on weekends in the city
   and on Sundays in the urban background was the same before and after
   the introduction of the LEZ, whereas this was not the case during the
   summer season.
   In the previous study estimating the LEZ impact in Munich, a slightly
   weaker effect of 12.3% relative reduction of PM[10] mass concentration
   at Prinzregentenstrasse was found [25]. The analysis was based on the
   comparison of relative PM[10] concentration changes by a reference
   station. However, such analysis of the quotient between the specific
   monitoring station and the reference station neglects the uncertainty
   of the measurements at the reference station. Further regression
   analyses on the ratio as used in the previous study revealed a
   comparably poor model fit (data not shown). This is also denoted by the
   strong deviation of the estimation of the intercept from 1 in our
   analysis. For comparison, we also analyzed the same period as described
   in Cyrys et al. [25] by use of the model applied in our study. We only
   found negligible (statistically insignificant) changes of the PM[10]
   mass concentration (Prinzregenstrasse −1.05%, p-value: 0.855;
   Lothstrasse: 2.42%, p-value: 0.499), as it was similarly found by
   Morfeld et al. [30]. For further comparisons of the approach used in
   our study with other modelling approaches we refer to the “comparison
   of different modeling approaches” section in the Supplemental Material.
   The results of our study are not directly comparable to the results
   obtained for other measures of traffic reduction, which were already
   introduced in some European cities. We analyzed here the common effect
   of the implementation of LEZ and transit ban for trucks in Munich and
   we are aware that such combination is not that common. Even if we might
   be able to evaluate the effects of the LEZ and transit ban for trucks
   separately, the comparison with other cites might remain difficult, as
   the regulations and areas of LEZ’s differ from city to city. The
   following discussion should compare rather roughly the range of the
   effects observed for different measures across Europe. Several studies
   analyzed the impact of congestion charging in London [17,18,42].
   Atkinson et al. [17] observed reductions in PM[10] only at the
   background monitor. The study conducted by Beevers and Carslaw [18]
   indicated that NO[x] and PM[10] emissions have been reduced by about
   12% in the charging zone, whereas the study of Tonne et al. [42] showed
   that the congestion charge schema led to only modest reductions in air
   pollutant concentrations across Greater London, but greater reductions
   in the charging zone. Ellison et al. [21] found that the LEZ in London
   had a significant effect on the composition of the vehicle fleet in
   London and reduced the PM[10] concentrations.
   Johansson and colleagues [43] assessed the effect of traffic congestion
   in Stockholm and concluded that the annual average NO[x] and PM[10]
   concentrations along the most densely trafficked streets would be lower
   by up to 12% and 7%, respectively. Note that the effects in the studies
   of Beevers and Carslaw [18], Tonne et al. [42] and Johansson et al.
   [43] were analyzed by dispersion modelling combined with regression
   calculation and were not verified by air quality measurements. PM[2.5]
   concentrations in Copenhagen were reduced by 5% after the introduction
   of the LEZ [19]. Unadjusted mean pollutants concentrations were lower
   after the implementation of the LEZ in five Dutch cities; the reduction
   in PM[2.5] levels was larger at urban streets (31%) than in the
   suburban background (20%) [22].
   The public debate is often focused solely on PM[10] concentrations (as
   this parameter is currently regulated) without taking into account that
   only the toxic fraction of PM[10] causes adverse human health effects
   [2,3,16]. Due to combustion processes particles originating from
   traffic exhibit a higher toxicity than particles from other sources;
   especially diesel-engine vehicles, which produce about 12% of the mean
   PM[10] exposure of the German population [44], emit these more toxic
   particles.
   Hence, the effectiveness of LEZ could be analyzed more precisely if
   Black Smoke (as marker for diesel soot) or the organic fraction of
   particles would be measured in ambient air instead of total PM[10]
   concentration [16]. Unfortunately, in Germany no routine measurements
   of Black Smoke concentrations in ambient air are conducted. Quadir and
   colleagues [45] reported recently significant lower concentrations for
   elemental carbon and some of particulate organic compounds after the
   introduction of the LEZ in Munich (the data were collected during
   special monitoring campaigns and not routinely by the monitoring
   network). Source apportionment analysis showed a reduction of traffic
   factor contribution by 60% after the implementation of the LEZ [45].
   Also in Berlin the concentration of soot particles decreased 2010 by
   52% compared with 2007 [29]. As climatic conditions in the years
   2008–2010 were adverse when compared to 2007, the authors attribute
   these results to the reduced traffic soot emissions. Currently, a
   debate about the pollution through PM[2.5] emerges, but the data
   material is insufficient because the monitoring of PM[2.5] is only at
   its early stages.
   In addition to dispersion modelling, estimating the expected changes of
   PM[10] mass concentration in the ambient air, our analysis evaluates
   the effects of the measures by analysis of the measured PM[10] values.
   However, the limitation of this strategy is, that also long-term
   changes of PM[10], which could not be explained by the included
   predictors, especially by the PM[10] levels of the reference station
   (for example changes in heating habits), are completely attributed to
   the LEZ effect.

4.2. Seasonal and Diurnal Variation of the Changes in PM[10] Levels

   The second objective of this study was the examination of the seasonal
   and diurnal variation of the detected air quality improvements. The
   extent of the PM[10] reduction at the background sites was largely
   similar in both seasons. In the urban background, exhaust particles
   represent a smaller fraction of fine particles compared to street site
   and the composition of particles varies less between winter and summer.
   On the contrary the difference between the two seasons was more
   pronounced at the street site, where the overall reduction of PM[10]
   mass concentrations was considerable larger as at the background site.
   At this site, the reduction of PM[10] levels due to the measures was
   larger during the summer season and smaller during the winter season.
   In winter, additional particle sources (such as domestic heating, wood
   combustion or combustion of other fossil fuels) contribute
   significantly to the PM[10] mass concentrations in the ambient air.
   Also the contribution of re-suspended dust to fine particles
   concentration in the ambient air increases in winter due to the
   application of road salt for deicing. In addition, the generation of
   secondary aerosols such as nitrate or sulfate is more intensive in
   winter. Consequently, exhaust particles represent a smaller fraction of
   the fine particles in winter than in summer. Therefore, the measures
   regulating only the exhaust particles became less effective in the
   winter period. In addition, adverse meteorological conditions leading
   to increased PM[10] levels from local mobile as well as stationary
   sources are occurring more frequently in the winter season. Our
   analysis suggests that in such episodes the influence of the
   implemented measures regulating the car exhaust is limited and that air
   quality is dominated by other unaffected mobile and stationary sources.
   The reduced rush hour peaks may indicate that a larger proportion of
   old cars no longer accessed the city during midday. Alternatively, the
   contribution of aged particles from the morning rush hours during day
   and night time might be shifted due to the reduction in diesel
   particles. Further, the temporal varying effect of the measures could
   be caused by the same reason as the differences between winter and
   summer season. One has to keep in mind that the morning and afternoon
   rush hour peaks seem to be more separated in summer not due to
   differences in traffic flow between summer and winter, but as a result
   of the combination of increased traffic intensity and increased solar
   radiation in summer.

5. Conclusions

   In our study we evaluated the effectiveness of two measures (a truck
   transit ban through the city area and implementation of LEZ) on the
   reduction of PM[10] mass concentrations in the ambient air in Munich,
   Germany. The analysis of the routinely collected PM[10] mass
   concentrations data by a semiparametric regression model showed
   statistically significant reduction of PM[10] levels at a monitoring
   site located in the direct vicinity of a highly frequented road and to
   a lesser extent at an monitoring site located in the urban background.
   The statistical regression modeling was essential to identify the size
   of the effect. The magnitude of the effect at the street site was
   larger in summer season; smaller seasonal variation was observed at the
   urban background site. In general, the magnitude of the effect depends
   on day of the week, time of the day and location of the monitoring
   site.
   Our analysis indicates that the assessment of the impact of measures
   aiming improvement of air quality in urban air could be conducted by
   use of routinely collected PM[10] data. However, as the expected
   reduction of PM[10] concentration after implementation of LEZ is in
   order of about 10%, the evaluation of this measure by PM[10] data
   remains difficult; other particulate variables, such as PM[2.5], Black
   Smoke, or particulate organic compounds are recommended for such
   evaluation.

Abstract

   The majority of residents in low- and middle-income countries are
   served by onsite sanitation. Equitable access to sanitation, including
   emptying, collection, and transport services for the accumulation of
   faecal sludge remains a major challenge. Comprehensive information on
   service coverage by mechanical faecal sludge emptying service providers
   is lacking. The purpose of this study is to analyse the spatial
   distribution of service coverage and identify areas without faecal
   sludge emptying services in Kampala, Uganda. The study uses GIS
   (geographic information systems) as a tool to analyse real-time data of
   service providers based on GPS (global positioning system) units that
   were installed in a representative number of trucks. Of the total
   recorded 5653 emptying events, 27% were located outside Kampala city
   boundaries. Of those within Kampala city boundaries, 37% were
   classified as non-household customers. Areas without service provision
   accounted for 13% of the total area. Service provision normalised by
   population density revealed much greater service provision in medium-
   and high-income areas than low- and very low-income areas. The employed
   method provides a powerful tool to optimise faecal sludge management on
   a city-wide scale by increasing sustainability of the planning and
   decision-making process, increasing access to service provision and
   reducing faecal sludge transport times and costs. View Full-Text

   Abstract
   Since 2012, the Italian Ministry of Health has recommended to improve

   Since 2012, the Italian Ministry of Health has recommended to improve
   the surveillance of adverse events following the
   measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) tetravalent vaccine that was
   provided in the official immunization schedule of some Italian regions
   for children during the second year of life. This recommendation was
   based on data from some surveys that showed an additional risk of
   seizure following the administration of this vaccine. Responding to the
   Ministry commitment, the Puglia Region launched, from May 2017 to
   November 2018, a post-marketing active surveillance program of adverse
   events following MMRV immunization (AEFIs). Immunized children (second
   year of life) were enrolled on a voluntary basis, AEFIs diaries were
   used, and their parents were interviewed 25 days after the
   immunization. There were 2540 children enrolled; 2149/2540 (84.6%)
   completed the post-vaccination follow-up. Of these, 992 AEFIs were
   registered with a reporting rate of 46.2 × 100 doses: 883/992 (89.0%)
   AEFIs were not serious, while 109/992 (11.0%) were serious. For serious
   AEFIs, the evaluation of causality assessment was performed using the
   algorithm proposed by the World Health Organisation (WHO): 82/109
   consistent causal associations to MMRV immunization were detected
   (reporting rate of consistent AEFIs: 3.8 × 100 follow-up). All serious
   AEFIs consistently associated with immunization resulted completely
   resolved at the follow-up. The reporting rate of seizure consistently
   associated with immunization was 0.05 × 100, lower than data previous
   published in the literature that did not report the causality
   assessment. Because no emerging signals were detected, our data from
   the active surveillance program confirmed the safety profile of the
   MMRV vaccine. Full article

   The activation of halogen bonding by the substitution of the
   pentafluoro-λ^6-sulfanyl (SF[5]) group was studied using a series of
   SF[5]-substituted iodobenzenes. The simulated electrostatic potential
   values of SF[5]-substituted iodobenzenes, the ab initio molecular
   orbital calculations of intermolecular interactions of
   SF[5]-substituted iodobenzenes with pyridine, and the ^13C-NMR
   titration experiments of SF[5]-substituted iodobenzenes in the presence
   of pyridine or tetra (n-butyl) ammonium chloride (TBAC) indicated the
   obvious activation of halogen bonding, although this was highly
   dependent on the position of SF[5]-substitution on the benzene ring. It
   was found that 3,5-bis-SF[5]-iodobenzene was the most effective halogen
   bond donor, followed by o-SF[5]-substituted iodobenzene, while the m-
   and p-SF[5] substitutions did not activate the halogen bonding of
   iodobenzenes. The similar ortho-effect was also confirmed by studies
   using a series of nitro (NO[2])-substituted iodobenzenes. These
   observations are in good agreement with the corresponding Mulliken
   charge of iodine. The 2:1 halogen bonding complex of
   3,5-bis-SF[5]-iodobenzene and 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) was
   also confirmed. Since SF[5]-containing compounds have emerged as
   promising novel pharmaceutical and agrochemical candidates, the
   3,5-bis-SF[5]-iodobenzene unit may be an attractive fragment of
   rational drug design capable of halogen bonding with biomolecules. Full

   Background and Objectives: Diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HT)
   are characterized by cell damage caused by inflammatory and metabolic
   mechanisms induced by alteration in reduction-oxidative status. Serum
   advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) are new markers of protein
   damage induced by oxidative stress. We evaluated serum levels of AOPP
   in a cohort of patients with DM and HT, with or without renal
   complications, compared with a control healthy population. Materials
   and Methods: The study group comprised of 62 patients with type 2 DM
   and 56 with HT. The 62 patients affected by DM were further
   distinguished in 24 subjects without renal impairment, 18 with diabetic
   nephropathy (DN), 20 with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 2–3
   secondary to DN. The subgroup of 56 patients with primary HT comprised
   26 subjects without renal complications and 30 with CKD (stage 2–3)
   secondary to HT. Thirty healthy controls, matched for age and sex, were
   recruited among blood donors. Results: Increased AOPP levels were found
   in DM patients compared with healthy subjects, although not
   significantly. This index was higher and more significant in patients
   with DN and CKD secondary to DN than in DM patients without nephropathy
   (p < 0.05) or controls (p < 0.0001). Patients with HT and with kidney
   impairment secondary to HT also had significantly higher AOPP serum
   levels than controls (p < 0.01 and p < 0.0001, respectively). There
   were no significant differences in mean AOPP levels among DM and HT
   patients. Conclusion: Our study showed that oxidative stress was higher
   in diabetic or hypertensive subjects than in healthy controls and, in
   particular, it appeared to be more severe in patients with renal
   complications. We suggest that the assessment of AOPP in diabetic and
   hypertensive patients may be important to predict the onset of renal
   failure and to open a new perspective on the adoption of antioxidant
   molecules to prevent CKD in those settings. Full article

   Helicobacter pylori infection is a WHO class 1 carcinogenic factor of
   gastric adenocarcinoma. In the past decades, many studies have
   demonstrated the increasing trend of antibiotic resistance and pointed
   out the necessity of new effective treatment. This study was aimed at
   identifying phytochemicals that can inhibit H. pylori and possibly
   serve as adjuvant treatments. Here, in silico molecular docking and
   drug-like properties analyses were performed to identify potential
   inhibitors of urease, shikimate kinase and aspartate-semialdehyde
   dehydrogenase. These three enzymes are targets of the treatment of H.
   pylori. Susceptibility and synergistic testing were performed on the
   selected phytochemicals and the positive control antibiotic,
   amoxicillin. The in-silico study revealed that oroxindin, rosmarinic
   acid and verbascoside are inhibitors of urease, shikimate kinase and
   aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase, respectively, in which, oroxindin
   has the highest potency against H. pylori, indicated by a minimum
   inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 50 μg/mL. A combination of
   oroxindin and amoxicillin demonstrated additive effects against H.
   pylori, as indicated by a fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC)
   value of 0.75. This study identified phytochemicals that deserve
   further investigation for the development of adjuvant therapeutic
   agents to current antibiotics against H. pylori. Full article

   Background: Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) is a binary approach
   to cancer therapy that requires accumulation of boron atoms
   preferentially in tumour cells. This can be achieved by using
   nanoparticles as boron carriers and taking advantage of the enhanced
   permeability and retention (EPR) effect. Here, we present the
   preparation and characterization of size and shape-tuned gold NPs
   (AuNPs) stabilised with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and functionalized
   with the boron-rich anion cobalt bis(dicarbollide), commonly known as
   COSAN. The resulting NPs were radiolabelled with ^124I both at the core
   and the shell, and were evaluated in vivo in a mouse model of human
   fibrosarcoma (HT1080 cells) using positron emission tomography (PET).
   Methods: The thiolated COSAN derivatives for subsequent attachment to
   the gold surface were synthesized by reaction of COSAN with
   tetrahydropyran (THP) followed by ring opening using potassium
   thioacetate (KSAc). Iodination on one of the boron atoms of the cluster
   was also carried out to enable subsequent radiolabelling of the boron
   cage. AuNPs grafted with mPEG-SH (5 Kda) and thiolated COSAN were
   prepared by ligand displacement. Radiolabelling was carried out both at
   the shell (isotopic exchange) and at the core (anionic absorption) of
   the NPs using ^124I to enable PET imaging. Results: Stable gold
   nanoparticles simultaneously functionalised with PEG and COSAN
   ([email protected][4]^−) with hydrodynamic diameter of 37.8 ± 0.5 nm,
   core diameter of 19.2 ± 1.4 nm and ξ-potential of −18.0 ± 0.7 mV were
   obtained. The presence of the COSAN on the surface of the NPs was
   confirmed by Raman Spectroscopy and UV-Vis spectrophotometry.
   [email protected][4]^− could be efficiently labelled with ^124I both at
   the core and the shell. Biodistribution studies in a xenograft mouse
   model of human fibrosarcoma showed major accumulation in liver, lungs
   and spleen, and poor accumulation in the tumour. The dual labelling
   approach confirmed the in vivo stability of the [email protected][4]^−.
   Conclusions: PEG stabilized, COSAN-functionalised AuNPs could be
   synthesized, radiolabelled and evaluated in vivo using PET. The low
   tumour accumulation in the animal model assayed points to the need of
   tuning the size and geometry of the gold core for future studies. Full

   The efficacy of radiosurgery for neurofibromatosis type 2
   (NF2)-associated vestibular schwannoma (VS) remains debatable. We
   retrospectively analyzed radiosurgical outcomes for NF2-associated VS
   compared to sporadic VS using our database of 422 consecutive VS
   patients. Twenty-five patients with 30 NF2-associated VSs with a mean
   follow-up of 121 months were identified. NF2-associated VSs exhibited
   excellent tumor control (10-year cumulative rate, 92% vs. 92% in
   sporadic VSs; p = 0.945) and worse overall survival (73% vs. 97%; p =
   0.005), mainly due to tumor progression other than the treated VSs. The
   presence of NF2 was not associated with failed tumor control via
   multivariate Cox proportional hazard analyses. No difference in
   radiation-induced adverse events (RAEs) was confirmed between cohorts,
   and prescription dose (hazard ratio 8.30, 95% confidence interval
   3.19–21.62, p < 0.001) was confirmed as a risk for cranial nerve
   injuries via multivariate analysis. Further analysis after propensity
   score matching using age, volume, and sex as covariates showed that
   NF2-associated VSs exhibited excellent local control (100% vs. 93%; p =
   0.240) and worse overall survival (67% vs. 100%; p = 0.002) with no
   significant difference in RAEs. Excellent long-term tumor control and
   minimal invasiveness may make radiosurgery a favorable therapeutic
   option for NF2 patients with small to medium VS, preferably with
   non-functional hearing or deafness in combination with postoperative
   tumor growth or progressive non-operated tumors, or with functional
   hearing by patients’ wish. Full article

   Celecoxib (CEL) Nanocrystalline Solid Dispersion (CEL_NCSD) was
   generated by spray drying CEL, mannitol (MAN) and sodium lauryl sulfate
   (SLS) from a solvent mixture of methanol, acetone and water. The
   purpose of the work was to determine the size of CEL nanocrystals,
   investigate agglomeration and inspect dissolution of CEL_NCSD. Size
   determination was challenging as CEL nanocrystals are embedded in the
   matrix of MAN. Firstly, neat CEL_NCSD was analyzed using Scherrer
   equation. Secondly, MAN was dissolved in an aqueous stabilizer medium
   to selectively measure the size of CEL nanocrystals. Raman Spectra
   captured in Morphologi G3-ID confirmed the presence of CEL-only
   particles in the media. This dispersion gave D[90] values of 882 ±
   170.34 nm in Zetasizer. Discriminatory dissolution studies confirmed
   total release of 34.61 ± 1.59%, 47.42 ± 0.24%, and 44.61 ± 1.11% at 120
   min from a microsuspension (size 3 µm), a nanosuspension (media milled;
   size 660 nm) and CEL_NCSD, respectively. The dissolution profile of
   CEL_NCSD was similar to that of a nanosuspension (f2 72.24) instead of
   a coarse microsuspension. Thus, the present study revealed that
   optimized sample preparation is critical for the size determination of
   embedded drug nanocrystals in NCSD. Further, a discriminatory
   dissolution study substantiated that the size of CEL nanocrystals in
   CEL_NCSD is well below 1000 nm, thus showing a size-dependent improved
   dissolution profile. Full article

   The detection of shedded fibers in effluents from textile washing has
   attracted much attention due to its reported contribution to
   microplastic pollution. Commonly used analytical methods for fiber
   detection in liquids are based on filtration with subsequent
   microscopic analysis and/or gravimetric weighing. These approaches are
   time-consuming and prone to errors. In this study, an approach based on
   dynamic image analysis was applied in order to set up an efficient
   method to analyze fibers in effluents from washing processes. In an
   initial validation step, reliable information on the counts of fibers
   and the morphological characteristics were confirmed. For wastewaters
   from polyester-cotton blends, the chemical nature of the fiber debris
   (natural vs. synthetic origin) was determined by combining the dynamic
   image analysis with a chemical pre-treatment. In this study, dynamic
   image analysis was revealed as a rapid, non-destructive, precise, and
   reliable technology for the characterization and quantification of the
   fiber debris, offering a promising approach for fiber analysis in
   liquids. Full article

   In recent years, liver injury induced by Traditional Chinese Medicines
   (TCMs) has gained increasing attention worldwide. Assessing the
   hepatotoxicity of compounds in TCMs is essential and inevitable for
   both doctors and regulatory agencies. However, there has been no
   effective method to screen the hepatotoxic ingredients in TCMs
   available until now. In the present study, we initially built a large
   scale dataset of drug-induced liver injuries (DILIs). Then, 13 types of
   molecular fingerprints/descriptors and eight machine learning
   algorithms were utilized to develop single classifiers for DILI, which
   resulted in 5416 single classifiers. Next, the NaiveBayes algorithm was
   adopted to integrate the best single classifier of each machine
   learning algorithm, by which we attempted to build a combined
   classifier. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the
   curve of the combined classifier were 72.798, 0.732, 0.724, and 0.793,
   respectively. Compared to several prior studies, the combined
   classifier provided better performance both in cross validation and
   external validation. In our prior study, we developed a
   herb-hepatotoxic ingredient network and a herb-induced liver injury
   (HILI) dataset based on pre-clinical evidence published in the
   scientific literature. Herein, by combining that and the combined
   classifier developed in this work, we proposed the first instance of a
   computational toxicology to screen the hepatotoxic ingredients in TCMs.
   Then Polygonum multiflorum Thunb (PmT) was used as a case to
   investigate the reliability of the approach proposed. Consequently, a
   total of 25 ingredients in PmT were identified as hepatotoxicants. The
   results were highly consistent with records in the literature,
   indicating that our computational toxicology approach is reliable and
   effective for the screening of hepatotoxic ingredients in Pmt. The
   combined classifier developed in this work can be used to assess the
   hepatotoxic risk of both natural compounds and synthetic drugs. The
   computational toxicology approach presented in this work will assist
   with screening the hepatotoxic ingredients in TCMs, which will further
   lay the foundation for exploring the hepatotoxic mechanisms of TCMs. In
   addition, the method proposed in this work can be applied to research
   focused on other adverse effects of TCMs/synthetic drugs. Full article

   Diet plays a decisive role in heart physiology, with lipids having
   especial importance in pathology prevention and development. This study
   aimed to investigate how dietary lipids varying in lipid profile
   (virgin olive oil, sunflower oil or fish oil) affected the heart of
   rats during aging. Heart histopathology, mitochondrial morphometry, and
   oxidative status were assessed. Typical histopathological features
   associated with aging, such as valvular lesions, endomyocardical
   hyperplasia, or papillary muscle calcification, were found at a low
   extent in all the experimental groups. The most relevant finding was
   that inflammation registered by fish oil group was lower compared to
   the other treatments. At the ultrastructural level, heart mitochondrial
   area, perimeter, and aspect ratio were higher in fish oil-fed rats than
   in those fed on sunflower oil. Concerning oxidative stress markers,
   there were differences only in coenzyme Q levels and catalase activity,
   lower in sunflower oil-fed animals compared with those fed on fish oil.
   In summary, dietary intake for a long period on dietary fats with
   different fatty acids profile led to differences in some aspects
   associated with the aging process at the heart. Fish oil seems to be
   the fat most protective of heart during aging. Full article

   Surfaces covered with layers of ultrathin nanoantenna structures—so
   called metasurfaces have recently been proven capable of completely
   controlling phase of light. Metalenses have emerged from the advance in
   the development of metasurfaces providing a new basis for recasting
   traditional lenses into thin, planar optical components capable of
   focusing light. The lens made of arrays of plasmonic gold nanorods were
   fabricated on a glass substrate by using electron beam lithography. A
   1064 nm laser was used to create a high intensity circularly polarized
   light focal spot through metalens of focal length 800 µm, N.A. = 0.6
   fabricated based on Pancharatnam-Berry phase principle. We demonstrated
   that optical rotation of birefringent nematic liquid crystal droplets
   trapped in the laser beam was possible through this metalens. The
   rotation of birefringent droplets convinced that the optical trap
   possesses strong enough angular momentum of light from radiation of
   each nanostructure acting like a local half waveplate and introducing
   an orientation-dependent phase to light. Here, we show the success in
   creating a miniaturized and robust metalens based optical tweezers
   system capable of rotating liquid crystals droplets to imitate an
   optical motor for future lab-on-a-chip applications. Full article

   The Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) has reported many
   cases of different UV curing inks components in foodstuffs during the
   last few years. These contaminants reach foodstuffs mainly by set-off,
   their principal migration mechanism from the package. Under this
   premise, this work has tried to characterize the process of migration
   of two common UV ink components: a photoinitiator
   (4-Methylbenzophenone) and a coinitiator (Ethyl-4-(dimethylamino)
   benzoate), from the most common plastic material used in food packaging
   low-density polyethylene (LDPE) into six different food simulants. The
   migration kinetics tests were performed at four different common
   storage temperatures, obtaining the key migration parameters for both
   molecules: the coefficients of diffusion and partition. The migration
   process was highly dependent on the storage conditions, the
   photoinitiator properties and the pH of the foodstuff. Full article

   Soluble or fermentable fibre has prebiotic effects that can be used in
   the food industry to modify the composition of microbiota species to
   benefit human health. Prebiotics mostly target Bifidobacterium and
   Lactobacillus strains, among others, which can fight against chronic
   diseases since colonic fermentation produces short chain fatty acids
   (SCFAs). The present work studied the changes produced in the fibre and
   polyphenolic compounds during in vitro digestion of gel (AV) and a
   polysaccharide extract (AP) from Aloe vera, after which, these
   fractions were subjected to in vitro colonic fermentation to evaluate
   the changes in antioxidant capacity and SCFAs production during the
   fermentation. The results showed that the phenolic compounds increased
   during digestion, but were reduced in fermentation, as a consequence,
   the antioxidant activity increased significantly in AV and AP after the
   digestion. On the other hand, during in vitro colon fermentation, the
   unfermented fibre of AV and AP responded as lactulose and the total
   volume of gas produced, which indicates the possible use of Aloe vera
   and polysaccharide extract as prebiotics. Full article

   Aptamers are small oligonucleotides that are capable of binding
   specifically to a target, with impressive potential for analysis,
   diagnostics, and therapeutics applications. Aptamers are isolated from
   large nucleic acid combinatorial libraries using an iterative selection
   process called SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential
   enrichment). Since being implemented 30 years ago, the SELEX protocol
   has undergone many modifications and improvements, but it remains a
   laborious, time-consuming, and costly method, and the results are not
   always successful. Each step in the aptamer selection protocol can
   influence its results. This review discusses key technical points of
   the SELEX procedure and their influence on the outcome of aptamer
   selection. Full article

   Since 2012, more than three million Syrian refugees have fled to
   Turkey. While these refugees vary in socioeconomic background, it is
   notable that 50% of Syrian refugee children in Turkey display symptoms
   of post-traumatic stress and that more than 663,138 of these children
   between the ages of six and seventeen are not enrolled in school. For
   those children who are in school, high levels of trauma have
   significant implications for the education system as trauma alters the
   brain and affects the way children learn. A Global Voice for Autism is
   an international non-governmental relief and development organization
   that exists to equip teachers and families in conflict-affected
   communities. Its intent is to support the development and success of
   children with autism and trauma-related behavioral challenges in their
   classrooms, home, and communities. The instabilities inherent in the
   Syrian refugee experience pose a number of challenges to the
   organization’s effective implementation of programming. The experiences
   of refugees in Turkey are highly gendered. Therefore, a qualitative
   gender analysis was conducted to address and better understand the
   challenges faced when carrying out these educational interventions. The
   article examines domestic violence, sexual violence, and masculinity as
   gender-driven constructs that influence how refugees experience trauma.
   In addition, structural issues in existing support systems all present
   significant challenges to Syrian refugee parents that impede effective
   program implementation. It is imperative to assess structural issues in
   existing support services to address these challenges and to
   successfully carry out meaningful and impactful programming. This Brief
   Report provides a series of recommendations in order to ameliorate
   these challenges and increase the efficacy of educational interventions
   with Syrian refugee parents of trauma-affected and vulnerable children
   in Turkey. It concludes with a call for policy changes that protect
   refugees from deportation when accessing support services and a network
   of services that do not require residency permits. It calls for
   increased integration of parent trauma support in educational
   intervention trainings and the creation of safe spaces where mothers
   and fathers can discuss their own trauma and challenges in the hope of
   significantly enhancing program efficacy. Full article

Abstract

   :
   The majority of residents in low- and middle-income countries are
   served by onsite sanitation. Equitable access to sanitation, including
   emptying, collection, and transport services for the accumulation of
   faecal sludge remains a major challenge. Comprehensive information on
   service coverage by mechanical faecal sludge emptying service providers
   is lacking. The purpose of this study is to analyse the spatial
   distribution of service coverage and identify areas without faecal
   sludge emptying services in Kampala, Uganda. The study uses GIS
   (geographic information systems) as a tool to analyse real-time data of
   service providers based on GPS (global positioning system) units that
   were installed in a representative number of trucks. Of the total
   recorded 5653 emptying events, 27% were located outside Kampala city
   boundaries. Of those within Kampala city boundaries, 37% were
   classified as non-household customers. Areas without service provision
   accounted for 13% of the total area. Service provision normalised by
   population density revealed much greater service provision in medium-
   and high-income areas than low- and very low-income areas. The employed
   method provides a powerful tool to optimise faecal sludge management on
   a city-wide scale by increasing sustainability of the planning and
   decision-making process, increasing access to service provision and
   reducing faecal sludge transport times and costs.

1. Introduction

   Globally, 2.7 billion people rely on on-site sanitation with
   containment technologies, such as septic tanks and pit latrines [1]. In
   urban areas of Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, 65%–100% of the population
   is served by these technologies [1,2]. On-site sanitation can provide a
   sustainable and more affordable option to sewer-based sanitation,
   either as a standalone solution or in combination [3,4]. However,
   currently, there is a lack of sustainable management of faecal sludge,
   the material that accumulates in containment technologies. If faecal
   sludge is not emptied, collected, and delivered to appropriate
   treatment, there are serious impacts to public and environmental
   health. Emptying, collection and transport services are the critical
   link in city-wide faecal sludge management, from household-level users,
   to treatment for resource recovery and safe end-use or disposal [2,5].
   Providing sanitation is a public good and the responsibility of public
   authorities. Yet, private service providers also play a key role in
   faecal sludge management. Hence, cooperative public‑private
   partnerships are essential [6]. Faecal sludge is emptied manually or
   mechanically, both with distinct advantages and disadvantages [7,8].
   Manual service providers fulfil a crucial need in densely populated,
   low-income urban settlements (“slums”) with narrow roads or paths that
   are not accessible to trucks [9]. However, manual service provision is
   often informal and unhygienic. Additionally, this faecal sludge
   typically does not get transported to treatment but directly dumped in
   the surrounding environment, as appropriate solutions are lacking
   [10,11,12]. Mechanical emptying services are provided by motorised
   trucks with vacuum pumps. This is currently the most advanced
   technology for faecal sludge emptying, collection, and transport, based
   on efficiency and limited human contact with faecal matter. However,
   these services are costly. For example, in Kampala, fuel costs make up
   25% to 35% of the cost for emptying and transport [12]. A method to
   optimise logistics of city-wide emptying services could greatly reduce
   these costs.
   The use of logistical tools and information communications technology
   to analyse emptying services in low- and middle-income countries is
   limited. However, previous studies in the field of solid waste
   management have used spatial data imbedded in geographic information
   systems (GIS) for evaluating, visualising, and optimising the logistics
   of waste collection systems [13,14]. In the context of faecal sludge
   management, Kennedy-Walker et al. [15] implemented a model-based
   approach to reduce transport time of faecal sludge. Using the potential
   of available technologies and tools for analysis of transport routes
   between the location of faecal sludge emptying and discharge locations
   would allow for optimisation of many aspects of faecal sludge
   management.
   The objectives of this study were to use GPS (global positioning
   system) and GIS tools to identify the scale of operation of mechanical
   faecal sludge emptying services, and to evaluate ways to optimise
   faecal sludge logistics at a city-wide scale to increase access to
   equitable sanitation services. These innovative methodologies and tools
   for the analyses of faecal sludge management were found to be effective
   for this purpose.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Context Area

   This research was conducted in Kampala, the capital of Uganda. Kampala
   has a total area of 178 km^2 at an altitude of 1140 m, and a tropical
   climate with two rainy seasons. The city is divided into five municipal
   divisions (Central, Makindye, Rubaga, Kawempe, Nakawa), which are
   further divided into 99 parishes. Of the total city area, 64% is
   classified as residential with about 1.5 million inhabitants [16]. The
   population doubles during the day, as many people commute into the city
   [17]. Approximately 60% of the city residents live in informal
   low-income settlements, which cover 10.8% of the total city area
   [18,19]. Of the Kampala residents, 92.5% are served by on-site
   sanitation (projected for 2013), with pit latrines being the most
   prevalent containment technology (36.9%), followed by septic tanks
   (27.6%), ventilated improved pit latrines (26.1%), raised pit latrines
   (5.4%), public toilets (2.8%), and other (1.2%), including open
   defecation and bucket latrines [20].
   Faecal sludge in Kampala can only be legally discharged for treatment
   at two locations, the Bugolobi wastewater treatment plant or the Lubigi
   faecal sludge and wastewater treatment plant, both operated by the
   National Water and Sewerage Corporation (NWSC). Mechanical emptying
   service providers (vacuum trucks) and formal businesses operating with
   semi-mechanised emptying technologies (e.g., the Gulper—a direct lift
   pump that can be operated by a team of 2–3 people), discharge faecal
   sludge at either of these locations. Illegal dumping by these
   businesses has not been observed. However, it is known that within the
   informal sector (manual emptying), faecal sludge is dumped directly
   into the environment, along with pit latrines that are broken open at
   the bottom and directly drain into the environment [21]. Lubigi faecal
   sludge and wastewater treatment plant started operating in 2014, and
   was already at design capacity of 400 m^3 faecal sludge per day within
   the first months. The process flow includes settling/thickening tanks,
   followed by co-treatment of the supernatant with wastewater in
   stabilisation ponds, and drying beds for the solids. Bugolobi
   wastewater treatment plant has a design capacity of 32,000 m^3 of
   wastewater per day, and was not designed for the additional loading of
   faecal sludge [22]. However, since there are no other options
   available, discharge of faecal sludge at Bugolobi is allowed and
   constitutes around 200 m^3 per day to the influent. Hence, Bugolobi is
   not operating as designed or meeting effluent regulations due to solids
   overloading and technical difficulties. The treatment flow at Bugolobi
   consists of settling tanks with supernatant going to trickling filters,
   solids going to digesters (if operational) followed by drying beds.
   Overall, around 59% of excreta that is managed as faecal sludge is
   safely managed, for more detailed information, please refer to
   Schoebitz et al. [23].

2.2. Research Implementation

   The data collection took place between March and July 2015. A
   literature study and field observations were carried out to obtain an
   overview of the urban sanitation system and key stakeholders. A
   stakeholder analysis was conducted to assess the organisational
   structure, mode of operation, and responsibilities of faecal sludge
   emptying services. Collaborative working relationships were established
   to ensure transparent communication of the aims and objectives of the
   study, and to obtain permission of participants. Operating trucks,
   names of drivers, truck volume, working procedures, ownership, and
   association membership were recorded.

2.3. Data Collection

   study were equipped with a GPS data logger GT-730FL-S (CanMore
   Electronics Co.; Zhubei, Taiwan). This data logger was connected to an
   XTPower MP 10400 powerbank (Model PB-AS025) (DBK Electronics Co.;
   Shenzhen, China), which served as an external battery to allow
   continuous recording for approximately 7.5 days. The data logger was
   configured to create a waypoint every ten seconds. Data loggers and
   batteries were stored in closable plastic containers, packed with paper
   to prevent moisture accumulation and to provide a buffer to external
   influences. The container was placed behind the driver’s seat and
   exchanged on a weekly basis. Battery exchange and data export were
   performed at the treatment plants during faecal sludge discharge or
   while the truck was waiting there for customers. To support this task,
   an employee of the association was appointed and remunerated.

2.4. Data Interpretation

   CanWay software (CanWay, version 1.1.12; (CanMore Electronics Co.;
   Zhubei, Taiwan, 2016) was used to export recorded waypoints from the
   data loggers and GPS data were analysed with ArcGIS (ArcGIS, version
   10.2.2; Esri: Redlands, CA, USA, 2013). For the identification of
   faecal sludge emptying events, Python scripts were developed. The
   travel velocity was calculated by dividing time and distance between
   two waypoints. Prior to implementation of the study, field testing was
   conducted to evaluate the potential for kinematic errors. Emptying
   events were simulated by stopping the truck. While stopped, errors
   showing movement of 1–3 km/h were occasionally observed. To account for
   this error, trucks were only recorded as moving if their velocity was
   greater than 4 km/h. For trucks belonging to either the Private
   Emptiers Association (PEA) or the Kampala Private Emptiers Association
   (KPEA), an emptying event was defined as a period of more than 15 min
   without movement. For trucks belonging to the Kampala Capital City
   Authority (KCCA) this period was reduced to 10 min, as it was observed
   that KCCA trucks required less time for the process of emptying the
   containment. In addition, the following events were filtered out from
   the analyses:
     * Any event between 7 p.m. and 6 a.m., when the treatment plants are
       not open for discharge.
     * Any events longer than three hours, which were considered as
       waiting time.
     * Any events recorded at the treatment plant that were considered as
       discharge of faecal sludge or waiting time.

   To cross-check validity of the recorded emptying events, the total
   number was compared with obtained NWSC records from the treatment
   plants, where each discharge event is documented. In addition, factors
   that might affect the scale of emptying services were evaluated to
   determine the representativeness of the selected research period,
   including monthly precipitation (e.g., containment technologies fill up
   faster), increased income during crop harvest periods (e.g., increased
   income), and timing of school fees and public holidays (e.g.,
   decreasing emptying service requests due to extra expenditures).
   All identified emptying events that were recorded during the period of
   this research are provided as supplemental material to this paper,
   including year, month, day, and time, as well as the x- and
   y-coordinates of the event.

2.5. Data Analyses

   The following steps were performed to identify and interpret the scale
   of operation of mechanical faecal sludge emptying services:
     * GIS analyses of the spatial distribution of emptying events inside
       the boundaries of Kampala and the Greater Kampala Metropolitan
       Area, and outside the Greater Kampala Metropolitan Area.
     * GIS analyses of service coverage in low-income informal settlements
       with KCCA statistics [24]. A 100 m buffer was added to the
       perimeter of the designated boundaries of informal settlements to
       account for their informal nature, which means they do not have
       precise boundaries and are difficult to map, show an uncontrolled
       sprawl, and experience rapid growth [25].
     * Identification of high-frequency emptying services. Locations with
       more than six recorded emptying events during the research period
       (i.e., more than two emptying events per month) where defined as
       such, indicating a non-household origin of faecal sludge.
     * Identification of areas without service provision during the study
       period. For analysis, a 0.5 × 0.5 km grid that divides the area of
       Kampala into 809 cells, each of 0.25 km^2, was projected over the
       city map. A cell was defined as an area without service provision
       if no emptying event took place during the three month research
       period. This grid was, furthermore, applied to classify these areas
       into areas with and without residents.
     * To analyse the scale of service provision on the parish level, the
       emptying frequency was calculated (Equation 1). Population and area
       are based on data obtained from Fichtner Water and Transportation
       [20].

   (1)
   Areas with no residents, and previously identified locations with
   frequent emptying events, were excluded to ensure that the analyses
   were based only on household-level emptying services. R open-source
   software (R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing,
   version 3.3.2; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria,
   2016) was used for analyses [26].
   To evaluate how GIS analyses could contribute to optimisation of faecal
   sludge emptying, collection and transport logistics in Kampala, a
   location-allocation analysis was performed. For this analysis, the road
   network was used to identify the shortest travel distances between the
   currently operating treatment plants and the recorded emptying events.
   Distances between the treatment plants and emptying events where then
   compared with linear distances between emptying events and future
   treatment plants in Kinawataka and Nalukolongo. These treatment plants
   are currently planned under the Kampala Sanitation Program and will
   provide two additional discharge locations for emptying service
   providers [20].

3. Results and Discussion

3.1. Overview of Service Providers

   In total, 63 private faecal sludge emptying, collection and transport
   trucks are operating in Kampala, of which 25 are members of the PEA, 37
   of the KPEA, and one remains independent. KCCA, the public service
   provider, had four trucks in operation during the research period.
   These primarily operated within the public sector (e.g., schools,
   markets, public, and communal toilets). Emptying services in
   institutional, industrial, and commercial areas are performed by both
   private and public service providers [12].
   Depending on the truck volume, the trucks are operated by one driver
   and one to two assistants. Faecal sludge is transported either to
   Lubigi or Bugolobi treatment plants for discharge. At the time of the
   research, the discharge fee was USD 2.0–5.6, depending on the truck
   volume. In between service calls, while trucks are waiting, they are
   based at either of the treatment plants (23 at Bugolobi, 44 at Lubigi).
   Private service providers wait at the respective treatment plant for
   customer calls, whereas KCCA operates continuously with a defined list
   of customers to be serviced daily. Manual faecal sludge emptying
   services are available, however, data on the scale of operation is
   lacking [12].
   Private service providers are directly contacted by the customer and
   the fee for emptying services ranges from USD 17–28 per trip, depending
   on factors such as distance, truck volume, presence of solid waste in
   the containment, and density of sludge [12]. The existing truck volumes
   are: 2–3.9 m^3 (23 trucks), 4–5.9 m^3 (28 trucks), 6–7.9 m^3 (3
   trucks), and 8–11 m^3 (13 trucks).
   Private service providers report that factors such as timing of heavy
   rain, monthly pay day, harvest period, due date of school fees, and
   public holidays influence the frequency of emptying requests. However,
   based on NWSC records during the period of this study, none of these
   factors showed an indicative influence. It is possible that they do
   have an effect though, as these factors mainly affect households. In
   previous studies, up to 50% of faecal sludge discharged at treatment is
   from non-household sources, and so these types of household level
   influences may not be observable [23].

3.2. Scale of Operation

   In total, 34 out of 67 trucks operating at the time were equipped with
   GPS data loggers. KCCA trucks were equipped for a five week period,
   with all other trucks were equipped for twelve weeks. During the
   research period, 5’653 emptying events were recorded. The data were
   assumed to be representative of the patterns of service delivery for
   all trucks in the city, as 51% of all trucks that were monitored
   included representative numbers from a range of factors, which could
   affect the spatial distribution of emptying events. This included 56%
   of the trucks based at Bugolobi and 48% based at Lubigi, 64% of trucks
   belonging to the PEA and 38% belonging to the KPEA, and a range of
   operating truck volumes including 56% of 2–3.9 m^3 trucks, 46% of 4–5.9
   m^3 trucks, 100% of 6–7.9 m^3 trucks, and 38% of 8–11 m^3 trucks.
   Additionally, in comparison to NWSC records of discharge events at
   treatment, this study captured 65% of emptying services provided by
   private service providers and 112% by KCCA. Private service providers
   performed an average of 2.1 emptying events per truck per day, whereas
   KCCA trucks performed 5.8 events per truck per day. Reasons for this
   significant difference appear not to be that KCCA is more efficient in
   emptying, but in scheduling emptying events, as drivers are provided
   with a daily schedule and are providing services to containment
   technologies that are readily accessible. This indicates that private
   service providers could also potentially operate at increased capacity
   with more effective planning of emptying schedules, such as proposed
   call centres [27], which could also contribute to an increase in
   overall service delivery.

3.2.1. Spatial Distribution of Emptying Events

   An overview of all recorded emptying events, of which 73% were located
   within Kampala boundaries, 22% in the Greater Kampala Metropolitan
   Area, and 5% outside the Greater Kampala Metropolitan Area is provided
   in Figure 1 (for supplemental report with additional maps available,
   see [28]). Collected faecal sludge is most frequently transported to
   the closest treatment plant to the emptying location. Due to
   urbanisation, population growth and limited unoccupied areas within
   Kampala boundaries, it can be expected that demand for faecal sludge
   emptying services outside Kampala, but within the Greater Kampala
   Metropolitan Area, will continue to increase within the near future.
   This demonstrates the importance of thinking outside of political
   boundaries when planning for faecal sludge management infrastructure
   and emptying service delivery.

3.2.2. Service Coverage in Low-Income Informal Settlements

   As illustrated in Figure 2, 37% of all recorded emptying events were
   located within informal settlements. However, when considering this
   high frequency of emptying events population density should also be
   considered, and it should not be confused with adequate access to
   improved sanitation [29], as 68% of residents of informal settlements
   in Kampala share toilet facilities with an average of 82 users [18].
   The high frequency of emptying events are, therefore, explained by an
   inadequate number of toilet facilities per capita, resulting in overuse
   and rapid filling of containment technologies. The increased population
   density in informal settlements is also a factor for increased demand
   for emptying services, which is not fully captured in these numbers as
   manual emptying is also taking place where access to trucks is not
   feasible. Service provision in these areas could potentially be
   improved by linking manual and mechanical service provision with
   transfer stations.
   Information on volumes and filling rates of containment technologies in
   Kampala is, for the most part, not available [30]. Customers frequently
   do not know volumes of their faecal sludge containment and service
   providers have to estimate based on qualitative assumptions [12]. This
   illustrates the future need for more in-depth quantification and
   characterisation studies for the appropriate planning of faecal sludge
   management and sizing of treatment facilities.

3.2.3. High-Frequency Non-Household Emptying Services

   Of the 1525 (or 37%) recorded emptying events 98 were from customers
   with high-frequency emptying services. These locations were
   non-household sources (e.g., commercial establishments, workers in
   industries, public toilets), which have faecal sludge emptied much more
   frequently than household-level users. It is imperative to consider
   non-household faecal sludge quantities, as Kampala doubles in size
   during the day with people commuting into the city [17]. It can be
   expected that faecal sludge from non-household sources has different
   physico-chemical characteristics due to shorter retention times and
   different inputs to the containment (e.g., kitchen, bathing), which
   highlights the importance of carrying out quantification and
   characterisation on a scale that is relevant to planned infrastructure
   (e.g., city-wide or neighbourhood scale). Faecal sludge is highly
   variable due to factors that range widely at the household level, such
   as soil characteristics, ground water, system inputs, quality of
   construction, type of containment, and it is also not homogenised
   during transport in the sewer as is wastewater [4]. Not taking this
   into account can lead to inappropriate designs and management plans;
   for example, using literature values instead of actual local
   characteristics led to over-design of a treatment plant by 200% over
   capacity [31]. Accurate designs are important to ensure appropriate
   treatment performance, not waste financial resources, which, among
   other factors, contribute to sustainable long-term operation of faecal
   sludge treatment plants [32].

3.2.4. Areas without Service Provision

   As presented in Figure 3, 54.7 km^2, or 31%, of the Kampala area did
   not receive any service provision during this study. To evaluate
   service provision, areas within Central Division that are connected to
   the sewer and non-residential areas were removed, resulting in a total
   adjusted area of 23.6 km^2, or 13%. Obviously, it cannot be
   extrapolated that emptying could never occur in these areas. However,
   identification of urban areas without mechanical emptying service
   provision over a three month period is valuable for a service delivery
   assessment, to identify areas for priority interventions by the
   municipality, and to identify untapped markets that the private sector
   could fill. Parts of informal settlements that were difficult to access
   could be accessed with manual emptiers using semi-mechanised equipment
   (e.g., the Gulper), and mechanical service provision elsewhere [21].

3.2.5. Influence of Population Density on Frequency of Emptying

   Hypothetically, income, type of containment technology, and population
   density could be indicators for levels of service provision. For
   example, in low-income areas, residents are less able to afford
   emptying services, and/or locations are not accessible for trucks
   [7,21]. In areas where unlined pit latrines are the prevailing type of
   containment technology, faecal sludge is typically not serviced by
   mechanical emptying with trucks due to the risk of collapse during
   emptying [20,33]. In Kampala, population density is also an indicator
   of income level and containment technology. To further evaluate service
   provision at the household level in Kampala, the frequency of emptying
   events during this study was normalised to land area and 1000
   population equivalents on a parish level (Equation (1); data for
   analyses in supplementary material, 1000 was selected for ease of
   analysis) as defined by the following four levels of service delivery:
     * Low frequency: Emptying events > 0 < 50/1000 cap × ha
     * Medium frequency: Emptying events ≥ 50 < 200/1000 cap × ha
     * High frequency: Emptying events ≥ 200 < 500/1000 cap × ha
     * Very high frequency: Emptying events ≥ 500/1000 cap × ha

   As shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5, adjusting emptying events for
   population density reveals that areas that have the highest levels of
   service provision were in medium- and high-income areas (Figure 6) and
   these areas also have lower resident population densities. Parishes
   with the lowest levels of service provision were in low- and very
   low-income areas and have higher resident population densities. Even
   though 37% of all emptying events inside the Kampala boundaries were
   recorded in informal settlements, 32% of those were non-household
   sources of faecal sludge that were not included in this analysis. Based
   on this analysis, it appears that household-level users in informal
   settlements are greatly underserved by toilet facilities and also
   mechanical faecal sludge emptying service providers. This is not
   surprising, as the cost for emptying events (USD 17 and USD 28 per
   trip) can be as high as half of the yearly household income in
   low-income areas [12,18]. These results could indicate that a
   significant proportion of accumulated faecal sludge in low-income areas
   ends up directly in the environment, which is in line with estimates of
   up to 75% of excreta in Kampala not being safely managed in very low-
   and low-income areas of Kampala [23]. Policies and regulations need to
   be developed for equitable access to sanitation, beyond just toilet
   facilities that also includes faecal sludge management.

3.3. Optimisation of Faecal Sludge Logistics

   An analysis of spatial GIS data can also be useful for reducing travel
   times and transport costs, thereby reducing overall costs of sanitation
   provision. Route analysis and road network modelling with hypothetical
   data of faecal sludge emptying, collection, and transport is possible
   in regions with well-established road networks; for example, in
   Switzerland [34]. However, this relies on basic assumptions, such as
   consistent speed limits, fuel consumption, truck volumes, containment
   volumes, and reduced idling with increased density. These assumptions
   are simply not viable in dense, urban, low-income cities in Sub-Saharan
   Africa, where fully-functional road networks do not even exist, and
   possible routing changes are not predictable.
   As road network analysis was not considered viable, analysis was
   performed with linear distance as an indication of how much travel
   distances could be reduced with additional treatment plants. Figure 7
   illustrates linear distances between emptying events and present
   location of Lubigi and Bugolobi treatment plants (a) and linear
   distances between emptying events, present location of Lubigi treatment
   plant, and future location of Kinawataka and Nalukolongo treatment
   plants (b). Figure 7a shows all emptying events in this study with
   average linear distance to existing treatment plants, compared to
   Figure 7b that includes the three treatment plants that are planned in
   the Kampala Sanitation Program [20]. The analysis reveals a reduction
   in linear distance from 6.4 km to 5.4 km. As more information on
   infrastructure, daily quantities of faecal sludge produced and
   delivered, and the possibility of transfer stations becomes available,
   this type of analyses could greatly increase the overall efficiency
   when siting treatment plants and transfer stations. For transfer
   stations to be effective in reducing transport costs, it would require
   onsite dewatering and treatment of supernatant, with dewatered sludge
   being transferred to treatment plants. In addition to reducing
   transport times, distances, and costs, it is known that there is an
   economy of scale for the level of centralisation and decentralisation
   of treatment facilities which could also be optimised, in addition to
   strategies to meet growth [35]. However, identifying locations for
   treatment plants and transfer stations is also part of a complex
   decision-making process that in addition to distances includes factors,
   such as planning restrictions, residents’ influence on decision-making,
   and the cost of land [15].
   The use of GIS tools for optimisation of faecal sludge collection and
   transport at city-wide scale provides an opportunity to increase
   sustainability of the planning and decision-making process by
   increasing access to service provision and reducing faecal sludge
   transport times and costs. The method is applicable anywhere, but
   variables need to be adapted to the local situation; for example,
   sufficiently detailed spatial data (e.g., GIS map layers or
   crowd-sourced information). However, the analyses in this study were
   limited to mechanical emptying service providers. To increase the
   benefits for planning of city-wide sanitation service provision, and
   the potential for optimisation, the methodology could be extended to
   include logistics of manual and informal emptying, direct discharges,
   and non-emptiable types of containment.

4. Conclusions

   The benefits of employing GIS analyses as a component of planning
   include:
     * Access to sanitation: Identifying areas that lack adequate access
       to sanitation for priority intervention by local municipalities to
       increase equity of service coverage.
     * Underserved areas: Identifying areas where manual or mechanical
       private entrepreneurs could profitably increase service provision,
       and increase access to faecal sludge management.
     * Future demand: Identifying areas with rapidly growing and high
       population densities with a need for increased service provision.
     * Identify service areas: Locating areas outside of the municipal
       boundaries, which are being served by treatment plants within
       boundaries.
     * Optimise locations: Siting of treatment plants and transfer
       stations to optimise transport distances could greatly reduce
       transport costs and impacts to traffic.
     * Quantification and characterisation: Identifying sources of faecal
       sludge, which could be combined with other tools to increase
       accuracy of quantification and characterisation for appropriate
       design.
     * Existing infrastructure: Optimising usage of existing
       infrastructure.

Abstract

   Recommender systems have gained a lot of popularity due to their large
   adoption in various industries such as entertainment and tourism.
   Numerous research efforts have focused on formulating and advancing
   state-of-the-art of systems that recommend the right set of items to
   the right person. However, these recommender systems are hard to
   compare since the published evaluation results are computed on diverse
   datasets and obtained using different methodologies. In this paper, we
   researched and prototyped an offline evaluation framework called
   Sequeval that is designed to evaluate recommender systems capable of
   suggesting sequences of items. We provide a mathematical definition of
   such sequence-based recommenders, a methodology for performing their
   evaluation, and the implementation details of eight metrics. We report
   the lessons learned using this framework for assessing the performance
   of four baselines and two recommender systems based on Conditional
   Random Fields (CRF) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), considering
   two different datasets. Sequeval is publicly available and it aims to
   become a focal point for researchers and practitioners when
   experimenting with sequence-based recommender systems, providing
   comparable and objective evaluation results. View Full-Text

Abstract

   :
   Concentrations of ambient fine particles (PM[10]: particles with an
   aerodynamic diameter ≤ 10 µm) are still exceeding current air quality
   standards in many European cities. In Munich (Germany), low emission
   zone and transit bans for heavy-duty vehicles were introduced in 2008
   aiming at reduction of traffic emissions contribution to PM[10]. The
   effects of those measures on PM[10] mass concentrations in Munich were
   investigated with a semiparametric regression model for modeling PM[10]
   levels adjusted for time, background pollution, public holidays and
   wind direction. The reduction of PM[10] concentration after the
   introduction of the measures was larger at a traffic monitoring site
   (13.0 %, 19.6 % in summer, and 6.8 % in winter) and smaller in urban
   background (4.5 %, 5.7 % in summer, and 3.2 % in winter). The effect
   was most pronounced on Fridays and on the weekends in summer.

1. Introduction

   In recent years, epidemiological studies have shown consistent
   associations between exposure to air pollution and cardio-respiratory
   morbidity and mortality [1,2,3]. The effects were partially attributed
   to traffic-related air pollutants such as fine particles, diesel soot
   or ultrafine particles in ambient air as well as other indicators of
   road traffic exposures, such as living or working close to major roads
   or nitrogen oxides [4,5,6,7]. Besides other ambient particle sources
   including e.g. industry and domestic heating, traffic emissions are
   supposed to have a significant impact on the local air quality and to
   contribute to the observed adverse health effects on humans.
   In 1999, the European Commission established limit values for PM[10]
   and some other air pollutants in the Air Quality Daughter Directive
   1999/30/EC [8], which was replaced in 2008 by the new Directive
   2008/50/EC on ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe [9]. The
   existing air quality guidelines for PM[10] are currently being exceeded
   at many locations throughout Europe and Germany [10,11,12].
   As traffic emissions are among the main contributors to anthropogenic
   pollutant emissions in the urban air [13], the reduction of traffic
   emissions offers an efficient strategy for reducing PM[10] levels in
   urban air. One widely-used, non-technical measure to meet the policy
   targets for PM[10] is the implementation of Low Emission Zones (LEZs).
   In Germany, a LEZ is a defined area (mostly located around the city
   centre) where the vehicles that enter have to meet certain emissions
   standards. For entering the LEZ all vehicles have to be identified by
   color coded windscreen badges which are directly linked to the
   corresponding stages of European emission standards (Euro 2: red; Euro
   3: yellow; Euro 4: green). Petrol-driven vehicles equipped with a
   catalytic converter are principally assigned to the Euro 4 class and
   will be entitled to a green badge. In the first stage of operation all
   vehicles with a badge (red, yellow or green) are allowed to enter the
   LEZ. In stage 2, the LEZ can be accessed by vehicles displaying a
   yellow or green badge, whereas stage 3 of the LEZ allows access only to
   vehicles with a green badge.
   The first measure aiming reduction of PM[10] concentrations in ambient
   air in Munich was the introduction of a law forbidding transit of
   vehicles heavier than 3.5 tons through the city area on 1 February
   2008. This law forces all trucks without final destination in Munich to
   use the motorway ring A99 round around the city area. As a second
   measure the first stage of the LEZ became operative at 1 October 2008.
   In this stage, all vehicles with Euro 1 (or worse) were no longer
   allowed to enter and drive within the area of the LEZ. From 1 October
   2010 the second stage of the LEZ in Munich became effective; all
   vehicles with Euro 2 (red sticker or without any sticker) are not
   allowed to enter the LEZ. Stage 3 of the Munich LEZ has been in
   operation since 1 October 2012 and only vehicles with green batches are
   allowed within the LEZ.
   Currently, LEZs have been implemented in 13 European countries [14]. In
   Germany, 49 LEZs are in operation or in the planning stages [15]. Some
   local authorities in Germany estimated the expected impact of the LEZ
   on air quality prior to their implementation (mostly by dispersion
   modeling). The predicted reduction of PM[10] mass concentration in
   ambient air, which is currently regulated and therefore the focus of
   our examination, ranges from 2% to 10 % depending on the
   characteristics of the specific LEZ, its valid stage and the number of
   exceptional permissions for cars that fail to meet the required
   emission standards. However, the verifying of the predicted reduction
   of PM[10] levels by analyzing the measured PM[10] mass concentrations
   is difficult, due to large influence of meteorological conditions on
   the PM[10] levels [16].
   Several studies about the benefit of traffic regulation measures in
   European cities were already published. PM[10] and CO levels decreased
   after the introduction of the London congestion charging scheme [17,18]
   and PM[10] and NO[X] were reduced during a seven month test period of
   the congestion tax in Stockholm. Modest reductions in PM[10] and
   PM[2.5]were observed in four Danish cities as a consequence of the
   introduction of a LEZ [19]. Since the implementation of the London LEZ
   strong reductions of the particle number concentration were detected
   [20] and small changes in the PM concentration [21]. Boogaard et al.
   [22] found that local traffic policies were associated with reductions
   in PM[2.5] in five Dutch cities. In spite of the challenges, there have
   already been a few papers analyzing the effects of the German LEZs on
   the improvement of air quality [16,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30]. However,
   they mostly use rather simple (and varying) statistical approaches.
   Because these studies analyze different LEZs using different
   statistical methods, the results are difficult to compare insofar as
   different statistical approaches were used for the analyses.
   In the first study of LEZ impact in Munich, the adjustment for the
   influence of meteorological conditions on PM[10] levels was conducted
   with a reference monitoring station located in a regional background
   area close to the city [25]. A relative reduction of PM[10] levels has
   been seen at almost all involved monitoring sites and the relative
   decrease ranged from 5% up to 12 %. However, this analysis was applied
   on a rather short period and used descriptive statistical analyses
   only. Morfeld et al. [30] analysed the same data set using regression
   analyses for matched observations of subsequent years and have not
   found significant effects of the LEZ.
   In our study, we extended the period under investigation and improved
   the statistical approach of the analysis. We restrict here our analysis
   only on the PM[10] particle fraction. One reason for this restriction
   is that there are no data on other relevant particle characteristics
   (such as PM[2.5], Black Smoke or particle number concentration)
   available for Munich. Secondly, LEZs were introduced in Germany as a
   primary measure for reducing PM[10] and consequently the public debate
   about the effectiveness of LEZs is mainly focused on changes in this
   particle fraction. We compared the PM[10] concentrations before and
   after the LEZ implementation by applying of a semiparametric
   statistical model with first-order autoregressive errors on data in a
   time resolution of one hour. The estimated PM[10] levels were adjusted
   for PM[10] exposure at the reference station, wind direction, season,
   time throughout a week, and public holidays. Two questions were of
   interest: First, we investigated, whether a significant overall
   reduction of PM[10] levels adjusted for possible confounders could be
   detected following the implementation of the measures in Munich and
   whether the effect at the street site differed from the urban
   background site. Second, we examined the seasonal and diurnal variation
   of the air quality changes, which might have originated in the
   variations of the number of vehicles and of the composition of the
   vehicle fleet.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Study Area and Selection of the Monitoring Stations

   The study was conducted in Munich, Germany. In 2011, Munich had a
   population of approximately 1.41 million inhabitants in an area of
   310.4 km^2 and there were approximately 700,000 registered cars [31].
   The LEZ in Munich covers 44 km², which accounts for 14 % of the whole
   city area. However, 32 % of the city population lives in this area
   (Figure 1).

   Ijerph 11 05094 g001
   For our study, we obtained PM[10] data collected at two monitoring
   sites located within the LEZ: one urban background site, Lothstrasse
   (measurement height: 4 m over ground) and one street site,
   Prinzregentenstrasse (measurement height: 2.9 m over ground; distance
   to road: 3 m; 39,000 vehicles/day in 2007–2010) [32,33]. The local
   traffic contributes with 22 % to the PM[10] levels at the measurement
   site Prinzregentenstrasse and to 6 % at the site Lothstrasse [33]. A
   regional background site in the outskirts of the city and outside the
   LEZ in Johanneskirchen was selected as a reference site (measurement
   height: 4 m over ground; distance to road: 5 m). All three monitoring
   stations are operated by the Bavarian Environment Agency (Bayerisches
   Landesamt für Umwelt, Augsburg, Germany) as part of the Bavarian
   Monitoring System for Air Quality (LÜB: Lufthygienisches
   Landesüberwachungssystem Bayern) (Figure 1). The remaining three
   monitoring stations were not involved in the analysis and are not shown
   in Figure 1. Two of them (Luise-Kiesselbach-Platz, Landshuter Allee)
   are located at the border of the LEZ and one (Stachus) were excluded as
   construction and tram track maintenance was conducted between August
   2008 and April 2010 in the vicinity of this monitoring site.

2.2. Study Period and Data

   In our analysis, we compared the PM[10] concentrations measured prior
   to the implementation of any air quality measures (period 1) with the
   PM[10] levels measured after the measures became effective (period 2).
   Data on PM[10] mass concentrations in an hourly time resolution were
   used for the analysis. The analysis period 1 was selected from 1
   February 2006 until 31 January 2008. In the period between 1 February
   2008 and 30 September 2008, only a truck transit ban was effective.
   This period was excluded from the analysis because it was too short to
   draw general conclusions. The examination period 2 (both transit ban
   for heavy-duty vehicles and LEZ in stage 1 were effective) covered the
   rest of the data between 1 October 2008 and 30 September 2010. PM[10]
   records at the Prinzregentenstrasse were only available until 31 June
   2010, because the station was closed. The PM[10] values on 1 January
   were excluded from the analysis for each year due to the traditional
   New Year’s Eve fireworks.
   Hourly measurements of the wind direction in 36 angle categories
   representative for the city of Munich (measured ca. 4 km northwest of
   the inner city of Munich) were obtained from the German National
   Meteorological Service.

2.3. Statistical Analysis

   The urban PM[10] levels were assumed to be mainly driven by the
   following factors: The measurements at the reference station
   represented the regional background pollution level, which was mostly
   not affected by the measures. Therefore, the PM[10] levels of the
   reference station reflected the changes of the PM[10] levels of the
   station of interest owing to meteorological conditions, the background
   PM[10] levels and long term temporal trends in PM[10]. Despite large
   scale effects of the wind direction, which were represented through the
   reference station, local effects of the wind direction occur due to the
   position of the measurement stations in the local vicinity, e.g.
   regarding to nearby factories or park areas.
   Since our data comprise only four years of measurements, long term
   temporal trends at the stations within the LEZ beyond the trends at the
   reference station could not be considered in the model and are of minor
   relevance. However, seasonal variation in PM[10] concentration occurred
   (see Supplemental Material, Figure S1), which possibly may change the
   effect of the measures. Hourly PM[10] levels are subject to daily
   cyclic variation due to heating and also due to traffic; therefore, the
   measures may also affect the temporal pattern of PM[10] levels. Public
   holidays during weekdays may yield deviations from the usual
   concentration levels.
   A semiparametric model with first-order autoregressive errors (refer to
   Clifford et al. [34] for a Bayesian implementation of a similar model
   for ultrafine particle number concentrations) was used to estimate the
   association between air pollution and the introduction of measures:
   log(PM[10x]) = β[0] + β[1] log(PM[10ref]) + β[SM] · I[SM] + β[W] · I[W]
   + β[WM] · I[WM] + f[S](hour) · I[S] + f[SM](hour) · I[SM] + f[W](hour)
   · I[W] + f[WM](hour) · I[WM] + f[wd](wind direction) + β[2](public
   holiday) + ε .
   (1)
   The effects of the corresponding covariates were denoted with β.The
   outcome variable was the logarithmically transformed PM[10] mass
   concentration at an urban station, which is denoted by log(PM[10][x]).
   I[S], I[W,] I[SM], I[WM] denote the indicator function for “summer
   without measures”, “winter without measures”, “summer with measures”
   and ”winter with measures”, respectively. The winter season was defined
   from October to March, the summer season from April to September.
   The following variables were considered as confounding factors:
   logarithmically transformed PM[10] levels at the reference station
   (log(PM[10][ref])), a smooth, cyclic effect based on P-splines with
   maximum four degrees of freedom of the wind direction, f[wd](wind
   direction), and an indicator for public holidays (public holiday).
   Adjusting for the PM[10] measurements at the reference station prevents
   from “regression to the mean” [35], improves the power of the model in
   comparison to the analysis of differences [36] and allows flexible and
   simple adjustments for other confounders. We selected the confounder
   variables by a priori considerations. Since we include an adjustment by
   the reference station with similar temperature and precipitation, we
   did not use these variables in the confounder model. Since wind
   direction has a local effect, which differs from the effect at the
   reference station, we included the variable wind direction in our
   model.
   In addition, the model was adjusted for deterministic seasonal
   components, similar to [37]. The effect of the measures (M) was
   analyzed separately for summer (S) and winter (W) to allow for seasonal
   variability. Daily and daytime-specific deviations were modeled with an
   hourly-resolved weekly season-specific trend, f[S](hour) · I[S],
   f[SM](hour) · I[SM], f[W](hour) · I[W], f[WM](hour) · I[WM] Cyclic
   penalized splines were used as basis functions for a smooth
   nonparametric estimation. Permitting a maximum number of 49 degrees of
   freedom, the model reached enough flexibility to describe the daytime
   dependent variability of the traffic.
   Percentage changes of PM[10] levels were modeled through logarithmic
   concentration levels [37]. In particular, it was suggested that the
   measures, the public holidays and the seasons yielded to percentage
   effects on the PM[10] concentration.
   Note, that the usage of the semiparametric model lessens the problem of
   scale. Furthermore, the highly skewed distribution of the PM[10] mass
   concentration was another reason for using the logarithmic
   transformation.
   Since the measurements are not independent, an autoregressive process
   of order 1 is simultaneously modeled for the error term ε.
   The overall effect of the measures was examined for each of the two
   seasons with a test on the hypotheses whether the effect coefficients
   for winter and summer differ between the periods with and without
   measures:
   H[0] : β[W] = β[WM],β[SM] = 0
   (2)
   Day-specific effects were investigated using an appropriate linear
   combination of the effect coefficients, representing the area between
   the smooth effect with and without measures. The inference for the
   day-specific effects was based on the asymptotic normality of linear
   combinations (for more details see Supplemental Material, “Modelling of
   day specific effects”).
   Statistical calculations were conducted using R [38], version 2.15.3;
   semiparametric models were estimated with the package “mgcv” [39],
   version 1.7-22.

3. Results

3.1. Data Description

   Figure 2 shows the weekly means of PM[10] concentrations at the two
   monitoring sites within the LEZ (Prinzregentenstrasse and Lothstrasse)
   and at the reference site in Johanneskirchen. Weekly means were chosen
   to display the trend of PM[10] levels for reasons of clarity and
   reducing the point-to-point variation.

   The PM[10] concentrations were higher in the winter season and lower in
   the summer season. In particular, elevated PM[10] levels were observed
   between January and March. The means of the unadjusted PM[10] mass
   concentrations before and after the implementation of measures are
   given in Table 1.
   At both urban stations, a decrease of PM[10] in period 2 (compared to
   period 1) was observed. The decrease at Prinzregentenstrasse (−14.0% in
   summer, −1.9% in winter) was larger in summer and similar in winter as
   at Lothstrasse (−2.3% in summer, −2.5% in winter). At the reference
   station in Johanneskirchen, also differences between the two periods
   were detected (−2.1% in summer, −0.8% in winter). The PM[10]
   concentration was on average 27.6% at Prinzregentenstrasse and 12.5% at
   Lothstrasse higher (median percentage difference) than at the reference
   station. While considering mere mean concentrations the impact of
   confounding factors like meteorological conditions were disregarded;
   the regression analysis in section 3.2 allowed for these confounders.
   The Spearman correlation coefficients between the hourly means of
   PM[10]concentration measured at the three monitoring sites were high
   and ranged from 0.69 to 0.88, the correlations between the daily
   averages were even slightly stronger (ranged from 0.83 to 0.96). The
   hourly PM[10] concentrations at the three monitoring sites were highly
   autocorrelated with autocorrelation coefficients between 0.87 and 0.92.
   The temporal trend of the annual means observed at the urban background
   site Lothstrasse and the regional background site (as the reference
   site) in Johanneskirchen was very similar. It indicates that both sites
   were not influenced by any local sources of PM. Even more, the PM[10]
   values obtained at the measurement site in Johanneskirchen were very
   similar and strong correlated with the PM[10] values observed at a
   regional background site located at the campus of the Bavarian Agency
   for Environmental Protection in Augsburg, Germany (about 90 km linear
   distance from Johanneskirchen).

3.2. Statistical Modeling

   According to equation (1), the PM[10] concentrations at a specific
   monitoring site were calculated for “summer without measures” and
   “winter without measures” as well as “summer with measures” and “winter
   with measures”, respectively. In Table 2, the relative differences
   between the periods with and without measures are shown for
   Prinzregentenstrasse (street site) and Lothstrasse (urban background
   site), and indicated separately for the summer and winter season.

   Note: adjusted for exposure at the reference station, wind direction,
   day of the week, time of the day and public holidays.
   The effects of the air quality measures differ at the two measurement
   stations as well as between the seasons. A stronger reduction in PM[10]
   mass concentrations was observed at the street site; on average 19.6%
   (5.4 µg/m^3, p-value: <0.001) in summer and 6.8% (2.1 µg/m^3, p-value:
   <0.001) in winter, respectively. At the urban background site
   Lothstrasse smaller decreases were estimated: 5.73% (1.1 µg/m^3,
   p-value: <0.001) in summer and 3.18% (0.7 µg/m^3, p-value: <0.003) in
   winter. If we had not have determined separate effects for the two
   seasons, the reduction of the PM[10] concentration by the measures at
   Prinzregentenstrasse would have been estimated with 13.0% (p-value:
   <0.001) and with 4.5%; (p-value: <0.001) at Lothstrasse.
   Figure 3 shows the temporal patterns of the modeled PM[10]
   concentrations at Prinzregentenstrasse and Lothstrasse for the periods
   with and without measures (adjusted for PM[10] concentration at the
   reference station, wind direction and public holidays). Temporal
   variability of PM[10] levels occurred between the seasons, the weekdays
   and times of day. The concentrations were higher in the winter months.
   The morning and afternoon rush hour peaks during the working days were
   clearly visible especially at Prinzregentenstrasse. The morning peak in
   the summer months was more clearly separated from the afternoon peak as
   in the winter season. The efficiency of the measures depended on the
   time of the day (see also Supplemental Material, Figure S2) and
   followed a diurnal pattern. Due to the implemented measures the PM[10]
   burden was stronger reduced during hours with higher relative and
   absolute PM[10] mass concentration, i.e. between the morning and
   afternoon rush hour peaks. The rush hour peaks themselves were reduced
   and there seemed to be lesser spillover from the morning to the
   afternoon. Furthermore, the improving of air quality during the nights
   on workdays was faster at the street site. The effect of the measures
   vanishes during night-time of the first days of the working week.
   The mean daily effects of both measures (stratified by season and week
   day) are shown in Figure 4 for each day of the week separately. In the
   summer season, the effect of the measures for each day of the week was
   at the street site stronger than in winter, whereas this tendency is
   not observed at the background site. However, at both sites the
   strongest effects were observed on Fridays (−25.0% in summer and −16.4%
   in winter at street site, −8.2% in summer and −6.1% in winter at the
   background site) and Saturdays (−25.9% in summer at street site, −11.4%
   in summer and −5.3% in winter at the background site). On Sunday a
   strong seasonal dependency of the effect was observed: the measures
   were only effective in summer.
   The effects of the linearly modeled confounding covariates are
   displayed in Supplemental Material, Table S1. The logarithmic values of
   the reference station had a significant, additive effect of log(1.381)
   = 0.323 at Prinzregentenstrasse and log(1.972) = 0.679 at Lothstrasse.
   Public holidays led to a reduction of PM[10] levels in the ambient air
   by approximately 13%. Since the estimated autocorrelation coefficient
   was relatively high (Prinzregentenstrasse: ρ = 0.70, Lothstrasse: ρ =
   0.54), the bigger part of the autocorrelation of the PM[10]
   measurements could not be explained through the inclusion of the smooth
   components in the predictor. The model for the measurements at
   Prinzregentenstrasse explained 74.5% of the variability in the data and
   the model for the Lothstrasse 83.0%.
   The shape of the smooth effect of wind direction indicates decreased
   PM[10] levels, if the wind blew from the South or West at Lothstrasse
   and if the wind blew from North or East at Prinzregentenstrasse (data
   not shown). We focused our analysis on PM[10], because the reason for
   the establishment of the LEZ exceeded PM[10] limit values.

4. Discussion

4.1. Impact of the Measures on PM[10] Mass Concentration

   We investigated whether changes in PM[10] levels after the introduction
   of a truck transit ban through the city area and the implementation of
   the first stage of the LEZ in Munich could be detected by analysis of
   emission data on PM[10] mass concentration collected at an urban
   background and a street monitoring site. The comparison of the PM[10]
   mass concentrations (adjusted for exposure at the reference station,
   wind direction, day of the week, time of the day and public holidays
   and calculated separately for summer and winter seasons in a
   semiparametric model with first-order autoregressive errors) showed a
   large relative decrease of PM[10] levels at the street site (13.0%,
   p-value: <0.001), whereas the relative decrease observed at the urban
   background monitoring site was smaller (4.5%, p-value: <0.001). The
   decrease of PM[10] mass concentration predicted in Munich by dispersion
   modeling ranges between 2% and 10 % depending on the monitoring sites
   and the active stage of the LEZ [40]. The maximal reduction (up to 10
   %) was predicted only for the third stage of the LEZ. The changes of
   PM[10] concentrations detected at the street site in our study are
   larger than the reductions predicted a priori and are also larger than
   those observed in the most other German cities [16,23,24,26,27,28,29].
   In general, the implementation of LEZ could influence the composition
   of the car fleet as well as the traffic intensity. The percentage of
   registered vehicles without any badge (Euro 1 or less) decreased during
   the time period 2007–2010 from 9.2% to 2.5% for passenger cars and from
   31.5% to 24.1% for trucks, respectively. In the same time the
   percentage of vehicles with green badge increased from 78.4% to 89.6%
   for passenger cars and from 19.0% to 36.1% for trucks, respectively.
   Those changes are especially pronounced between the years 2007 and
   2008, it means immediately before the implementation of the LEZ in
   Munich [41]. Such an extraordinary modernization of vehicle fleet in
   the city towards low-emission cars was reported also for Berlin [28].
   Note that there is only information about the in Munich registered
   vehicles; no such information is available about the car fleet
   composition in flowing traffic in the city. Regarding the flowing
   traffic it can be assumed that the older vehicles are less often in use
   compared to the newer vehicles.
   For the dispersion modelling, it was assumed that the traffic intensity
   remained constant over the time period 2007–2010. However, the analyses
   presented here are not only considering the impact of the LEZ alone,
   but also the additional impact of the transit ban for all trucks. The
   transit ban for trucks could affect the PM[10] levels even to a larger
   extent than the LEZ, which operated in the analyzed period in the first
   stage only. It leads not solely to a reduction of particles emitted by
   vehicle exhaust, but also to a reduction of particles originated from
   tyre and brake wear or dust re-suspension. Due to the ban on driving
   for trucks on Sunday, the effect for Sunday can be directly ascribed to
   the implementation of the LEZ. A similar pattern was found for
   Saturday, but only at Prinzregentenstrasse. This lead us to the
   assumption that in winter, the vehicle fleet on weekends in the city
   and on Sundays in the urban background was the same before and after
   the introduction of the LEZ, whereas this was not the case during the
   summer season.
   In the previous study estimating the LEZ impact in Munich, a slightly
   weaker effect of 12.3% relative reduction of PM[10] mass concentration
   at Prinzregentenstrasse was found [25]. The analysis was based on the
   comparison of relative PM[10] concentration changes by a reference
   station. However, such analysis of the quotient between the specific
   monitoring station and the reference station neglects the uncertainty
   of the measurements at the reference station. Further regression
   analyses on the ratio as used in the previous study revealed a
   comparably poor model fit (data not shown). This is also denoted by the
   strong deviation of the estimation of the intercept from 1 in our
   analysis. For comparison, we also analyzed the same period as described
   in Cyrys et al. [25] by use of the model applied in our study. We only
   found negligible (statistically insignificant) changes of the PM[10]
   mass concentration (Prinzregenstrasse −1.05%, p-value: 0.855;
   Lothstrasse: 2.42%, p-value: 0.499), as it was similarly found by
   Morfeld et al. [30]. For further comparisons of the approach used in
   our study with other modelling approaches we refer to the “comparison
   of different modeling approaches” section in the Supplemental Material.
   The results of our study are not directly comparable to the results
   obtained for other measures of traffic reduction, which were already
   introduced in some European cities. We analyzed here the common effect
   of the implementation of LEZ and transit ban for trucks in Munich and
   we are aware that such combination is not that common. Even if we might
   be able to evaluate the effects of the LEZ and transit ban for trucks
   separately, the comparison with other cites might remain difficult, as
   the regulations and areas of LEZ’s differ from city to city. The
   following discussion should compare rather roughly the range of the
   effects observed for different measures across Europe. Several studies
   analyzed the impact of congestion charging in London [17,18,42].
   Atkinson et al. [17] observed reductions in PM[10] only at the
   background monitor. The study conducted by Beevers and Carslaw [18]
   indicated that NO[x] and PM[10] emissions have been reduced by about
   12% in the charging zone, whereas the study of Tonne et al. [42] showed
   that the congestion charge schema led to only modest reductions in air
   pollutant concentrations across Greater London, but greater reductions
   in the charging zone. Ellison et al. [21] found that the LEZ in London
   had a significant effect on the composition of the vehicle fleet in
   London and reduced the PM[10] concentrations.
   Johansson and colleagues [43] assessed the effect of traffic congestion
   in Stockholm and concluded that the annual average NO[x] and PM[10]
   concentrations along the most densely trafficked streets would be lower
   by up to 12% and 7%, respectively. Note that the effects in the studies
   of Beevers and Carslaw [18], Tonne et al. [42] and Johansson et al.
   [43] were analyzed by dispersion modelling combined with regression
   calculation and were not verified by air quality measurements. PM[2.5]
   concentrations in Copenhagen were reduced by 5% after the introduction
   of the LEZ [19]. Unadjusted mean pollutants concentrations were lower
   after the implementation of the LEZ in five Dutch cities; the reduction
   in PM[2.5] levels was larger at urban streets (31%) than in the
   suburban background (20%) [22].
   The public debate is often focused solely on PM[10] concentrations (as
   this parameter is currently regulated) without taking into account that
   only the toxic fraction of PM[10] causes adverse human health effects
   [2,3,16]. Due to combustion processes particles originating from
   traffic exhibit a higher toxicity than particles from other sources;
   especially diesel-engine vehicles, which produce about 12% of the mean
   PM[10] exposure of the German population [44], emit these more toxic
   particles.
   Hence, the effectiveness of LEZ could be analyzed more precisely if
   Black Smoke (as marker for diesel soot) or the organic fraction of
   particles would be measured in ambient air instead of total PM[10]
   concentration [16]. Unfortunately, in Germany no routine measurements
   of Black Smoke concentrations in ambient air are conducted. Quadir and
   colleagues [45] reported recently significant lower concentrations for
   elemental carbon and some of particulate organic compounds after the
   introduction of the LEZ in Munich (the data were collected during
   special monitoring campaigns and not routinely by the monitoring
   network). Source apportionment analysis showed a reduction of traffic
   factor contribution by 60% after the implementation of the LEZ [45].
   Also in Berlin the concentration of soot particles decreased 2010 by
   52% compared with 2007 [29]. As climatic conditions in the years
   2008–2010 were adverse when compared to 2007, the authors attribute
   these results to the reduced traffic soot emissions. Currently, a
   debate about the pollution through PM[2.5] emerges, but the data
   material is insufficient because the monitoring of PM[2.5] is only at
   its early stages.
   In addition to dispersion modelling, estimating the expected changes of
   PM[10] mass concentration in the ambient air, our analysis evaluates
   the effects of the measures by analysis of the measured PM[10] values.
   However, the limitation of this strategy is, that also long-term
   changes of PM[10], which could not be explained by the included
   predictors, especially by the PM[10] levels of the reference station
   (for example changes in heating habits), are completely attributed to
   the LEZ effect.

4.2. Seasonal and Diurnal Variation of the Changes in PM[10] Levels

   The second objective of this study was the examination of the seasonal
   and diurnal variation of the detected air quality improvements. The
   extent of the PM[10] reduction at the background sites was largely
   similar in both seasons. In the urban background, exhaust particles
   represent a smaller fraction of fine particles compared to street site
   and the composition of particles varies less between winter and summer.
   On the contrary the difference between the two seasons was more
   pronounced at the street site, where the overall reduction of PM[10]
   mass concentrations was considerable larger as at the background site.
   At this site, the reduction of PM[10] levels due to the measures was
   larger during the summer season and smaller during the winter season.
   In winter, additional particle sources (such as domestic heating, wood
   combustion or combustion of other fossil fuels) contribute
   significantly to the PM[10] mass concentrations in the ambient air.
   Also the contribution of re-suspended dust to fine particles
   concentration in the ambient air increases in winter due to the
   application of road salt for deicing. In addition, the generation of
   secondary aerosols such as nitrate or sulfate is more intensive in
   winter. Consequently, exhaust particles represent a smaller fraction of
   the fine particles in winter than in summer. Therefore, the measures
   regulating only the exhaust particles became less effective in the
   winter period. In addition, adverse meteorological conditions leading
   to increased PM[10] levels from local mobile as well as stationary
   sources are occurring more frequently in the winter season. Our
   analysis suggests that in such episodes the influence of the
   implemented measures regulating the car exhaust is limited and that air
   quality is dominated by other unaffected mobile and stationary sources.
   The reduced rush hour peaks may indicate that a larger proportion of
   old cars no longer accessed the city during midday. Alternatively, the
   contribution of aged particles from the morning rush hours during day
   and night time might be shifted due to the reduction in diesel
   particles. Further, the temporal varying effect of the measures could
   be caused by the same reason as the differences between winter and
   summer season. One has to keep in mind that the morning and afternoon
   rush hour peaks seem to be more separated in summer not due to
   differences in traffic flow between summer and winter, but as a result
   of the combination of increased traffic intensity and increased solar
   radiation in summer.

5. Conclusions

   In our study we evaluated the effectiveness of two measures (a truck
   transit ban through the city area and implementation of LEZ) on the
   reduction of PM[10] mass concentrations in the ambient air in Munich,
   Germany. The analysis of the routinely collected PM[10] mass
   concentrations data by a semiparametric regression model showed
   statistically significant reduction of PM[10] levels at a monitoring
   site located in the direct vicinity of a highly frequented road and to
   a lesser extent at an monitoring site located in the urban background.
   The statistical regression modeling was essential to identify the size
   of the effect. The magnitude of the effect at the street site was
   larger in summer season; smaller seasonal variation was observed at the
   urban background site. In general, the magnitude of the effect depends
   on day of the week, time of the day and location of the monitoring
   site.
   Our analysis indicates that the assessment of the impact of measures
   aiming improvement of air quality in urban air could be conducted by
   use of routinely collected PM[10] data. However, as the expected
   reduction of PM[10] concentration after implementation of LEZ is in
   order of about 10%, the evaluation of this measure by PM[10] data
   remains difficult; other particulate variables, such as PM[2.5], Black
   Smoke, or particulate organic compounds are recommended for such
   evaluation.

Abstract

   The majority of residents in low- and middle-income countries are
   served by onsite sanitation. Equitable access to sanitation, including
   emptying, collection, and transport services for the accumulation of
   faecal sludge remains a major challenge. Comprehensive information on
   service coverage by mechanical faecal sludge emptying service providers
   is lacking. The purpose of this study is to analyse the spatial
   distribution of service coverage and identify areas without faecal
   sludge emptying services in Kampala, Uganda. The study uses GIS
   (geographic information systems) as a tool to analyse real-time data of
   service providers based on GPS (global positioning system) units that
   were installed in a representative number of trucks. Of the total
   recorded 5653 emptying events, 27% were located outside Kampala city
   boundaries. Of those within Kampala city boundaries, 37% were
   classified as non-household customers. Areas without service provision
   accounted for 13% of the total area. Service provision normalised by
   population density revealed much greater service provision in medium-
   and high-income areas than low- and very low-income areas. The employed
   method provides a powerful tool to optimise faecal sludge management on
   a city-wide scale by increasing sustainability of the planning and
   decision-making process, increasing access to service provision and
   reducing faecal sludge transport times and costs. View Full-Text

   Since 2012, the Italian Ministry of Health has recommended to improve
   the surveillance of adverse events following the
   measles-mumps-rubella-varicella (MMRV) tetravalent vaccine that was
   provided in the official immunization schedule of some Italian regions
   for children during the second year of life. This recommendation was
   based on data from some surveys that showed an additional risk of
   seizure following the administration of this vaccine. Responding to the
   Ministry commitment, the Puglia Region launched, from May 2017 to
   November 2018, a post-marketing active surveillance program of adverse
   events following MMRV immunization (AEFIs). Immunized children (second
   year of life) were enrolled on a voluntary basis, AEFIs diaries were
   used, and their parents were interviewed 25 days after the
   immunization. There were 2540 children enrolled; 2149/2540 (84.6%)
   completed the post-vaccination follow-up. Of these, 992 AEFIs were
   registered with a reporting rate of 46.2 × 100 doses: 883/992 (89.0%)
   AEFIs were not serious, while 109/992 (11.0%) were serious. For serious
   AEFIs, the evaluation of causality assessment was performed using the
   algorithm proposed by the World Health Organisation (WHO): 82/109
   consistent causal associations to MMRV immunization were detected
   (reporting rate of consistent AEFIs: 3.8 × 100 follow-up). All serious
   AEFIs consistently associated with immunization resulted completely
   resolved at the follow-up. The reporting rate of seizure consistently
   associated with immunization was 0.05 × 100, lower than data previous
   published in the literature that did not report the causality
   assessment. Because no emerging signals were detected, our data from
   the active surveillance program confirmed the safety profile of the
   MMRV vaccine. Full article

   The activation of halogen bonding by the substitution of the
   pentafluoro-λ^6-sulfanyl (SF[5]) group was studied using a series of
   SF[5]-substituted iodobenzenes. The simulated electrostatic potential
   values of SF[5]-substituted iodobenzenes, the ab initio molecular
   orbital calculations of intermolecular interactions of
   SF[5]-substituted iodobenzenes with pyridine, and the ^13C-NMR
   titration experiments of SF[5]-substituted iodobenzenes in the presence
   of pyridine or tetra (n-butyl) ammonium chloride (TBAC) indicated the
   obvious activation of halogen bonding, although this was highly
   dependent on the position of SF[5]-substitution on the benzene ring. It
   was found that 3,5-bis-SF[5]-iodobenzene was the most effective halogen
   bond donor, followed by o-SF[5]-substituted iodobenzene, while the m-
   and p-SF[5] substitutions did not activate the halogen bonding of
   iodobenzenes. The similar ortho-effect was also confirmed by studies
   using a series of nitro (NO[2])-substituted iodobenzenes. These
   observations are in good agreement with the corresponding Mulliken
   charge of iodine. The 2:1 halogen bonding complex of
   3,5-bis-SF[5]-iodobenzene and 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) was
   also confirmed. Since SF[5]-containing compounds have emerged as
   promising novel pharmaceutical and agrochemical candidates, the
   3,5-bis-SF[5]-iodobenzene unit may be an attractive fragment of
   rational drug design capable of halogen bonding with biomolecules. Full

   Background and Objectives: Diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HT)
   are characterized by cell damage caused by inflammatory and metabolic
   mechanisms induced by alteration in reduction-oxidative status. Serum
   advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) are new markers of protein
   damage induced by oxidative stress. We evaluated serum levels of AOPP
   in a cohort of patients with DM and HT, with or without renal
   complications, compared with a control healthy population. Materials
   and Methods: The study group comprised of 62 patients with type 2 DM
   and 56 with HT. The 62 patients affected by DM were further
   distinguished in 24 subjects without renal impairment, 18 with diabetic
   nephropathy (DN), 20 with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 2–3
   secondary to DN. The subgroup of 56 patients with primary HT comprised
   26 subjects without renal complications and 30 with CKD (stage 2–3)
   secondary to HT. Thirty healthy controls, matched for age and sex, were
   recruited among blood donors. Results: Increased AOPP levels were found
   in DM patients compared with healthy subjects, although not
   significantly. This index was higher and more significant in patients
   with DN and CKD secondary to DN than in DM patients without nephropathy
   (p < 0.05) or controls (p < 0.0001). Patients with HT and with kidney
   impairment secondary to HT also had significantly higher AOPP serum
   levels than controls (p < 0.01 and p < 0.0001, respectively). There
   were no significant differences in mean AOPP levels among DM and HT
   patients. Conclusion: Our study showed that oxidative stress was higher
   in diabetic or hypertensive subjects than in healthy controls and, in
   particular, it appeared to be more severe in patients with renal
   complications. We suggest that the assessment of AOPP in diabetic and
   hypertensive patients may be important to predict the onset of renal
   failure and to open a new perspective on the adoption of antioxidant
   molecules to prevent CKD in those settings. Full article

   Helicobacter pylori infection is a WHO class 1 carcinogenic factor of
   gastric adenocarcinoma. In the past decades, many studies have
   demonstrated the increasing trend of antibiotic resistance and pointed
   out the necessity of new effective treatment. This study was aimed at
   identifying phytochemicals that can inhibit H. pylori and possibly
   serve as adjuvant treatments. Here, in silico molecular docking and
   drug-like properties analyses were performed to identify potential
   inhibitors of urease, shikimate kinase and aspartate-semialdehyde
   dehydrogenase. These three enzymes are targets of the treatment of H.
   pylori. Susceptibility and synergistic testing were performed on the
   selected phytochemicals and the positive control antibiotic,
   amoxicillin. The in-silico study revealed that oroxindin, rosmarinic
   acid and verbascoside are inhibitors of urease, shikimate kinase and
   aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase, respectively, in which, oroxindin
   has the highest potency against H. pylori, indicated by a minimum
   inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 50 μg/mL. A combination of
   oroxindin and amoxicillin demonstrated additive effects against H.
   pylori, as indicated by a fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC)
   value of 0.75. This study identified phytochemicals that deserve
   further investigation for the development of adjuvant therapeutic
   agents to current antibiotics against H. pylori. Full article

   Background: Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) is a binary approach
   to cancer therapy that requires accumulation of boron atoms
   preferentially in tumour cells. This can be achieved by using
   nanoparticles as boron carriers and taking advantage of the enhanced
   permeability and retention (EPR) effect. Here, we present the
   preparation and characterization of size and shape-tuned gold NPs
   (AuNPs) stabilised with polyethylene glycol (PEG) and functionalized
   with the boron-rich anion cobalt bis(dicarbollide), commonly known as
   COSAN. The resulting NPs were radiolabelled with ^124I both at the core
   and the shell, and were evaluated in vivo in a mouse model of human
   fibrosarcoma (HT1080 cells) using positron emission tomography (PET).
   Methods: The thiolated COSAN derivatives for subsequent attachment to
   the gold surface were synthesized by reaction of COSAN with
   tetrahydropyran (THP) followed by ring opening using potassium
   thioacetate (KSAc). Iodination on one of the boron atoms of the cluster
   was also carried out to enable subsequent radiolabelling of the boron
   cage. AuNPs grafted with mPEG-SH (5 Kda) and thiolated COSAN were
   prepared by ligand displacement. Radiolabelling was carried out both at
   the shell (isotopic exchange) and at the core (anionic absorption) of
   the NPs using ^124I to enable PET imaging. Results: Stable gold
   nanoparticles simultaneously functionalised with PEG and COSAN
   ([email protected][4]^−) with hydrodynamic diameter of 37.8 ± 0.5 nm,
   core diameter of 19.2 ± 1.4 nm and ξ-potential of −18.0 ± 0.7 mV were
   obtained. The presence of the COSAN on the surface of the NPs was
   confirmed by Raman Spectroscopy and UV-Vis spectrophotometry.
   [email protected][4]^− could be efficiently labelled with ^124I both at
   the core and the shell. Biodistribution studies in a xenograft mouse
   model of human fibrosarcoma showed major accumulation in liver, lungs
   and spleen, and poor accumulation in the tumour. The dual labelling
   approach confirmed the in vivo stability of the [email protected][4]^−.
   Conclusions: PEG stabilized, COSAN-functionalised AuNPs could be
   synthesized, radiolabelled and evaluated in vivo using PET. The low
   tumour accumulation in the animal model assayed points to the need of
   tuning the size and geometry of the gold core for future studies. Full

   The efficacy of radiosurgery for neurofibromatosis type 2
   (NF2)-associated vestibular schwannoma (VS) remains debatable. We
   retrospectively analyzed radiosurgical outcomes for NF2-associated VS
   compared to sporadic VS using our database of 422 consecutive VS
   patients. Twenty-five patients with 30 NF2-associated VSs with a mean
   follow-up of 121 months were identified. NF2-associated VSs exhibited
   excellent tumor control (10-year cumulative rate, 92% vs. 92% in
   sporadic VSs; p = 0.945) and worse overall survival (73% vs. 97%; p =
   0.005), mainly due to tumor progression other than the treated VSs. The
   presence of NF2 was not associated with failed tumor control via
   multivariate Cox proportional hazard analyses. No difference in
   radiation-induced adverse events (RAEs) was confirmed between cohorts,
   and prescription dose (hazard ratio 8.30, 95% confidence interval
   3.19–21.62, p < 0.001) was confirmed as a risk for cranial nerve
   injuries via multivariate analysis. Further analysis after propensity
   score matching using age, volume, and sex as covariates showed that
   NF2-associated VSs exhibited excellent local control (100% vs. 93%; p =
   0.240) and worse overall survival (67% vs. 100%; p = 0.002) with no
   significant difference in RAEs. Excellent long-term tumor control and
   minimal invasiveness may make radiosurgery a favorable therapeutic
   option for NF2 patients with small to medium VS, preferably with
   non-functional hearing or deafness in combination with postoperative
   tumor growth or progressive non-operated tumors, or with functional
   hearing by patients’ wish. Full article

   Celecoxib (CEL) Nanocrystalline Solid Dispersion (CEL_NCSD) was
   generated by spray drying CEL, mannitol (MAN) and sodium lauryl sulfate
   (SLS) from a solvent mixture of methanol, acetone and water. The
   purpose of the work was to determine the size of CEL nanocrystals,
   investigate agglomeration and inspect dissolution of CEL_NCSD. Size
   determination was challenging as CEL nanocrystals are embedded in the
   matrix of MAN. Firstly, neat CEL_NCSD was analyzed using Scherrer
   equation. Secondly, MAN was dissolved in an aqueous stabilizer medium
   to selectively measure the size of CEL nanocrystals. Raman Spectra
   captured in Morphologi G3-ID confirmed the presence of CEL-only
   particles in the media. This dispersion gave D[90] values of 882 ±
   170.34 nm in Zetasizer. Discriminatory dissolution studies confirmed
   total release of 34.61 ± 1.59%, 47.42 ± 0.24%, and 44.61 ± 1.11% at 120
   min from a microsuspension (size 3 µm), a nanosuspension (media milled;
   size 660 nm) and CEL_NCSD, respectively. The dissolution profile of
   CEL_NCSD was similar to that of a nanosuspension (f2 72.24) instead of
   a coarse microsuspension. Thus, the present study revealed that
   optimized sample preparation is critical for the size determination of
   embedded drug nanocrystals in NCSD. Further, a discriminatory
   dissolution study substantiated that the size of CEL nanocrystals in
   CEL_NCSD is well below 1000 nm, thus showing a size-dependent improved
   dissolution profile. Full article

   The detection of shedded fibers in effluents from textile washing has
   attracted much attention due to its reported contribution to
   microplastic pollution. Commonly used analytical methods for fiber
   detection in liquids are based on filtration with subsequent
   microscopic analysis and/or gravimetric weighing. These approaches are
   time-consuming and prone to errors. In this study, an approach based on
   dynamic image analysis was applied in order to set up an efficient
   method to analyze fibers in effluents from washing processes. In an
   initial validation step, reliable information on the counts of fibers
   and the morphological characteristics were confirmed. For wastewaters
   from polyester-cotton blends, the chemical nature of the fiber debris
   (natural vs. synthetic origin) was determined by combining the dynamic
   image analysis with a chemical pre-treatment. In this study, dynamic
   image analysis was revealed as a rapid, non-destructive, precise, and
   reliable technology for the characterization and quantification of the
   fiber debris, offering a promising approach for fiber analysis in
   liquids. Full article

   In recent years, liver injury induced by Traditional Chinese Medicines
   (TCMs) has gained increasing attention worldwide. Assessing the
   hepatotoxicity of compounds in TCMs is essential and inevitable for
   both doctors and regulatory agencies. However, there has been no
   effective method to screen the hepatotoxic ingredients in TCMs
   available until now. In the present study, we initially built a large
   scale dataset of drug-induced liver injuries (DILIs). Then, 13 types of
   molecular fingerprints/descriptors and eight machine learning
   algorithms were utilized to develop single classifiers for DILI, which
   resulted in 5416 single classifiers. Next, the NaiveBayes algorithm was
   adopted to integrate the best single classifier of each machine
   learning algorithm, by which we attempted to build a combined
   classifier. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the
   curve of the combined classifier were 72.798, 0.732, 0.724, and 0.793,
   respectively. Compared to several prior studies, the combined
   classifier provided better performance both in cross validation and
   external validation. In our prior study, we developed a
   herb-hepatotoxic ingredient network and a herb-induced liver injury
   (HILI) dataset based on pre-clinical evidence published in the
   scientific literature. Herein, by combining that and the combined
   classifier developed in this work, we proposed the first instance of a
   computational toxicology to screen the hepatotoxic ingredients in TCMs.
   Then Polygonum multiflorum Thunb (PmT) was used as a case to
   investigate the reliability of the approach proposed. Consequently, a
   total of 25 ingredients in PmT were identified as hepatotoxicants. The
   results were highly consistent with records in the literature,
   indicating that our computational toxicology approach is reliable and
   effective for the screening of hepatotoxic ingredients in Pmt. The
   combined classifier developed in this work can be used to assess the
   hepatotoxic risk of both natural compounds and synthetic drugs. The
   computational toxicology approach presented in this work will assist
   with screening the hepatotoxic ingredients in TCMs, which will further
   lay the foundation for exploring the hepatotoxic mechanisms of TCMs. In
   addition, the method proposed in this work can be applied to research
   focused on other adverse effects of TCMs/synthetic drugs. Full article

   Diet plays a decisive role in heart physiology, with lipids having
   especial importance in pathology prevention and development. This study
   aimed to investigate how dietary lipids varying in lipid profile
   (virgin olive oil, sunflower oil or fish oil) affected the heart of
   rats during aging. Heart histopathology, mitochondrial morphometry, and
   oxidative status were assessed. Typical histopathological features
   associated with aging, such as valvular lesions, endomyocardical
   hyperplasia, or papillary muscle calcification, were found at a low
   extent in all the experimental groups. The most relevant finding was
   that inflammation registered by fish oil group was lower compared to
   the other treatments. At the ultrastructural level, heart mitochondrial
   area, perimeter, and aspect ratio were higher in fish oil-fed rats than
   in those fed on sunflower oil. Concerning oxidative stress markers,
   there were differences only in coenzyme Q levels and catalase activity,
   lower in sunflower oil-fed animals compared with those fed on fish oil.
   In summary, dietary intake for a long period on dietary fats with
   different fatty acids profile led to differences in some aspects
   associated with the aging process at the heart. Fish oil seems to be
   the fat most protective of heart during aging. Full article

   Surfaces covered with layers of ultrathin nanoantenna structures—so
   called metasurfaces have recently been proven capable of completely
   controlling phase of light. Metalenses have emerged from the advance in
   the development of metasurfaces providing a new basis for recasting
   traditional lenses into thin, planar optical components capable of
   focusing light. The lens made of arrays of plasmonic gold nanorods were
   fabricated on a glass substrate by using electron beam lithography. A
   1064 nm laser was used to create a high intensity circularly polarized
   light focal spot through metalens of focal length 800 µm, N.A. = 0.6
   fabricated based on Pancharatnam-Berry phase principle. We demonstrated
   that optical rotation of birefringent nematic liquid crystal droplets
   trapped in the laser beam was possible through this metalens. The
   rotation of birefringent droplets convinced that the optical trap
   possesses strong enough angular momentum of light from radiation of
   each nanostructure acting like a local half waveplate and introducing
   an orientation-dependent phase to light. Here, we show the success in
   creating a miniaturized and robust metalens based optical tweezers
   system capable of rotating liquid crystals droplets to imitate an
   optical motor for future lab-on-a-chip applications. Full article

   The Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) has reported many
   cases of different UV curing inks components in foodstuffs during the
   last few years. These contaminants reach foodstuffs mainly by set-off,
   their principal migration mechanism from the package. Under this
   premise, this work has tried to characterize the process of migration
   of two common UV ink components: a photoinitiator
   (4-Methylbenzophenone) and a coinitiator (Ethyl-4-(dimethylamino)
   benzoate), from the most common plastic material used in food packaging
   low-density polyethylene (LDPE) into six different food simulants. The
   migration kinetics tests were performed at four different common
   storage temperatures, obtaining the key migration parameters for both
   molecules: the coefficients of diffusion and partition. The migration
   process was highly dependent on the storage conditions, the
   photoinitiator properties and the pH of the foodstuff. Full article

   Soluble or fermentable fibre has prebiotic effects that can be used in
   the food industry to modify the composition of microbiota species to
   benefit human health. Prebiotics mostly target Bifidobacterium and
   Lactobacillus strains, among others, which can fight against chronic
   diseases since colonic fermentation produces short chain fatty acids
   (SCFAs). The present work studied the changes produced in the fibre and
   polyphenolic compounds during in vitro digestion of gel (AV) and a
   polysaccharide extract (AP) from Aloe vera, after which, these
   fractions were subjected to in vitro colonic fermentation to evaluate
   the changes in antioxidant capacity and SCFAs production during the
   fermentation. The results showed that the phenolic compounds increased
   during digestion, but were reduced in fermentation, as a consequence,
   the antioxidant activity increased significantly in AV and AP after the
   digestion. On the other hand, during in vitro colon fermentation, the
   unfermented fibre of AV and AP responded as lactulose and the total
   volume of gas produced, which indicates the possible use of Aloe vera
   and polysaccharide extract as prebiotics. Full article

   Aptamers are small oligonucleotides that are capable of binding
   specifically to a target, with impressive potential for analysis,
   diagnostics, and therapeutics applications. Aptamers are isolated from
   large nucleic acid combinatorial libraries using an iterative selection
   process called SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential
   enrichment). Since being implemented 30 years ago, the SELEX protocol
   has undergone many modifications and improvements, but it remains a
   laborious, time-consuming, and costly method, and the results are not
   always successful. Each step in the aptamer selection protocol can
   influence its results. This review discusses key technical points of
   the SELEX procedure and their influence on the outcome of aptamer
   selection. Full article

   Since 2012, more than three million Syrian refugees have fled to
   Turkey. While these refugees vary in socioeconomic background, it is
   notable that 50% of Syrian refugee children in Turkey display symptoms
   of post-traumatic stress and that more than 663,138 of these children
   between the ages of six and seventeen are not enrolled in school. For
   those children who are in school, high levels of trauma have
   significant implications for the education system as trauma alters the
   brain and affects the way children learn. A Global Voice for Autism is
   an international non-governmental relief and development organization
   that exists to equip teachers and families in conflict-affected
   communities. Its intent is to support the development and success of
   children with autism and trauma-related behavioral challenges in their
   classrooms, home, and communities. The instabilities inherent in the
   Syrian refugee experience pose a number of challenges to the
   organization’s effective implementation of programming. The experiences
   of refugees in Turkey are highly gendered. Therefore, a qualitative
   gender analysis was conducted to address and better understand the
   challenges faced when carrying out these educational interventions. The
   article examines domestic violence, sexual violence, and masculinity as
   gender-driven constructs that influence how refugees experience trauma.
   In addition, structural issues in existing support systems all present
   significant challenges to Syrian refugee parents that impede effective
   program implementation. It is imperative to assess structural issues in
   existing support services to address these challenges and to
   successfully carry out meaningful and impactful programming. This Brief
   Report provides a series of recommendations in order to ameliorate
   these challenges and increase the efficacy of educational interventions
   with Syrian refugee parents of trauma-affected and vulnerable children
   in Turkey. It concludes with a call for policy changes that protect
   refugees from deportation when accessing support services and a network
   of services that do not require residency permits. It calls for
   increased integration of parent trauma support in educational
   intervention trainings and the creation of safe spaces where mothers
   and fathers can discuss their own trauma and challenges in the hope of
   significantly enhancing program efficacy. Full article
