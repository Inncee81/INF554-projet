NLM researchers uncover role of repetitive DNA and protein sequences in tumor
evolution

   Discovery may be useful in cancer diagnosis

   A team of researchers from the National Library of Medicine and
   collaborating academic research institutions developed a method to
   measure a type of gene mutation involved in the evolution of cancer.
   This type of mutation, called “repeat instability,” may be useful in
   early cancer diagnosis. Learn more.
