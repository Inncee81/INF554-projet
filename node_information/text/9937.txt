Me, Myself & Him by Chris Tebbetts. LOOOOOOOOOOOOVE.

   Me, Myself and Him   Here’s a book that you need but don’t know you
   need. Why is that? Because #1 if you’re looking for books containing an
   LGBTQ hero, here’s your book. But not because it’s your typical Coming
   Out. Story. While those are important, we’re past that. We need books
   where the kids […]

The Orphan Band of Springdale by Anne Nesbet a #Cybils middle grade finalist

   The Orphan Band of Springdale by Anne Nesbet So much packed into The
   Orphan Band of Springdale. It covers so many issues yet still manages
   to be a tender, touching story. It’s 1941, and tensions are rising in
   the United States as the Second World War rages in Europe.
   Eleven-year-old Gusta’s life, like the world […]

   Joanne Lew-Vriethoff, who has illustrated a number of SUPER ADORBS
   books like: Love and Beautiful Both of which were uplifting messages

Me, Myself & Him by Chris Tebbetts. LOOOOOOOOOOOOVE.

   Me, Myself and Him   Here’s a book that you need but don’t know you
   need. Why is that? Because #1 if you’re looking for books containing an
   LGBTQ hero, here’s your book. But not because it’s your typical Coming
   Out. Story. While those are important, we’re past that. We need books
   where the kids […]

The Orphan Band of Springdale by Anne Nesbet a #Cybils middle grade finalist

   The Orphan Band of Springdale by Anne Nesbet So much packed into The
   Orphan Band of Springdale. It covers so many issues yet still manages
   to be a tender, touching story. It’s 1941, and tensions are rising in
   the United States as the Second World War rages in Europe.
   Eleven-year-old Gusta’s life, like the world […]

   Joanne Lew-Vriethoff, who has illustrated a number of SUPER ADORBS

I AM #BLACKHISTORYMONTH – The March Against Fear by Ann Bausum

   Let’s celebrate Black History Month with The March Against Fear by Ann
   Bausum I am especially moved by this compelling book today. When it
   seems as if the United States should be much farther along in the Civil
   Rights Movement, a book comes along that makes you question that fact.
   Are we any better than […]
