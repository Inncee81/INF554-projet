Storyline

   Bound by an inescapable blood debt to the Italian crime lord, Santino
   D'Antonio, and with his precious 1969 Mustang still stolen, John
   Wick--the taciturn and pitiless assassin who thirsts for seclusion--is
   forced to visit Italy to honour his promise. But, soon, the Bogeyman
   will find himself dragged into an impossible task in the heart of
   Rome's secret criminal society, as every killer in the business dreams
   of cornering the legendary Wick who now has an enormous price on his
   head. Drenched in blood and mercilessly hunted down, John Wick can
   surely forget a peaceful retirement--as in this lethal ballet of
   bullets--no one can make it out in one piece. Written by Nick Riganas

   One of the best action movies I ever seen
   9 February 2017 | by cscd-745-377606 – See all my reviews

   I am retired at 41 years old and watch movies all day and night. I take
   my action films very serious.. From Die Hard to District 13, from First
   Blood to Taken... John Wick 2 is one of the best action movies I've
   seen. Simply put.. on a scale of the good old 80's red blooded American
   action films, John Wick 1 will draw you in and make you a fan, John
   Wick 2 will satisfy your soul with the 2017 evolution of 80's action
   with a feeling of have hit the gritty lotto.
   This is a man's man film that should be enjoyed after a hearty steak
   dinner (as I did tonight).
   I may have to go see this again.

Storyline

   As the United States raced against Russia to put a man in space, NASA
   found untapped talent in a group of African-American female
   mathematicians that served as the brains behind one of the greatest
   operations in U.S. history. Based on the unbelievably true life stories
   of three of these women, known as "human computers", we follow these
   women as they quickly rose the ranks of NASA alongside many of
   history's greatest minds specifically tasked with calculating the
   momentous launch of astronaut John Glenn into orbit, and guaranteeing
   his safe return. Dorothy Vaughan, Mary Jackson, and Katherine Gobels
   Johnson crossed all gender, race, and professional lines while their
   brilliance and desire to dream big, beyond anything ever accomplished
   before by the human race, firmly cemented them in U.S. history as true
   American heroes. Written by 20th Century Fox

Did You Know?

Trivia

   The actual working relationship between the engineers and women was not
   as hostile as it appears in the film. While there were clearly racial
   issues at play, the majority of the engineers were able to work with
   the computers with no issues. See more »
     __________________________________________________________________

Goofs

   Katherine describes the reentry problem as a transition from an
   elliptical orbit to a parabolic "orbit." The parabolic orbit, or more
   correctly parabolic trajectory since it takes an infinite time to
   complete, is the boundary case between a looping orbit and an escape
   orbit. So transition to a parabolic "orbit" would not bring you back to
   earth at all. Breaking for return using retro thrust, reduced the
   altitude of the orbit which remains elliptical, and reentry occurs when
   the ellipse intersects the Earth's atmosphere. See more »

   Exceptional, Jarring, and Thought-Provoking Unsung Heroes
   12 January 2017 | by valen060 – See all my reviews

   Not knowing what to expect, I checked out to see how the story of three
   female individuals made a difference at NASA back in 1961. I've
   witnessed in past historical dramas of where racism included violence,
   but that is not the case regarding Hidden Figures. Rather it focused
   more on how it was overcome in casual, everyday life (especially the
   workplace).
   The story revolves around three brilliant African-American women by the
   names of Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson as they
   live their lives working at NASA among a nearly all-white staff.
   Despite segregation still circulating at the time, each of them proved
   that no matter what color they were, it's their intellect and willpower
   that got them through each obstacle of the day and also helped make
   history for astronaut John Glenn to be the first American astronaut to
   completely orbit the Earth.
   With an interesting balance of wit and drama, I found its tribulations
   to be the main focus. Since the movie was based on true events, to me
   it felt like a wonderful tie-in to the 2014 drama "Selma" since that
   too revolved around a time when people marched to spread the word of
   ending segregation. But unlike Selma where black people and Dr. Martin
   Luther King fought for the right to vote, Hidden Figures tackled both
   the obstacles of racism and even sexism in of all places NASA. It was
   very jarring to see that despite the characters' extensive knowledge in
   their work and upon receiving their own respective degrees in their
   studies, it's still looked down upon by the self- righteous higher-ups.
   Taraji P. Henson (Empire) sure brought out a splendid performance as
   mathematician Katherine Johnson. Likewise for her costars Octavia
   Spencer (The Help) and Janelle Monae as they helped balance the drama,
   including sass to boot. Kevin Costner and 'Big Bang Theory' star Jim
   Parsons also helped give some depth (though I wouldn't call them
   antagonists) in these women's lives.
   Personally, I enjoyed the events that unfolded overall. When it came to
   the racial undertones and confrontations in a few scenes, myself and a
   few others in the theater old or young were left curious and appalled
   at the same time by how this was a thing in the 1960s compared to the
   present. It's sure to go far with various accolades.
   The moral: If you put your mind to it, things can be accomplished no
   matter how many would say otherwise.

Storyline

   In the winter of 1820, the New England whaling ship Essex was assaulted
   by something no one could believe: a whale of mammoth size and will,
   and an almost human sense of vengeance. The real-life maritime disaster
   would inspire Herman Melville's Moby-Dick. But that told only half the
   story. "In the Heart of the Sea" reveals the encounter's harrowing
   aftermath, as the ship's surviving crew is pushed to their limits and
   forced to do the unthinkable to stay alive. Braving storms, starvation,
   panic and despair, the men will call into question their deepest
   beliefs, from the value of their lives to the morality of their trade,
   as their captain searches for direction on the open sea and his first
   mate still seeks to bring the great whale down.

Trivia

   The casting director, Nina Gold, is also the casting director of Game
   of Thrones (2011), which probably explains why there are four actors,
   Michelle Fairley (Catelyn Stark), Joseph Mawle (Benjen Stark), Donald
   Sumpter (Maester Luwin), and Jamie Sives (Jory Cassel), that also
   appeared there. See more »
     __________________________________________________________________

Goofs

   The Essex was three masted (probably bark rigged) as described in
   Chase's own book about the voyage. The vessel in the movie is two
   masted (a brig) See more »

Quotes

   [first lines]
   Herman Melville: [in his letter] How does one come to know the
   unknowable? What faculties must a man possess? Since it was discovered
   that whale oil could light our cities in ways never achieved before, it
   created global demand. It has pushed man to venture further and further
   into the deep blue unknown. We know not its depths, nor the host of
   creatures that live there. Monsters. Are they real?
   [a huge whale passes]
   Herman Melville: Or do the stories exist only to make us respect the
   sea's dark secrets?

   Howards visually strong film sails between the waters of greatness and
   mediocrity
   3 December 2015 | by eddie_baggins – See all my reviews

   Let's deal with the elephant in the room or in this particular case the
   great white whale in the boat, old ginger top Ron Howard's impressive
   looking new high seas adventure is not one of the year's best (or
   awards player as many thought) but it's an often mightily enjoyable
   time out at the cinema thanks to its visual spectacle.
   Delayed from an early year release at years start and set a new opening
   timeslot in the awards friendly period of December, hype started
   building for this adaptation of Nathaniel Philbrick's well-loved novel
   (or simply the "real Moby Dick" story) that had many calling out the
   film as both a likely box office hot shot and a real wild card at this
   year's awards circuits.
   What singular element likely to hold In the Heart of the Sea back from
   such bounties is hard to pinpoint but a summation could be given to
   suggest a lack of heart and strangely plotted narrative are key factors
   to Heart's inability to truly set sail.
   Those who expected Heart to be a real man v whale high stakes thrill
   ride will be sorely disappointed as that's really not Howard's focus
   here while others may find themselves growing weary quickly of Heart's
   more survival against the odds scenario that sadly features characters
   we'd love to care a little more about.
   From all reports investing in the characters in Philbrick's book is not
   an issue but with Chris Hemsworth's Owen Chase here leading the charge
   as second mate of the Essex and its captain George Pollard (played to
   boorish effect by Benjamin Walker) the crew of this wailing vessel fail
   to engage us on their high stakes journey and as "big white" makes his
   debut and the crew start to be whittled down in number, a realisation
   dawns that Howard and his screenwriter Charles Leavitt haven't done
   enough for us to invest our emotions in their increasingly doomed
   plight against one huge freak of nature.
   After so-so turns in Snow White and the Huntsman and the beyond awful
   Blackhat, questions must now be raised about Hemsworth's ability to
   lead a film outside of his Thor comfort zone and whilst his not
   terrible here he's certainly not the one to help lead Heart forward to
   another level and in his struggles with nailing accents is again
   prevalent here although that's never stopped fellow Australian ex-pat
   Russell Crowe. Side players like Cillian Murphy's Matthew Joy and
   Brendan Gleeson's aged Thomas Nickerson end up making more of an
   impression but as like most of the ensemble they are underused and
   slightly underdeveloped.
   This real life Moby Dick is directed with enough assurance and visual
   flair by the professional and proficient Ron Howard that throughout its
   two hour run time there's enough to warrant a cinema screen viewing but
   you can't help escape the feeling that in the end we were never hooked
   the way we should be to this almost unbelievably huge adventure.
   In the Heart of the Sea assuredly sails between the waters of greatness
   and mediocrity to in the end become a sparingly thrilling yet
   forgettable telling of one unforgettable story.

Storyline

   Boston, 1926. The '20s are roaring. Liquor is flowing, bullets are
   flying, and one man sets out to make his mark on the world. Prohibition
   has given rise to an endless network of underground distilleries,
   speakeasies, gangsters, and corrupt cops. Joe Coughlin, the youngest
   son of a prominent Boston police captain, has long since turned his
   back on his strict and proper upbringing. Now having graduated from a
   childhood of petty theft to a career in the pay of the city's most
   fearsome mobsters, Joe enjoys the spoils, thrills, and notoriety of
   being an outlaw. But life on the dark side carries a heavy price. In a
   time when ruthless men of ambition, armed with cash, illegal booze, and
   guns, battle for control, no one-neither family nor friend, enemy nor
   lover-can be trusted. Beyond money and power, even the threat of
   prison, one fate seems most likely for men like Joe: an early death.
   But until that day, he and his friends are determined to live life to
   the hilt. Joe embarks on a dizzying... Written by Anonymous

Goofs

   Joe's father says that one of the policemen who fell in the lake died
   "of hypothermia". That's a technical term not used outside of the
   medical community until about 1975. In 1920, he might have said the
   officer died "of exposure" or even "of the cold." See more »

Quotes

   [first lines]
   Joe Coughlin: [narrating] In 1917, I signed up to fight the Huns in
   France. Good men died all around me, and I saw no reason for it. The
   rules we lived by were lies. And they didn't apply to those who made
   them. I swore If I made it home, I would never follow orders again. I
   left a soldier, I came home an outlaw.

   Unfulfilled promise
   5 January 2017 | by gsygsy – See all my reviews

   Producer, director, writer and lead actor: Ben Affleck.
   Let's look at those contributions one by one.
   Producer. The film looks good. There's an expert team on both sides of
   the camera. But there's a problem with length. Also, it feels as though
   the adaptation from Dennis Lehane's novel has not sufficiently
   transformed what was on the page into cinematic story-telling.
   Director. There are excellent action sequences, such as an exciting
   car-chase and a final shoot-out. As a director of actors Mr Affleck is
   strong: he elicits particularly striking work from Chris Messina, Elle
   Fanning, Remo Girone and Sienna Miller. Within scenes there's a
   reassuring sense of control of pace. But overall, there is a sense of
   the director being in thrall to the screenplay.
   Writer. This is the weakest link. It feels in awe of its source
   material. I read that an entire strand of the book was removed for the
   purposes of the film, but this was not enough. The producer and/or the
   director needed to tell the writer to put it through another draft. Or
   put it in its current form on Netflix as a two-part drama.
   Lead actor. A matter of taste, I guess. Mr Affleck's persona is always
   of a handsome man who knows he's handsome, and who is very pleased with
   himself about it. I find this insufferable in large doses. And there is
   a very large dose of it here. Mr Affleck's performances lack depth --
   compare and contrast those of this amazing brother Casey. As far as I'm
   concerned, Mr B. Affleck is more a male model than an actor: in James
   Bond terms, he's a George Lazenby rather than a Daniel Craig. His best
   film performance is his self-parodying turn in 'SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE'.
   In LIVE BY NIGHT he is serviceable, nothing more. His director clearly
   couldn't get anything else out of him.
   It's instructive to compare Ben Affleck to Clint Eastwood, who also has
   a limited -- maybe even more limited -- range as an actor. But Eastwood
   the director usually casts Eastwood the actor brilliantly. DIRTY HARRY,
   UNFORGIVEN,GRAN TORINO etc: who could be better? By contrast, there are
   many young actors who could have played the lead in LIVE BY NIGHT, and
   many writers who could have delivered a better screenplay, especially
   when guided by a strong producer and director. Time will tell whether
   Ben Affleck is as good in those last two departments as ARGO suggested
   he might be. The promise he showed in those areas in that film is not
   in evidence here.

Storyline

   In this interplanetary adventure, a space shuttle embarks on the first
   mission to colonize Mars, only to discover after takeoff that one of
   the astronauts is pregnant. Shortly after landing, she dies from
   complications while giving birth to the first human born on the red
   planet - never revealing who the father is. Thus begins the
   extraordinary life of Gardner Elliot - an inquisitive, highly
   intelligent boy who reaches the age of 16 having only met 14 people in
   his very unconventional upbringing. While searching for clues about his
   father, and the home planet he's never known, Gardner begins an online
   friendship with a street smart girl in Colorado named Tulsa. When he
   finally gets a chance to go to Earth, he's eager to experience all of
   the wonders he could only read about on Mars - from the most simple to
   the extraordinary. But once his explorations begin, scientists discover
   that Gardner's organs can't withstand Earth's atmosphere. Eager to find
   his father, Gardner escapes the team... Written by STX Entertainment

   Nathaniel Shepherd: [speaking from the podium] I wanted to go to Mars.
   Not just a visit, I want to live there. Because then I'd be living
   truth that life on Mars Is possible. Proof that if we had to, Mankind
   can make a fresh start. We're in trouble and it's our fault, and we're
   running out of time, and mother nature doesn't negotiate. We can't give
   up, not now. Mars is a planet, ripe and ready for life. Earth's

   Great love story
   3 February 2017 | by williamollerton – See all my reviews

   Don't be confused, this is a teen romance picture. It's just that one
   teen is from Earth, and the other is from Mars. I actually found it
   very sweet. Mars boy without a clue, and Earth girl with all the
   answers. Great acting, great direction, fantastic score. The special
   effect were a bit dodgy. This film was was supposed to come out in
   August, then pulled to December, and now it's released in February.
   Please see this film!!! I found it very uplifting. The performances of
   Asa Butterfield, Britt Robertson, Gary Oldman, Carla Gugino, and BD
   Wong are fantastic. I have to keep writing because IMDb won't let a
   review of anything less than 10 lines ling post. Did I mention this is
   a kid friendly film? Thank you.
