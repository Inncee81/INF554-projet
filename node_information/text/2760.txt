   An English translation of Baidu's Melody Chatbot

   Chinese search engine giant Baidu is launching a medical chatbot
   designed to make diagnosing illnesses easier. The conversational bot is
   named Melody and comes built into the company's iOS and Android Baidu
   Doctor app, which launched in China in 2015. Baidu Doctor allows users
   to contact local doctors, book appointments, and ask questions, with
   the chatbot intended to speed up this process.

   "What we found when operating Baidu Doctor is that when a patient asks
   a question, often the initial query doesn’t have enough information for
   a doctor to make the most confident decision," Andrew Ng, chief
   scientist at Baidu's Silicon Valley research center, tells The Verge.
   He says that what's needed is a conversation where the doctor narrows
   down information about the patient's symptoms. When did the headaches
   start, for example, and how long do they last; is the pain local or
   general, and so on.

   "[Melody] asks those additional questions," says Ng. "And as they're
   generated by AI, they're reactive, responding to what you've already
   said." He stresses, though, that Melody is not a replacement for
   doctors — it's merely intended to inform the advice that they offer.
   "By gathering more information for the doctor we believe it will help
   them make better diagnoses."

   The bot is powered by Baidu's deep learning and natural language
   processing systems, which the company has been investing in for years.
   The company also has the advantage of access to China's huge market of
   hundreds of millions of potential users, allowing it to access to a lot
   of data to improve its conversational skills. Currently the bot is only
   available in China, but Baidu is actively looking to explore new
   markets. "We are in discussion with healthcare services around the
   world, including Europe and the US," says Ng. "We're interested in
   helping with healthcare globally."

   A number of startups in the US and UK have launched similar apps,
   including Your.MD and Babylon Health. As with Baidu's chatbot, they use
   conversational bots to perform basic triage on patients. The apps have
   performed well in limited head-to-head comparisons with nurses, asking
   similar questions and coming to similar conclusions, but how they might
   fit into a whole country's health care system is a far more challenging
   question.

   How, for example, will such medical apps be regulated, and what happens
   if they're embraced by local governments, perhaps similar to how
   certain towns have decided to subsidize Uber instead of investing in
   public transit? And what happens to patients' data? (Ng says that while
   patient data is encrypted, all interactions with the bot are "logged.")

   Baidu's hope is that their medical AI won't supplant doctors, but just
   encourage more active health care. "There's always this debate when you
   build technology, whether it'll expand employment." says Ng. The
   invention of the automobile, for example, led to greater employment of
   taxi drivers. "But we'll see what happens with healthcare," he says,
   adding that so much change is coming to the industry as more
   information is digitized; turned into productive fodder for AI projects
   like Baidu's chatbot.
   For Baidu, it seems the focus is just on what it can deliver now. The
   company cites statistics from the World Health Organization that the
   world faces a deficit of some 13 million doctors and health care
   professionals over the next 20 years. "I think the shortage of
   healthcare providers is acute," says Ng. "We see doctors seeing huge
   numbers of patients every day — upwards of 80, 100, every day. We can
   help."
   Update October 11th, 1PM ET: Updated with additional comments from
   Andrew Ng.

   Amazon’s retail plans are growing from a single brick-and-mortar
   bookstore to a large network of pop-up shops in US malls, according to
   a report from Business Insider. These retail locations are said to be
   distinct from Amazon’s existing Seattle storefront, focusing not on
   books but on its growing number of consumer electronic devices. Those
   gadgets include the Kindle and Amazon Fire product lines, the Fire TV
   set-top box, the Dash button, and the Echo and Amazon Tap speakers.

   The company has already begun the rollout, with 21 stores located in 12
   states across the country. A new Amazon website details each of these
   locations, describing the pop-up shops as a way to ask experts about
   products, demo those products, and shop for accessories. The stores
   also serve another purpose: for every Amazon hardware product sold, the
   company gains one more way to sell Amazon products and services like
   Prime. (On the book side, the company is said to be expanding its book
   store operation from Seattle to New York City, Chicago, and Portland.)

   "Pop-up shops push people to use Amazon.com and sign up for Prime"

   A series of job listings, unearthed by Business Insider, describe these
   established pop-up shops as part of test phase that is now over. The
   listings say Amazon is ready to grow and expand the operation, and the
   report states the number of pop-up shops could exceed 30 by year’s end
   and grow to as many as 100 locations by next year. "We offer pop-up
   kiosks so that customers can try out all our new devices and learn
   about our services like Prime and unique content like Amazon
   Originals," Amazon said in a statement.

   During a shareholder meeting in May, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said the
   company would be more aggressive in its retail expansion, partly as a
   way to educate itself on which sales tactics work best in offline
   environments. "We’re definitely going to open additional stores, how
   many we don’t know yet," he said. "In these early days it’s all about
   learning, rather than trying to earn a lot of revenue."

   Ikea has come out with a new line of furniture that, according to the
   company, can be assembled within just five minutes. The new Regissör
   series, announced this week, includes a coffee table, bookshelf, and
   cabinets — all of which can be put together without any tools.

   The key is a set of newly designed wooden dowels attached to the joints
   of each piece, replacing the annoying screws and locks that the company
   traditionally uses. These dowels are placed at a 45-degree angle along
   the wedged ends of each board, allowing for more natural support than
   the usual 90-degree orientation. The boards are also made of a lighter
   material, designed to lessen the stress on each corner.

   The Regissör series goes on sale this month at US Ikea locations, with
   prices ranging from $139 for the table to $349 for the cabinet.

Instagram’s latest assault on Snapchat is a messaging app called Threads

   The app promotes sharing your status, location, and more with your
   closest friends
     * By Casey Newton

   Facebook is developing a new messaging app called Threads that is meant
   to promote constant, intimate sharing between users and their closest
   friends, The Verge has learned. Threads, which is designed as a
   companion app to Instagram, invites users to automatically share their
   location, speed, and battery life with friends, along with more typical
   text, photo, and video messages using Instagram’s creative tools. The
   app, which is designed for sharing with your “close friends” list on
   Instagram, is now being tested internally at Facebook.

   Instagram declined to comment.

   In May, Instagram ceased work on Direct, a standalone messaging app
   that it had been developing since late 2017. At the time, executives
   said that beta testers were frustrated about having to switch between
   Instagram and a second app whenever they wanted to send a message. But
   the company has remained interested in building new messaging
   experiences, executives have said. Instagram employees who work on
   messaging were moved to the Facebook Messenger team earlier this year
   as part of a broader consolidation between the parent company and its
   prized acquisition.

   A messaging app built around your close friends might be more popular.
   That’s what Snapchat already is today for a healthy portion of its
   users. Reports have indicated that the average Snapchat user spends
   more time inside the app than the average Instagram user does. For
   Facebook and Instagram, which have long coveted Snapchat’s strong
   engagement among younger users, Threads could represent another effort
   to chip away at their rival’s appeal.

   Screenshots reviewed by The Verge show an app that’s designed to
   promote constant, automatic sharing between users and the people on
   their “close friends” list on Instagram. Opt in to automatic sharing,
   and Threads will regularly update your status, giving your friends a
   real-time view of information about your location, speed, and more. At
   the moment, Threads does not display your real-time location — instead,
   it might say something like a friend is “on the move,” according to
   sources familiar with the matter.

   You can also update your status manually, with statuses appearing in
   the main feed along with messages. It’s the latest effort to automate
   status sharing using mobile phone sensors and one-tap status sharing.
   (An app called Status tried something similar in 2014, and Danny
   Trinh’s Free app took another approach in 2015.)

   The core of Threads appears to be messaging, and it looks very similar
   to the existing messaging product inside Instagram. Messages from your
   friends appear in a central feed, with a green dot indicating which of
   your friends are currently active. If your friend has posted a story
   recently, you can view that from inside Threads as well. Threads also
   has a camera, which you can use to capture photos and videos and send
   them to your close friends.

   It’s unclear when Threads might launch. Facebook might end development
   before shipping the app to the general public, as it did with Direct.
   But Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in March that he sees private
   messaging as the future of the company. Threads appears to represent
   the company’s latest effort to make that vision a reality.

   Good. I was just telling myself I need a 5th messaging app to try and
   keep in contact with my friends. /s

   In all seriousness, I’m sure this will be great. The problem is that
   messaging apps have been proven to be both geographical and
   generational – most people outside of the US use Whatsapp. In the US,
   you’re kind of divided by iMessage, Snapchat (which caters to one
   generation), Facebook Messenger (another generation), Tik Tok (another,
   probably the newest generation)… It’s getting a little ridiculous these
   days.

   By MarcintheCloud on 08.26.19 6:57pm

   I’d guess that iMessage is the most popular messaging app (outside of
   basic SMS) in the United States. People of all generations use it,
   whether they realize it or not, because of how ubiquitous the iPhone is
   here. I believe around 40% market share? Young people like it for
   cultural reasons, and older people use it because it’s what comes on
   the phone.

   By RyHerbs on 08.26.19 7:35pm

   yea I agree, I think it goes SMS , then Imessage, then likely
   Messenger, then Snapchat.

   I think this new app is thinking outside the box, which is nice to see
   someone trying something slightly different.

   By Lindsey Schlabach on 08.26.19 8:56pm

   well i wouldn’t group imessage and sms with other apps since they’re
   opt-out and treated as the go to form of text communication via phone
   numbers

   By VIIIXXIX on 08.26.19 11:28pm

   Who cares. It’s what people use

   By amazingMic on 08.27.19 5:09am

   Here in the Philippines we still rely on SMS a lot, then followed by
   Facebook Messenger and Viber as the two most popular outside SMS, and
   very few users of WhatsApp, WeChat, and Telegram.

   By greenarcher02 on 08.27.19 2:42am

   Not to mention Telegram if you want to talk securely!

   By kalotro on 08.27.19 4:26am

   Cool! If it’s well integrated with Instagram’s chat service and
   Facebook Messenger, instead of its own separate thing, I’m into it.
   Hopefully I can get my last friend who uses Snapchat to switch over to
   Instagram like the rest of us with this app.

   By IKeepSwitchingBetweeniOSAndAndroid on 08.26.19 9:07pm

   Way to differentiate yourself; with features such as tracking your
   friends speed and battery life

   By Drapery on 08.26.19 10:49pm

   I do not need another level of anxiety on top of my anxiety over my own
   battery life.

   By greenarcher02 on 08.27.19 2:54am

   The battery life indicator might be a safety feature to check up on
   friends who are by themselves. And also to understand why a friend
   might not have replied to your message yet.

   By kalotro on 08.27.19 4:26am

   So if your friend has full battery and hasn’t replied, will you be
   messaging them "Why aren’t you replying to me, Hannah?"

   If this is a feature you want, you’ve got issues

   By Drapery on 08.27.19 5:04pm

   On one hand, yeah it can be useful for checking up on loved ones,
   especially in natural disasters. On the other, what Drapery said. "I
   know you’re on full battery why aren’t you replying?"

   By greenarcher02 on 09.05.19 11:19pm

   Good. We really needed that. Perhaps they could add an extra chat
   function to Whatsapp too.

   Crazy.

   By McJabberclackers on 08.27.19 2:44am

   No one:
   Nobody ever:
   Not even a soul:
   Facebook: Here’s a new chat app!

   By kalotro on 08.27.19 4:25am

   I think private networks are the future of social media and this might
   be a move towards that. Instead of just making it another messaging
   service, maybe they should focus on making this a private network to
   launch the next big platform themselves, instead of acquiring what
   becomes popular next.

   By CanChn on 08.27.19 4:27am

   This clustermess is what you get when GSM standards and practices had
   failed to enforce operators to switch to RCS on initial release back in
   2008. Cause by 2012 RCS would have become do-it-all-be-it-all for
   communication (voice, text, video, file sharing, phonebook, location
   sharing etc).

   But they didn’t. So now we are still waiting for Universal Profile
   adoption that doesn’t have one fifth of all the features that have been
   available since version 5 back in 2012.

   By Texax on 08.27.19 10:56am

   This is clearly for a younger audience that I don’t understand, because
   I have no idea why anyone would need to know or care about where I am
   at all times of the day and night. Not to mention that I don’t want
   them knowing!

   By CrabbyCrabberson on 08.27.19 10:57am

   Sounds creepy and invasive. Battery life, speed, location, wtf?!

   By SC310 on 08.27.19 11:22am

   It’s for the social media generation: Look at me, I’m standing next to
   a rock! Look at me, I’m in the bathroom! Look at me, I’m outside and
   swipe right to see a pic of me inside! Now I’m on the couch watching a
   movie with my pet gerbil!! Isn’t my life the most excitingest thing
   ever?!?
