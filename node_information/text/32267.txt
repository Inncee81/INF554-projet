Samsung device specifications

   Are you looking for the technical specifications of a particular
   Samsung Galaxy device version? How much RAM did the US version of the
   Galaxy S4 have? Which antenna bands does the Korean Galaxy Note 8
   support? The answer to such questions can be found in SamMobile's
   device archive, one the web's largest databases of Samsung device
   specifications.

How to search

   You can search our database by device name or by model number. No
   matter how you search, you will need to know the model number of the
   device you are looking for, as different device versions are identified
   by that number. Of course, you can also you our extensive set of
   filters, to search devices by any of their most important features. For
   example, you can quickly find all Samsung devices running the Tizen
   operating system or show only tablets by selecting that model type.

Compare Samsung specifications

   Once you have made your device selection you can click on
   'specifications' to show all details of that particular device.
   However, you can also search and select another device, and hit
   'compare these devices' for a side-by-side view of all features. Note:
   we usually list the version of a device's operating system at the time
   of release. Usually, device will receive one or several OS updates
   during its support period. Current OS version might therefore be
   different from the version listed in our database.

What is my model number?

   (BUTTON) ×

   For most devices, the model number (e.g. "GT-I9505" or "SM-G900F") is
   found inside the device. It becomes visible when you open your device
   and remove the battery.

   As an alternative, you can also type your model name (e.g. "GALAXY S5")
   instead of the number. But it may be a bit more difficult to find your
   specific device that way.

   Still not sure? Then perhaps Samsung can help you out with their
   model number lookup tool.
   (BUTTON) OK, I got it!
