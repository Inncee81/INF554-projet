Microsoft issues 'save the date' for expected October hardware event

   Microsoft is holding a fall hardware launch in New York City and an
   ARM-based Surface with LTE and an AMD-based Surface Laptop could be
   among the devices debuting there.

   We Microsoft watchers have been hearing for a while now that Microsoft
   would hold some kind of hardware event in October in New York City.
   Today, August 27, Microsoft sent out "save the date" placeholders for
   the October 2, 2019 event.
   For the past couple of years, Microsoft has held a separate hardware
   launch event in the fall in New York. This year, I'm hearing that we
   will see and hear about some new Surface devices, including a Qualcomm
   8cx-based Surface ARM device at the event. That device, which some of
   my contacts say could be priced around $999, will be an
   Always-Connected PC with built-in LTE support.
   There also has been talk about Microsoft introducing an AMD-based
   Surface Laptop at this fall hardware event. A refreshed Surface Pro
   device, possibly with USB-C support, could debut at this event, as
   well, some tipsters have said. I've heard some talk that Microsoft
   won't be adding built-in LTE support to new Intel-based Surface Pro
   devices, moving forward, but instead will make built-in LTE a feature
   of ARM-based devices only.

   Microsoft could potentially use the October event to announce a ship
   date for its HoloLens 2 device. Microsoft provided the specs and
   pricing for HoloLens 2 earlier this year.

   I don't think Microsoft will introduce its dual-screen, Courier-like
   Centaurus device at this event, however. Even though Microsoft
   officials showed off advanced renders of the device internally this
   summer, I don't think it's ready for introduction yet, based on tips
   I've gotten. It sounds like if it does end up coming to market,
   Centaurus could be a 2020 thing. Both Centaurus and HoloLens 2 are
   expected to be running Windows Core OS inside.

   Microsoft is not commenting on what to expect at the October event or
   with its future Surface line-up at this time.

   At Microsoft's last year's fall hardware event -- also on October 2 --
   the company introduced Surface Pro 6, Surface Laptop 2, Surface Studio
   2 and Surface headphones.

Researchers find security flaws in 40 kernel drivers from 20 vendors

   Affected vendors include the likes of Intel, AMD, NVIDIA, ASRock, AMI,
   Gigabyte, Realtek, Huawei, and more.

   Raspberry Pi: A cheat sheet
     * Read More

   At the DEF CON 27 security conference today in Las Vegas, security
   researchers from Eclypsium gave a talk about common design flaws they
   found in more than 40 kernel drivers from 20 different hardware
   vendors.

   The common design flaws is that low-privileged applications can use
   legitimate driver functions to execute malicious actions in the most
   sensitive areas of the Windows operating system, such as the Windows
   kernel.

   "There are a number of hardware resources that are normally only
   accessible by privileged software such as the Windows kernel and need
   to be protected from malicious read/write from userspace applications,"
   Mickey Shkatov, Principal Researcher at Eclypsium told ZDNet in an
   email earlier this week.

   "The design flaw surfaces when signed drivers provide functionality
   which can be misused by userspace applications to perform arbitrary
   read/write of these sensitive resources without any restriction or
   checks from Microsoft," he added.

   Shkatov blames the issues he discovered on bad coding practices, which
   don't take security into account.

   "This is a common software design anti-pattern where, rather than
   making the driver only perform specific tasks, it's written in a
   flexible way to just perform arbitrary actions on behalf of userspace,"
   he told ZDNet.

   "It's easier to develop software by structuring drivers and
   applications this way, but it opens the system up for exploitation."

Impacted vendors

   Shkatov said his company has notified each of the hardware vendors that
   were shipping drivers that allow userspace apps to run kernel code.
   Vendors who issued updates are listed below.

   ● American Megatrends International (AMI)
   ● ASRock
   ● ASUSTeK Computer
   ● ATI Technologies (AMD)
   ● Biostar
   ● EVGA
   ● Getac
   ● GIGABYTE
   ● Huawei
   ● Insyde
   ● Intel
   ● Micro-Star International (MSI)
   ● NVIDIA
   ● Phoenix Technologies
   ● Realtek Semiconductor
   ● SuperMicro
   ● Toshiba

   "Some vendors, like Intel and Huawei, have already issued updates. Some
   which are IBVs [independent BIOS vendors] like Phoenix and Insyde are
   releasing their updates to their customer OEMs," Shkatov told ZDNet.

   The Eclypsium researcher said he did not name all the impacted vendors,
   though, as some "needed extra time due to special circumstances" and
   future fixes and advisories will be released in the future.

   The Eclypsium researcher said he plans to publish the list of affected
   drivers and their hashes on GitHub, after the talk so users and
   administrators can block the affected drivers.

   In addition, Shaktov said Microsoft will be using its HVCI
   (Hypervisor-enforced Code Integrity) capability to blacklist drivers
   that are reported to them.

   However, Shaktov said that the HVCI feature is only supported on 7th
   gen Intel CPUs and onwards. Manual intervention will be needed on older
   systems, and even on newer Intel CPUs where HVCI can't be enabled.

   "In order to exploit vulnerable drivers, an attacker would need to have
   already compromised the computer," Microsoft said in a statement. "To
   help mitigate this class of issues, Microsoft recommends that customers
   use Windows Defender Application Control to block known vulnerable
   software and drivers. Customers can further protect themselves by
   turning on memory integrity for capable devices in Windows
   Security.Microsoft works diligently with industry partners to address
   to privately disclose vulnerabilities and work together to help protect
   customers."

   More details will be available on the Eclypsium blog later today.

Facebook debuts Libra cryptocurrency: a Bitcoin killer?

   The social network’s rumored cryptocurrency has landed, but how it will
   be received remains to be seen.

   Facebook offers peek into its future Libra cryptocurrency

   Facebook has announced Libra, a new cryptocurrency which will launch in
   2020 and which will integrate with the firm's apps and services.

   The social networking giant's interest in the cryptocurrency space and
   blockchain technologies has been rumored for months and was recently
   claimed that Facebook was on the verge of announcing its own virtual
   currency.

   Only last week, reports suggested that the coin was in development with
   the backing of major financial institutions including Visa, Mastercard,
   and PayPal, as well as firms including Uber, Lyft, and eBay.

   A number of these companies are now believed to have joined a
   consortium backing Facebook's foray into the cryptocurrency space, but
   one thing is certain: Libra is on its way to the social networking
   platform.

   On Tuesday, Facebook revealed the "early stage" project in a blog post.
   One of Facebook's subsidiaries, Calibra, is managing the Libra network,
   which will include the blockchain infrastructure required to facilitate
   the exchange of the Libra cryptocurrency.

   Calibra will introduce a digital wallet for Libra and the storage
   system will be integrated with Messenger and WhatsApp, as well as
   become available as a standalone iOS and Android app potentially for
   use with third-party vendors and e-commerce platforms.

   Expected to debut in 2020, Libra seems to be Facebook's punt into the
   mobile payments space. The company says that the cryptocurrency will be
   tradable with "almost anyone with a smartphone," and will fit use cases
   such as paying bills, buying coffee, or using public transit.

   PayPal: report

   These lofty goals will require partnerships with a wide variety of
   organizations willing to accept the cryptocurrency in lieu of
   traditional, fiat currency, and so developing the "early stage" project
   for mainstream use is likely to be an uphill battle.

   However, there are cases in which Facebook's coin might be more widely
   accepted, such in areas where obtaining a bank account is difficult, or
   as an alternative to cash for growing small businesses in developing
   countries.

   Facebook is keen to emphasize that the wallets used to store Libra will
   have "all the same verification and anti-fraud processes that banks and
   credit cards use, and we'll have automated systems that will
   proactively monitor activity to detect and prevent fraudulent
   behavior."

   The social networking giant says that "Calibra customers' account
   information and financial data will not be used to improve ad targeting
   on the Facebook family of products" and only in "limited cases" will
   information be shared to "reflect our need to keep people safe, comply
   with the law and provide basic functionality to the people who use
   Calibra."

   TechRepublic: Why cryptocurrency needs to get more user-friendly to
   achieve mainstream success

   It's up to the potential future Calibra customers to decide whether or
   not they trust Facebook enough to enter their financial affairs.
   However, given Facebook's track record of privacy scandals and customer
   data mishandling, it is unsurprising that the firm wants to try and
   distance itself from data misuse when it comes to the Calibra project.

   At first glance, it appears that Calibra is intended to be the backbone
   of a new financial ecosystem, rather than a challenger to
   cryptocurrencies already entrenched in the space, such as Bitcoin or
   Ethereum.

   CNET: Blockchain explained: It builds trust when you need it most

   While Bitcoin has slowly gained acceptance with some retailers as a
   method of payment, the BTC market's volatility has made Bitcoin more of
   an investment punt and speculative investment rather than a standard
   method of paying for goods and services.

   Libra is unlikely to touch the popularity of other major
   cryptocurrencies, but given the coin's backing by traditional financial
   organizations, it will be interesting to see whether Libra is adopted
   enthusiastically or dismissed by individuals already happy enough with
   current mobile payment systems and cryptocurrency offerings.
