Bacon-Wrapped Chicken Thighs with Apple Cider Pan Sauce

   November 14, 2019 — Leave a Comment

   This is a sponsored post written by me on behalf of Draper Valley Farms
   for IZEA Worldwide. All opinions are 100% mine.

   I’m really excited to share this new recipe with you guys. These
   bacon-wrapped chicken thighs are really easy to make, so they’re great
   for weeknights. They also look fancy enough for weekend meals or
   special occasions. Regardless of when you decide to make them, they are
   tender, delicious, and flavorful, so you’ll be winning at the dinner
   game.

   I love using RANGER® and ROXY™ products from Draper Valley Farms. They
   come from free-range chickens raised locally in the Pacific Northwest
   in Washington and Oregon. They’re fed a non-GMO, 100% vegetarian diet,
   and they have no antibiotics ever. For this recipe, I used RANGER® Free
   Range Boneless Skinless Chicken Thighs. I love chicken thighs because
   they turn out flavorful and juicy when you cook them.

   I wanted to give these chicken thighs a sweet, smoky flavor perfect for
   chilly Fall evenings. I started by rubbing the thighs with a blend of
   brown sugar and spices like garlic and smoky sweet paprika. Then I
   wrapped the chicken thighs with applewood smoked bacon and cooked them
   to a deep golden brown in a cast-iron skillet. After cooking the
   chicken, I made a savory-sweet pan sauce with shallots, thyme, and
   apple cider. The finished dish is so flavorful and delicious, with the
   perfect balance of savory, sweet, and smoky. I know you’re going to
   love it!

   Serves: 3-4 servings
   Ingredients
     * 1 package RANGER® Free Range Boneless Skinless Chicken Thighs
       (about 1½ pounds)
     * 1 Tablespoons brown sugar
     * ¾ teaspoon kosher salt
     * ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
     * ½ teaspoon smoked paprika
     * ½ teaspoon garlic powder
     * ½ teaspoon onion powder
     * ¼ teaspoon ground mustard
     * 5-6 slices applewood smoked bacon (1 slice per chicken thigh)
     * 2 Tablespoons butter, divided
     * 4 teaspoons minced shallots
     * 1½ teaspoons minced fresh thyme
     * ½ cup apple cider
     * 1 Tablespoon apple cider vinegar
     * minced fresh parsley for garnish

   Instructions
    1. Preheat a cast-iron skillet over medium-low heat. In a small bowl,
       combine brown sugar, salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder, onion
       powder, and mustard. Pat the chicken thighs dry with paper towels,
       then generously season both sides of each chicken thigh with the
       spice mixture. Use up all of the spice mixture. Wrap each seasoned
       chicken thigh with a slice of bacon, then place the chicken into
       the hot skillet. Cook on one side for 8-10 minutes until golden
       brown, then flip and continue cooking until the chicken is cooked
       through, about 13-14 more minutes. If you have a meat thermometer,
       the temperature of the chicken should be 170°F when it is fully
       cooked. Remove the chicken from the skillet, place it on a plate,
       and set it aside while you make the pan sauce. Drain all of the
       bacon fat from the skillet. Add half of the butter to the skillet.
       Add the shallots and thyme, and sauté for 2-3 minutes until tender
       and fragrant. Add the apple cider and simmer until the liquid has
       reduced slightly, 1-2 minutes. Add the remaining butter and the
       apple cider vinegar, and cook until the butter is melted. Remove
       from heat. Add the chicken back to the pan, spoon a little sauce
       over each chicken thigh, top with minced fresh parsley, and serve.
