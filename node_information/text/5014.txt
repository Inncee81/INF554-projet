   Do you remember that photo of Princess Diana, arms aloft and expression
   joyful, winning the mums’ race at William’s prep school? When you’ve
   finished wondering whether the other mothers let her win, the most
   striking thing is how inappropriately dressed they all are. Skirts
   billow above Sloaney mum-pumps and hair flows beneath velvet Alice
   bands.

   Today, they’d be fully clad in sweat-wicking running tights and
   clutching protein shakes. As Britain’s population become more obese,
   children’s sports days have become increasingly competitive as if
   athletic prowess were a signifier of moral superiority and good
   parenting.

   This is further fuelled by social media which is filled with #dadsrace
   and photos of the spoils of glory (stickers, certificates and medals).
   Twitter and Instagram are stuffed full of humblebrags and just plain
   brags as they flock to inform the world they’ve still got it. ‘Dads’
   race champ 3 years in a row,’ reads one typical example.

   PARENTS RACES- SCHOOL SPORTS DAY
   Credit: Philip Hollis/TMG

   Osteopaths and physiotherapists report an upsurge of business at this
   time of year with hamstring strains and lower back injuries being top
   of the list of ailments. My husband runs the dads’ five-a-side football
   for our kids’ primary and every week another one ends up in A&E with a
   poignant physical embodiment of the gap between hope and experience.

   One osteopath even gives out a list of top tips including proper
   warm-ups and eschewing of flipflops. What they don’t advise, and
   should, is that a crucial part of preparation is to know your
   opposition, which will likely fall into one of the following
   categories.

1. The Former Athlete

   This is particularly prevalent in prep schools in South West London and
   in Alderley Edge near Manchester, where there’s an abundance of
   footballers and other sportsmen who’ve been successful enough to afford
   the exorbitant fees. One father I know, who has long hung up his
   running shoes, still remembers the look of fearsome determination on
   former England rugby captain Lawrence Dallaglio’s face as they lined up
   for the 100m. The flanker won, needless to say.

   It’s not all bad news for the less alpha. A friend told me that David
   Beckham deliberately and nonchalently threw the dads’ race at his boys’
   prep school. Forget all the work for Unicef, Becks deserves a
   knighthood for this piece of altruism alone. There are middle-aged
   bankers across West London who will be dining out on protein shakes for
   the rest of the lives thanks to this.

2. The Lycra Imposter

   Some mothers dress for the school run as if it were the school marathon
   with head-to-toe Lululemon, Nike and Sweaty Betty. It’s easy to assume
   that they’ll be demons on the track, but it turns out that they’re
   putting the leisure into the term athleisure. If you’ve ever seen the
   very funny Skit Box viral video mocking women who wear activewear for
   not-active things (‘doing literally nothing in my activewear’), you’ll
   know the type. She loves the bum-enhancing properties of yoga pants far
   more than actually doing the downward dog.

3. The Serious Trainer

   One poster on social media, with no apparent irony, wrote this week:
   ‘hard couple of weeks, sprint training, fartlek, circuits and long
   endurance runs but today I bore the fruits of my labours and smashed
   it’. For these mums and dads, it’s the winning not the taking part and
   they’ll leave nothing to chance.

4. The Too-Cool-for-School Sports Day

   He’s young, he’s bearded and he’s wearing trainers – he should be good.
   But no, it turns out his feet are shod in an import-only drop from
   indie Japanese brand Terrem that has nothing to do with sport and
   everything to do with his hipster pride. If your Scandi Axel Arigatos
   cost £150 and you got them via a waiting list, the last thing you’ll
   want to do in them is sprint.

5. The Young-Enough-To-Be-Your-Son/Daughter one

   My children’s primary allegedly has the most economically mixed
   catchment area in Britain. This makes for a heartening mix of
   ethnicities, dress codes, backgrounds and ages. Heartening, that is,
   until sports day when for all my moisturising and Barry’s Boot Camp,
   there’s no disguising that there are grandparents younger than me. Just
   because I know some Stormzy lyrics, doesn’t mean I can outrun the woman
   who went to school with him.

6. The Vicarious Competitor

   ‘If you can beat them, make sure your child can’ is the motto of this
   parent. They stand at the side with their stop watches and energy gels,
   shouting encouragement/abuse at their offspring, exhorting them to
   crush the opposition (which consists of a crying five-year-old). One
   Sunday recently we bumped into a dad who was on his bike with his two
   kids running beside him, trainer-from-Rocky style, as he shouted at
   them to lift their knees up.

7 The Vocalizer

   Closely related (often by marriage) to the Vicarious Competitor, this
   one won’t run but boy will she shout. If there were Olympic medals for
   hollering, she’d get gold. Sometimes the screeching is so intense, one
   wonders whether she might in fact be drunk, despite it being 10 in the
   morning, an impression not hindered by the occasionally fruity
   language. It’s like that scene in My Fair Lady when Audrey Hepburn’s
   Eliza screams ‘Come on, Dover! Move your bloomin’ arse’ except without
   the splendid costumes and parasol.

8 The Very Important Career Person

   ‘I’m at my son’s sports day,’ this one booms into his or her mobile,
   the device they’re surgically attached to for the duration. ‘Can’t talk
   long,’ they say as they proceed to do just that, using the words
   synergy and optimisation a lot. Even when not talking, their eyes are
   glued to the screen as little Felix throws a bean bag at their head to
   try to get some attention. To no avail.

Ipswich sweep back to Europe

   Europe bound: Alun Armstrong runs to congratulate Jermaine Wright on
   sealing another Ipswich victory

   By Patrick Barclay at Portman Road

   7:50PM BST 21 Apr 2001

   Ipswich (1) 2 Coventry (0) 0

   TWENTY YEARS after Ipswich won the UEFA Cup, the splendidly run Suffolk
   club celebrated qualification for next season's competition with this
   victory, which restored Coventry's less desirable status as clear
   relegation favourites.

   [sport-graphics-2001_985658a.jpg]

   But Ipswich may have a bigger fish to fry. Indeed they may shortly be
   afforded the luxury of waiving their prize in order to participate in
   the Champions League. George Burley's team are still three points ahead
   of Leeds, who have a match in hand but a slightly inferior goal
   difference.

   Chelsea's challenge faded significantly, leaving Liverpool the only
   other realistic contenders for third place (on the assumption Arsenal
   finish second) and over Liverpool, who face Tottenham today in the
   first of their matches in hand, Ipswich have the considerable advantage
   of breathing space; with nearly a month of the season left, Burley's
   men face just three matches - Manchester City at home and Charlton and
   Derby away - compared with the eight awaiting Gerard Houllier's.

   Coventry, who play host to Liverpool next Saturday, could have no
   complaint at losing here, even if after a one-sided first half, during
   which Martijn Reuser put Ipswich in front, they rallied and were
   striving for an equaliser when Jermaine Wright scored. The 34 minutes
   left contained nothing in the nature of a contest, Ipswich knowing that
   their seventh win in nine matches would carry them back into Europe
   less than a year after promotion.

   Richard Wright, their fledgling international goalkeeper, missed it. He
   suffered a back injury in the warm-up and was hastily replaced by Keith
   Branagan, the burly 34-year-old making his third appearance since
   arriving at Portman Road on a free transfer from Bolton a year ago.

   Branagan was in action before long, diving to tame a low ball from
   Marcus Hall. This initial flurry, however, was all Coventry could
   manage as Ipswich took control, sweeping smoothly across the full width
   of the pitch as ever.

   So it was no surprise when Ipswich moved in front. The details were
   interesting, for Burley seems to encourage his strikers to drop deep
   and create and thus Alun Armstrong popped up to feed Wright, who timed
   his advance nicely, beat Hall and crossed; in the goalmouth Matt
   Holland and Barry Quinn distracted each other, letting the ball through
   to Reuser, whose firm shot went through the inevitably large gap
   between Chris Kirkland and the far post.

   All the while Branagan was little more than a spectator. The bulk of
   play remained in Coventry's half, where Marcus Stewart now displayed a
   catholic approach to the striker's role, roaming to win the ball and
   find Reuser so that Hermann Hreidarsson, overlapping with
   characteristic enthusiasm, could pick out the eager head of Armstrong
   at the near post; the trajectory asked too much, though, Armstrong
   failing to screw the ball back over his shoulder sharply enough to
   exercise Kirkland.

   Coventry had won three of their previous four matches and been far from
   disgraced - at Old Trafford - in the other, yet here they were being
   obliged to chase most of the time as Ipswich's neat, tutored football
   made excellent use of an admirable pitch.

   Before the match Gordon Strachan had said of his team's improved
   fortunes: "The football's no different. All that's happened is that
   we've started scoring goals." They could hardly do so without making
   chances and after the interval we looked for a sign of revival, a hint
   that the vigour of John Hartson, whom Ipswich had isolated, could be
   brought to bear.

   It soon was - but not effectively, because the challenge that briefly
   laid out Hartson's former Wimbledon clubmate Hreidarsson was spotted by
   the referee. Hartson's next intervention gave Coventry much more of a
   lift, his deft header setting up John Eustace, to whose superb instant
   drive Branagan responded with a breathtaking one-handed save. Then
   Hartson sent through Craig Bellamy who, pursued by a posse, poked the
   ball across the face of Branagan's goal.

   So it was harsh that Coventry, just as they were threatening to draw
   level, should fall further behind. Poor clearances, first by Kirkland
   and then Gary Breen, issued an invitation to the home side and Wright
   took it with relish, letting fly from 25 yards. Kirkland's gape
   suggested a deflection on the way into the net.

UK Athletics chief Neils De Vos puts Olympic gold rush down to 'technological
doping’

Niels de Vos, the chief executive of UK Athletics, has suffered a serious
embarrassment after a private speech in which he described the
multi-million-pound investments in hi-tech Olympic sports such as cycling,
rowing and sailing as “technological doping” was posted on the YouTube
website.

   Neil De Vos puts Olympic gold rush down to 'technological doping’
   Embarrassed: Neils de Vos admitted he used an 'ill-chosen
   phrase' Photo: PA

   De Vos, who has been in charge of the athletics governing body since
   2007, was delivering what he clearly understood to be a private lecture
   to students of his former Oxford University college, Keble, a month
   after the Olympic Games.

   But on Friday night he was forced to own up to an “ill-chosen phrase”
   after drawing a distinction between the technology-driven sports that
   delivered the bulk of Britain’s gold medals at London 2012 and his own
   sport of track and field.

   Outlining the history of Lottery investment since the low point of the
   1996 Atlanta Olympics when Britain managed just a single gold medal, De
   Vos highlighted the influence of Peter Keen, who preceded David
   Brailsford as performance director of British Cycling.

   De Vos said: “Peter Keen came in and said, ‘Forget about cycling, it’s
   all about sprinting on the track because if you give me money I can
   make a difference and win medals’.

   “That philosophy flowed through. It flowed through rowing, it flowed
   through sailing. We had an inbuilt advantage anyway as we could afford
   to do those sports. But you knew that if you were technologically ahead
   of everyone else, it could make half a second difference.

   “They talk about aggregation of marginal gains. I personally don’t buy
   it. It’s actually technological doping, but none the less it works and
   we’ve won a vast number of medals as a result of it.

   “You can’t do that in track and field athletics. You can’t do it in a
   team sport where the bounce of a ball can make the difference between
   success and failure.”

   De Vos’s remarks came in an hour-long lecture on elite performance,
   motivation, and leadership in the wake of London 2012.

   On Friday night, he said his comments were in response to a question
   from the audience and that he was not criticising other Olympic sports
   but merely pointing out the difference with athletics.

   “I made the point, and perhaps it was an ill-chosen phrase, that one of
   the reasons we do well in certain sports is perhaps because we have the
   financial wherewithal to achieve a level that others can’t.

   “There are some sports where certain well-applied financial modals can
   bring you a certain advantage. My point was that it doesn’t apply in
   athletics. It’s very, very hard to achieve that.”

   During the lecture, De Vos also turned his ire on the Education
   Secretary, Michael Gove, describing his policies on school sport as
   “stupid”.

   Criticising the Government for its failure to deliver an effective
   Olympic legacy in terms of school sport provision, De Vos said: “It’s
   not the place for political grandstanding but Michael Gove’s decision
   of two years ago to effectively take it off the curriculum for infants
   schools and make it an optional curriculum for junior schools seems to
   me the single-minded most stupid piece of dogma that has imposed upon
   anybody for a very, very long time.

   “I think they probably realise that by now and are finding it quite
   hard to back-rack from that position in the glory of the Games.”

   De Vos insisted on Friday night that he stood by his position. “I do
   think that,” he said.

   “I think it’s wrong because actually 20 or 30 years down the line, if
   we haven’t got active sport in schools we will suffer as a sporting
   nation.”

   De Vos’s lecture concluded with reflections on the performance of
   Britain’s track and field athletes at the London Olympics and he
   admitted that the euphoria of the gold rush on ‘Super Saturday’ had
   masked deficiencies in the rest of the squad.

   “Actually we didn’t have a great Games,” he said. “We had quite a bad
   Games. Things didn’t go the way we wanted it to. We didn’t get as many
   finalists as we wanted or as many personal bests as we wanted. There
   were some spectacular under-performances.

   “But actually, you know what, it didn’t mater because we’re so obsessed
   by the culture of celebrity and gold that 99 per cent of the population
   would go, ‘Athletics had an absolutely fantastic Games’.”

   government is poised to cheat the British people of the Brexit they
   voted for Credit: EPA/STEPHANIE LECOCQ

   When I heard that the government minister Lord Prior had told a meeting
   of tech and insurance leaders last week that they shouldn’t worry about
   barriers to entry for future employees from the EU, I thought he’d gone
   too far. How could a Brexit administration elected on a promise of
   reducing net migration to the tens of thousands tolerate such
   behaviour? Surely Lord Prior would be sacked?

   Instead, it got worse. A new Cabinet consensus around transitional
   arrangements has been unveiled. Under it, open borders will be
   maintained for a minimum of two years after we finally leave the EU in
   2019. Britain will have to wait until at least 2021 – five years after
   the Brexit referendum – to take back control....

Sex, divorce and infidelity: Meet the Muslim women bloggers tackling taboos

A new wave of Muslim female bloggers is tackling issues traditionally
considered taboo by their communities, and trying to shatter stereotypes
around their culture. Alia Waheed speaks to some of them

   By Alia Waheed

   8:00AM BST 14 Aug 2015

   At a time when the lens of the media is trained on the Muslim community
   like never before and it seems we read near-daily reports of teen girls
   fleeing the UK to marry Isil fighters, it’s strange how little we
   actually know about the lives of young, British Muslim women.

   That could be about to change.

   A growing number of Muslim female bloggers are now giving voice to
   their experience and challenging the misconceptions that exist, both
   within their own communities and society as a whole.

   After generations of having their voices silenced by their own culture,
   they now face a new challenge from organisations like Britain First - a
   BNP splinter group - who have attempted to hijack issues affecting
   Muslim women to further their own causes.

   What makes the phenomenon remarkable is that many of these bloggers are
   choosing to lift the veil of anonymity, in order to discuss issues that
   have been traditionally swept under the carpet for fear of a backlash
   from the community and to protect family honour.

   By talking openly about their personal experiences, they are succeeding
   in challenging taboos around subjects such as religion and sexuality,
   and redefining society's perception of what it is to be a Muslim woman.

   (centre), pictured with friends Woman believed to be female jihadis -
   this is how Muslim girls are often portrayed in the media  Photo: Tim
   Stewart News

   One reason for the sudden surge in Muslim female bloggers is technology
   – social media and blogging platforms give them control over their
   voices like never before.

   Another explanation is the growing confidence of Muslim women as
   individuals, at a time when there is an increasing sense of their
   community being under attack. This makes them want to assert their
   British identity more forcefully than ever before and this certainty
   around their nationality is giving them the confidence to explore
   deeper issues that stem from their dual cultural and religious
   heritage.

   While they are proud of it, they also see its faults - and are not
   afraid to challenge them.

   Maryam Din, whose blog ‘Five Pillars and Six Colours’ chronicles her
   experience of reconciling her religious, cultural and sexual identity -
   as a gay, Muslim feminist - tells me:

   “Social media is, on the whole, a safe space for me. It’s not very
   often that negativity penetrates that. However, much like in real life,
   there will be times when it happens. I've faced racism and Islamophobia
   from the non-Muslim community, and homophobia within the Muslim
   community. However, my experiences have largely been positive.

   “Muslim women are now being open about themselves and their lives
   because we've had enough, both from within and outside of the Muslim
   community and enough of being silenced.

   “Between the constant wave of Islamophobia across Europe and
   politicians thinking they’re trying to do what’s best for us, while not
   actually consulting us - like banning our cultural and religious dress
   in public - it isn't really difficult to see why there has been an
   upsurge of Muslim women speaking out.

   “These preconceived ideas about Muslim women aren't ever positive and
   are rife with a mixture of Islamophobia, racism and sexism. Blogs like
   mine challenge these misconceptions simply by existing.

   “In a world that sees Muslim women as oppressed and marginalised,
   visibility is a radical and political act, which unapologetically says
   we love who we are and what we stand for."

   Giving Muslim women an authentic voice was one of the reasons Mehreen
   Baig, a teacher from North London, decided against remaining anonymous
   when she began her blog, 'Queen Mehreen: Brown Girl Talks'.

   Her blog - which has more than 10,000 readers - ranges from humorous
   descriptions of the arranged marriage system and being considered left
   on the shelf at the grand age of 25; to sexual harassment at work and
   being judged for not wearing a hijab.

   “My blog started off as a diary of my feelings and frustrations,” she
   explains.

   “There are lots of issues that never get addressed, out of fear of
   judgement or because we don't have a platform to express ourselves. I
   was advised on numerous occasions to remain anonymous in case of any
   backlash.

   “My mum was scared that I was so honest and blunt with my opinions. But
   my blog represents my feelings. I feel no animosity toward anyone, nor
   am I inciting any hatred or disrespect. If I truly believe I’m not
   doing anything wrong, so I shouldn't have to hide.

   “My blogs are a voice for the young British Asian woman. To hide my
   identity would defeat the purpose of showing we are proud of how we
   feel and our experiences. Though I have received negative comments,
   they have been a minority and they have actually validated what my blog
   is talking about.

   "There has been huge media attention on the oppressed Muslim girl or
   the "Muslim girl gone bad" but these are stereotypes that most of us
   can't relate to. Where are the majority of us, the ones who are
   comfortable with being British and Muslim? I hope blogs like mine
   represent those women- the majority who are unfortunately the least
   visible."

   For many women bloggers, it’s also a therapeutic experience, albeit
   driven by the desire to empower other women. Laila Ali, 30, started her
   blog ‘Desi, Divorced and Damn Fabulous’, after discovering a lack of
   emotional support and information for Muslim women facing the end of
   their marriages, and to take a stand against the stigma associated with
   female divorcees.

   “I was hurting badly when I discovered my husband's infidelity. I
   searched for websites to try to connect with people who were in the
   same boat as me and found plenty about adultery and divorce, but none
   were directed towards a Muslim woman’s experience,” she says.

   “This prompted me to write about my circumstances. I realised that,
   while there had been no helpful information available to me, perhaps
   through writing about my own experience it might helps someone else.

   “We are tired of being told how to behave. This was one of the most
   heart-wrenching moments of my life yet we [divorcees] are considered
   'unclassy' or 'a woman scorned' for even existing, let alone talking
   about it.

   “I won’t pretend five years of my life didn't exist. Everything that
   has happened has shaped me into the person I am now. Though blog is
   quite open at criticising the Muslim community, on the flipside, it
   does show that Muslim woman are strong, we won't be broken.”
