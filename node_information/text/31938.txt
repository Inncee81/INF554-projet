Apple Shares Another Teaser for M. Night Shyamalan Apple TV+ Series 'Servant'

   Thursday October 3, 2019 6:02 pm PDT by Juli Clover
   Apple today shared a new teaser trailer for its upcoming TV show
   "Servant," which is a psychological thriller created by Tony Basgallop
   and executive produced by M. Night Shyamalan.
   The series is said to follow a Philadelphia couple (played by Tony
   Kebbell and Lauren Ambrose) who hire a young nanny named Leanne (Nell
   Tiger Free) to care for their newborn child, who, based on the
   trailers, appears to be a fake baby.

   IFRAME: //www.youtube.com/embed/lnYIcec-Ofk

   The new teaser trailer is one of three that Apple has shown so far,
   with the others previewed during the Emmy Awards in September.

   IFRAME: //www.youtube.com/embed/__-M5gA3pIU

   Servant will not be available when Apple TV+ launches on November 1,
   but it will be coming out soon after on November 28. Apple TV+ will be
   priced at $4.99 per month, but Apple is offering a free subscription to
   customers who purchase an Apple TV, iPhone, iPad, or Mac.
   At launch, Apple TV+ will offer several TV shows, including
   "Dickinson," "For All Mankind," "Helpsters," "Ghostwriter," and "The
   Morning Show."

   M Night didnt write this, he just produced it according to the full
   article.
   I didn’t realize that. Thought he was the writer as well.
   I’d guess he slipped Philadelphia into it though. :)

   Like his movies or not, I appreciate that he sets most of his stories
   in Philadelphia (where he’s from). Much like Stephen King and Maine.

       iPhone 11 vs iPhone 11 Pro
       Apple is separating the new smartphones into its usual low-cost
       versus high-cost categories, with big differences between the two
       models coming down to the camera, display, and battery life.

Tim Cook Talks Cryptocurrency, Quality Journalism, Privacy and More on
European Tour

   Thursday October 3, 2019 5:01 pm PDT by Juli Clover
   Apple CEO Tim Cook is currently in Europe, and over the course of the
   last few days, he's visited Germany, France, and Italy. Earlier this
   week we shared an interview he did with a German news site, and today
   he spoke with a French newspaper and students in Italy as part of an
   appearance at the Osservatorio Permanente.
   Cook commented on topics like journalism, privacy, and immigration,
   with his comments shared by Italian site Macitynet.it [Google
   Translate] and French newspaper Les Echoes (via CNBC).

                     Image shared by Tim Cook on Twitter

   According to Cook, while the internet has brought "many positive
   things," fake news is one negative. From a translation of the original
   interview:

     All of us lovers of democracy and freedom must think that separating
     the false from the true is the basis of freedom. Quality journalism
     is the foundation of every democracy and an open and free press is
     essential.

   Cook also spoke about a topic that he's covered many times in the past
   - privacy. He reiterated his belief that Apple customers are not
   Apple's product, and that Apple will not sell customer data. "At Apple,
   we will never treat you as products but as customers with dignity and
   respect," he said.
   Along with touching on privacy, Cook highlighted Apple's environmental
   efforts, such as the fact that Apple is run on 100 percent renewable
   energy, and he spoke on human rights. "We do not do it because it's
   required by regulations, but because it is a moral imperative," he
   said.
   Apple supports immigration because wealthy countries must "accept
   migrants who are fleeing difficult situations," said Cook. Cook added
   that he would like for young people and children to be able to stay in
   the United States to study, referencing his support for DACA, or the
   Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals immigration policy.
   Cook had advice for students regarding smartphone usage. "Smartphones
   must bring you closer to those who are far away - don't leave those
   close to you," he said. "If you spend more time looking at your
   smartphones than people's eyes, you're wrong."
   Cook also spoke about cryptocurrency according to CNBC, with statements
   originally shared by French site Les Echoes. Cook said that currency
   should stay in the hands of countries, and private companies should not
   look to gain power with cryptocurrency.

     "No. I really think that a currency should stay in the hands of
     countries. I'm not comfortable with the idea of a private group
     setting up a competing currency," he said.
     "A private company shouldn't be looking to gain power this way."

   Apple's vice president of Apple Pay Jennifer Bailey recently said that
   Apple is "watching" cryptocurrency in regards to potentially supporting
   it in the future, but said that the company is primarily focused on
   what consumers are using today.
   Cook's comments come three months after Facebook announced plans to
   launch a new digital currency called Libra next year in partnership
   with companies like Visa, Mastercard, Paypal, and Stripe.

   topic, the discussion thread is located in our Politics, Religion,
   Social Issues forum. All forum members and site visitors are welcome to

   Remember when Steve Jobs did rare interviews and he’d talk about Apple,
   the Mac, the iPod and iPhone? I loved that. But more importantly, he
   loved that. And he was right about Apple and he knew what he was
   talking about. I like Cook, but his opinion on those topics is
   genuinely worth no more than yours or mines. Only difference is if he
   cares about immigration he can save money in Apples operations...

   Typical. Timmy goes to Europe or sendout screeds here at home lecturing
   on privacy but happily gets on his knees & shuts up when he goes to
   Beijing...
   "Quality journalism" - translation: If it promotes a far-left liberal
   agenda and suppresses conservative speech then it's quality journalism
   Timmy needs to be removed asap

   I recall Steve Jobs sitting on a humble wooden stool, wearing the same
   outfit he had worn for a decade, drilling the concept of his products
   into the minds of those willing to listen on the various media outlets.
   His passion and love for revolution and his obsession for chasing that
   perfect solution to real product problems was what got Apple moving in
   the right direction after years of management creating a sleeping
   beast.
   Tim likes his steel, glass and stone fortresses ... his expensive
   wooden boxes in his Apple Groves ... and his big political ideas. He
   likes his incredible pipeline that we've heard about for the greater
   portion of a decade. He likes his profits on evolutionary products, his
   large salary and his huge bonus. Tim, why not let the ship sail with
   fresh leadership equally obsessed with product innovation as Jobs, and
   take on the role of a full time politician?
   Yours Truly,
   Everybody.

   Hello! The federal reserve is a privately run with unelected officials
   controlling the money.
   I was literally coming here to say this. The “Federal” Reserve is not
   government. The name is a nice disguise, though.

   I believe people with power and influence (being CEO of one of the
   largest companies in the world gives you a lot of influence) should
   always try and make something good for the world.
   Steve Jobs was a great CEO, and a visionary product wise. But I would
   have loved to see Steve Jobs showing more care for other kind of
   things, like Bill Gates. What he is trying to do with his foundation,
   is amazing.
   EDIT:
   As CEOs, both Steve Jobs and Bill Gates were amazing. As innovators and
   marketeers, Jobs definitely had the advantage. But as a human being, I
   do believe Bill Gates is one of the best. And Tim Cook, in his own way,
   is trying to do something more than just being a CEO.

   Astonished that some people still don't understand how interviews work;
   ie the interviewer asks questions, prompting the interviewee to respond
   with answers to the questions asked.

Apple May Have Acquired Motion Capture Company IKinema

   Thursday October 3, 2019 2:59 pm PDT by Juli Clover
   Apple may have recently acquired UK-based motion capture company
   IKinema, based on evidence from company filings and information shared
   by a MacRumors reader.
   IKinema offers animation technology that's used for games, virtual
   reality, and more. Earlier this year, for example, IKinema partnered
   with Ubisoft for IKinema's RunTime software for character creation.
   IKinema specialized in technology that allowed for real-time motion
   animation of virtual characters.

     IKINEMA's technology is embraced by development teams the world over
     to bring their games to life through delivery of high fidelity
     results in natural character locomotion and greater player immersion
     within dynamic game worlds, including substantial cost reduction and
     accelerated production levels by a factor of five times or more to
     expedite the release of games to market.

   Based on details from IKinema's mostly defunct website, the company
   considers itself a specialist in real-time procedural animation and
   whole body solving technology. IKinema has several videos on YouTube
   showing off its technology creating animated characters from real-life
   people, dogs, and more.

   IFRAME: //www.youtube.com/embed/849vDheMyXs

   According to a document filed with the UK government, Apple lawyer
   Peter Denwood, who handles Apple's international affairs, was named the
   director of IKinema on September 12, 2019, with his address listed as
   One Apple Park Way.
   The address of the company was also updated to 100 New Bridge Street in
   London on September 26, which is the address for Apple Europe Limited.
   The IKinema website is no longer functional with the exception of a few
   technical documents, and the company's Twitter and Facebook accounts
   stopped being updated on August 19. MacRumors reader Peter, who is in
   the industry, told MacRumors that IKinema customers have been left in
   the dark "for weeks" and that the acquisition was confirmed in a
   private Facebook Motion Capture group this morning.
   It's not clear what Apple will do with IKinema's technology, but Apple
   has delved into games with Apple Arcade, though the company does not
   develop its own game technology at this time.
   Apple is also rumored to be working on various virtual and augmented
   reality projects, which could potentially benefit from IKinema's
   software, as could Animoji and Memoji, which animate based on facial
   expressions using the TrueDepth camera system.

   One of these days, Apple will acquire IKEA, and rename it iKea. The
   prices of everything they sell will skyrocket, but on the plus size,
   the furniture and housewares will get thinner and thinner.
   The Apple iTorp 3S+ sofa group will have a triple-lens camera system,
   and be only a foot wide. Will make it tough to sit on, and as it will
   be made mostly of glass, it will be fairly fragile, but GOD will it
   take fantastic selfies, even in low light! AND it will be able to
   connect wirelessly to the internet!
   Only $4,278.95 with 6GB of CLSDDR4 RAM... (Chaise Lounge Sofa Double
   Data Rate 4th generation Random Access Memory,) and 32GB storage for
   the base model. Of course, what Apple won’t tell you is that
   furnitureOS takes 28GB of storage to work. Never mind why a SOFA needs
   RAM...
   I could be wrong, but it would be really funny. The alternative is that
   IKEA gets a BUNCH of money from somewhere and buys Apple. The next
   year, they announce the new iPhøn, which you have to assemble yourself
   from 178 individual parts, and the instructions are of course, almost
   free of words, just pictographs showing someone with REALLY tiny hands
   putting things together, and the obligatory sketch of someone with
   GIANT hands, (by which I mean regular-sized hands,) on a frustrated
   person, unable to even pick up or hold the tiny bits, smiling while
   calling customer service for help, and customer service sending a tiny
   little pixie of a person in a blue-striped, yellow colored IKEA
   uniform, over to assist the customer.
   For a fee, of course.
   That was a lot of effort for very little reward.

   I just bought ones, they’re pretty good, Im a freelancer developer,
   they’re great for taking calls and for switching between iPhone/Mac, I
   can be making lunch or dinner, skip songs, call someone throw siri,
   without using my hands and with the phone charging upstairs. It’s not
   perfect and not exactly cheap but they’re great nonetheless.

   London on September 26, which is the address for Apple Europe Limited.
   The IKinema website is no longer functional with the exception of a few
   technical documents, and the company's Twitter and Facebook accounts
   stopped being updated on August 19. A MacRumors reader in the industry
   told MacRumors that IKinema customers have been left in the dark "for
   weeks" and that the acquisition was confirmed in a private Facebook
   Motion Capture group this morning.
   It's not clear what Apple will do with IKinema's technology, but Apple
   has delved into games with Apple Arcade, though the company does not
   develop its own game technology at this time.
   Apple is also rumored to be working on various virtual and augmented
   reality projects, which could potentially benefit from IKinema's
   software, as could Animoji and Memoji, which animate based on facial
   expressions using the TrueDepth camera system.
   Article Link: Apple May Have Acquired Motion Capture Company IKinema
   ('https://www.macrumors.com/2019/10/03/apple-acquisition-ikinema/')
   One of these days, Apple will acquire IKEA, and rename it iKea. The
   prices of everything they sell will skyrocket, but on the plus size,
   the furniture and housewares will get thinner and thinner.
   The Apple iTorp 3S+ sofa group will have a triple-lens camera system,
   and be only a foot wide. Will make it tough to sit on, and as it will
   be made mostly of glass, it will be fairly fragile, but GOD will it
   take fantastic selfies, even in low light! AND it will be able to
   connect wirelessly to the internet!
   Only $4,278.95 with 6GB of CLSDDR4 RAM... (Chaise Lounge Sofa Double
   Data Rate 4th generation Random Access Memory,) and 32GB storage for
   the base model. Of course, what Apple won’t tell you is that
   furnitureOS takes 28GB of storage to work. Never mind why a SOFA needs
   RAM...
   I could be wrong, but it would be really funny. The alternative is that
   IKEA gets a BUNCH of money from somewhere and buys Apple. The next
   year, they announce the new iPhøn, which you have to assemble yourself
   from 178 individual parts, and the instructions are of course, almost
   free of words, just pictographs showing someone with REALLY tiny hands
   putting things together, and the obligatory sketch of someone with
   GIANT hands, (by which I mean regular-sized hands,) on a frustrated
   person, unable to even pick up or hold the tiny bits, smiling while
   calling customer service for help, and customer service sending a tiny
   little pixie of a person in a blue-striped, yellow colored IKEA
   uniform, over to assist the customer.
   For a fee, of course.

Apple Seeds macOS Catalina Golden Master to Developers

   Thursday October 3, 2019 10:07 am PDT by Juli Clover
   Apple today seeded the golden master version of macOS 10.15 Catalina to
   developers, three days after seeding the tenth macOS Catalina beta and
   over three months after the new Mac operating system update was first
   unveiled at the Worldwide Developers Conference.
   The golden master version of macOS Catalina represents the final
   version of the update that will be provided to the public at release.
   The new macOS Catalina software can be downloaded using the Software
   Update mechanism in System Preferences after installing the proper
   profile from the Developer Center.
   macOS Catalina eliminates the iTunes app, splitting it into Music,
   Podcasts, and TV apps. The three new apps offer similar functionality
   to iTunes, but are split up by feature. iOS device management is still
   available on the Mac, but it's now done through the Finder rather than
   iTunes.
   With a new Sidecar feature, you can turn your iPad into a second
   display for your Mac with just the click of a button. The Apple Pencil
   works with Sidecar, so you can turn your iPad into a drawing tablet in
   apps like Photoshop and Illustrator.
   Your Apple Watch can be used to approve security prompts for passwords
   and other info in macOS Catalina, and Macs with a T2 chip now support
   Activation Lock, making them more secure. There's a new Find My that
   brings the Find My Mac app to the Mac for the first time and even lets
   you track your devices when they're offline, or, in the case of
   notebooks, closed.
   Screen Time is available on the Mac as well as iOS devices, and Project
   Catalyst, a new Apple initiative, will let developers easily port their
   iPad apps over to the Mac to increase the number of Mac apps available.
   There's a new Photos interface that surfaces your best photos organized
   by day, month, or year, there's a new start page in Safari, Mail has
   new tools for muting email threads and blocking senders, and the
   Reminders app has been overhauled.
   32-bit apps no longer work in macOS Catalina, which is something to be
   aware of before installing the beta.
   For more details on macOS Catalina, make sure to check out our macOS
   Catalina roundup. Apple is planning to release macOS Catalina sometime
   in October.

   This may well be at least that bad. Apple is intentionally breaking
   software that millions of people rely on.
   Dropping 32 bit support is inexcusable. I'm anticipating my phone
   ringing off the hook in the weeks after release with people needing me
   to remove 10.15 and reinstall 10.14.
   I'm disabling automatic macOS updates on every machine I touch. Almost
   nobody in the real world is ready for this.
   And what's worse, I've got it running on a test machine, have had it
   for months now. It doesn't add anything useful. Other than broken
   software and the inexplicable System Preferences rearrange, it's almost
   indistinguishable from 10.14.
   Oh, so you're one of those people.
   You probably said the same thing when Mac OS X Lion dropped Power PC
   apps. The real world isn't ready for it. Well, if they are not ready
   now, they will be soon. Apple Has been moving to 64 bit for the last 14
   years. I am surprised its taken them this long. They probably have been
   thinking about dropping 32 bit apps since Yosemite. Just be happy those
   apps were supported for this long, and move on.
   Every year we get people like you, especially when there is a big
   change. People who stood by Mac OS X Tiger, and said that Leopard would
   never replace it.
   Same with Snow Leopard, and Mavericks. But the world has moved on
   People will move on from Mojave and 32 bit apps eventually.
   Just you wait when Apple moves away from Intel CPUs. You will be all up
   in arms.
   FYI, there are plenty of changes, including the split up of iTunes
   without removing any features, the ability to use an iPad as a display,
   and several others.
   Just because the interface is extremely similar to Mojave does not mean
   that it is the same.

   […]
   Come on - Apple started the transition to 64 Bit in 2005 with Mac OS X
   10.4 Tiger. That was 14 years ago - I'd say any developer who had only
   the slightest intention to keep his code up to date had plenty of time
   to do so …

   People like this confuse me. There's a platform that offers 34 years of
   ABI compatibility: Windows. It's a more popular platform and cheaper
   too. A platform that guarantees you can stay on the same OS version for
   10 years while remaining secure and supported.
   I don't know why people go out of their way to choose a platform that
   has removed technical cruft, at the expense of breaking legacy
   software, for literally it's entire existence. A platform that has
   major API deprecations and removals yearly. Then go complain about it.

   I don't think any OS can compare to that disaster :rolleyes:
   It really wasn't a bad OS. 3rd party drivers and Intel pushing a
   recycled chipset that maxed out at (IIRC) 1gb of RAM were the biggest
   issues. nVidia specifically was responsible for over 50% of crashes at
   one point, and OEMs selling laptops with the minimum amount of RAM were
   another headache.
   On a proper laptop (like a MBP, ironically) and without bloatware,
   Vista was a rather good OS at launch. File IO was a tad slow, but it
   was otherwise reliable.
   Case in point: Windows 7 was mostly just a service pack and UI facelift
   for Vista.
   Edit: I've been corrected. The chipset issue was that it didn't "the
   Intel 915 GPU doesn't support WVDDM, which was required for Vista
   certification." Thanks [USER=995807]WaruiKoohii[/USER]. That's how you
   ended up with Vista ready vs Vista compatible issue too.

   Maybe to you, but the XCode tools for SwiftUI and Catalyst apps are the
   biggest change in macOS for years pertinent to enterprise development.

Kuo: Apple to Launch 'iPhone SE 2' in Early 2020 With Similar Design as
iPhone 8, A13 Chip, and 3GB RAM

   Thursday October 3, 2019 6:27 am PDT by Joe Rossignol
   Apple plans to release a lower-priced "iPhone SE 2" in the first
   quarter of 2020, according to noted analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.
   In a research note with TF International Securities, obtained by
   MacRumors, Kuo said the device will feature a similar form factor
   design and specifications as the iPhone 8, with a faster A13 chip and
   3GB of RAM:

     We forecast that Apple will launch the more affordable iPhone SE2 in
     1Q20. For the most part, the form factor design and hardware spec
     are similar to iPhone 8's. The most significant hardware spec
     upgrade will be the adoption of the A13 processor and 3GB LPDDR4X.
     iPhone SE2 will likely increase iPhone's market share and benefit
     Apple's promotions for service and content. We expect that the
     iPhone SE2 shipment will reach 30–40mn units in 2020.

   Kuo believes the "iPhone SE 2" will be the "best upgrade choice" for an
   estimated 100 million remaining iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus users,
   serving as a "key growth driver" for Apple in 2020. He believes these
   customers have low desire for new features like Face ID and multiple
   cameras, suggesting the "iPhone SE 2" will stick with Touch ID and a
   single-lens rear camera.
   Kuo's prediction lines up with multiple other sources that have claimed
   Apple plans to release a new lower-cost iPhone 8-esque device next
   year, including the Taiwanese publication Economic Daily News, Japanese
   publication Nikkei Asian Review, and Bloomberg's Mark Gurman and Debby
   Wu.
   Those earlier reports indicated the device will sport a 4.7-inch
   display and a Touch ID home button like the iPhone 8. Apple continues
   to sell the iPhone 8 from $449, while the iPhone SE was $349 prior to
   being discontinued. When new, the iPhone 8 and iPhone SE started at
   $699 and $399 respectively.

   they should have gone with the smaller enclosure like the iphone SE and
   then edge to edge which would give large display in small enclosure.
   If the SE people wanted a iPhone 8 sized SE, they would likely have
   bought an iphone 7/8.

   It has always seemed a bit weird to me that Apple seems to assume
   buyers of small phones are looking for something other than a premium
   experience. Why not make something in a format similar to the existing
   SE, but with an edge-to-edge screen?

   Now you people can finally shut up.

   SE fans should rejoice.
   I feel like comments like these miss what people, at least those I
   speak to, like about the SE...the fact that it’s small, not that it’s
   cheap! An SE based on an iPhone 8 is just a cheap big iPhone. If I
   wanted that I’d buy the iPhone 8 that’s already on the market.

   It's astounding that:
   [LIST=1]
   * Apple still doesn't get why people loved SE.
   * People here still don't get it as well.
   Apple thinks that SE is a phone for those on the budget. A lot of
   people here probably agree.. What SE fans wanted was a SMALL, premium
   phone. iPhone 8 form factor is NOT small. That's why we complain. Just
   go to previous articles and try to find one SE fan saying: man, I wish
   they did SE in 8 form factor. Nobody EVER said that.

   Don't desecrate the good name of the SE with a iPhone 8 based phone!!
   :'(
   That being said... I'd probably eventually get one to replace my SE.
   Wouldn't be as good or ideal but better than other options.

   So it would be better than iPhone 8, but with a similar design. What's
   the point in having both? If they just want to sell a "cheap" iPhone
   they can cut the price of 8 and call it a day.
   It would be great to have a true SE 2, either with the old chassis or
   with a new notch design with a smaller display.

   Yes, we will still complain. We want a small phone with new upgrades.
   The 8 form factor is still too big for many of us who prefer the 5S/SE.
   So you can keep your ****** comments to yourself.
