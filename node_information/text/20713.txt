   The NVIDIA® Isaac Software Development Kit (SDK) is a developer toolbox
   for accelerating the development and deployment of AI-powered robots.
   The SDK includes the Isaac Robot Engine, packages with high-performance
   robotics algorithms, hardware reference applications and powerful
   simulation platform, Isaac Sim. The SDK accelerates robot development
   for manufacturers, researchers and startups by making it easier to add
   Artificial Intelligence (AI) for perception and navigation into modern
   day robots.

   Isaac SDK capabilities:
     * Deep neural networks and GPU accelerated algorithms for robotics.
     * Develop in simulation and deploy easily in reality.
     * Integration of NVIDIA AI capabilities for robotic applications.
     * Easy bring up of sensors used for robotics applications.
     * Visualization of robot development in real and virtual worlds.
     * Interface with robotic platforms such as cobots (collaborative
       robots), AMRs (autonomous mobile robots), and other
       service/industrial robots.

ROBOT ENGINE

   The Isaac Robot Engine is a software framework to easily build modular
   robotics applications. It enables high-performance data processing and
   deep learning for intelligent robots. Robotics applications developed
   on Isaac Robot Engine can seamlessly run on edge devices like the
   NVIDIA® Jetson AGX Xavier™ and NVIDIA® Jetson Nano™, as well as on a
   workstation with a discrete NVIDIA® GPU.

   Entity-Component Architecture
     * The Robot Engine allows developers to break down a complex robotics
       use case into smaller building blocks.
     * Customize Isaac SDK features to fit your use case by configuring
       pre-packaged components.
     * Easily add new features by developing custom components.
     * Other capabilities include experimental message recording and
       replay of sensor data or message passing over network sockets.

   Computational Graph
     * Applications consist of multiple nodes and use inter-node
       communication to exchange data between them.
     * Avoid host-device memory copies and increase the performance of
       your application by attaching CUDA buffer objects to messages.
     * Group nodes into subgraphs and effectively combine them into a
       robotics application.

   Visualization
     * The Isaac Robot Engine also comes with a customizable visualization
       framework to create visualization for variable plots, drawings,
       camera image overlays, or 3D scenes.
     * Developers can use Isaac WebSight to inspect and debug their
       robotics application in a web browser.

   Advanced Build System
     * Isaac SDK uses Bazel for tracking dependencies, building source
       code, testing and packaging of robotics applications.
     * Automatically pull external dependencies such as OpenCV, ROS or
       other robotics open source libraries.
     * Partners can create their own workspaces to add sensor support or
       new algorithms to Isaac SDK. An example is available on GitHub

     * Introducing distributed workspaces for Isaac SDK users and partners
       to create compatible, easily manageable workspaces and contribute
       to the growing Isaac community. Velodyne Lidar example available.
       Get the example from Isaac GitHub repository.

GEMS

   GEMS are modular capabilities for sensing, planning, or actuation that
   can be easily plugged into a robotics application. For example,
   developers can add obstacle detection, stereo depth estimation, or
   human speech recognition to enrich their robot use cases. Similarly,
   developers can use the Isaac navigation stack, a collection of modules
   to build a robotics navigation stack, to their robot. GEMS capabilities
   currently supported by Isaac SDK:

   Perception
     * Stereo Depth, Stereo Visual Odometry, Object/AprilTag Detection,
       Path Seg DNN, CUDA Orb, Superpixels

   Navigation
     * Lidar based Global Localization, LQR Path Planning, Support for
       non-circular robot bases

   IX - Human Machine Interaction
     * Audio Keyword Detection

   Robot Platforms
     * Segway RMP210

   Sensors
     * Stereo Camera, Structured Light Depth Camera, Velodyne VLP16 lidar,
       IMU

                               [isaacgems.jpg]

                        What's New for GEMS in 2019.2

     * New capabilities for perception tasks:
          + Path Segmentation DNN
          + CUDA ORB Features
          + CUDA Superpixels
     * New navigation capability with support for non-circular robot bases
     * New sensor support for Livox Lidar
     __________________________________________________________________

Isaac SIM

   Isaac Sim is a virtual robotics laboratory and a high-fidelity 3D world
   simulator. It accelerates research, design, and development in robotics
   by reducing cost and risk. Developers can quickly and easily train and
   test their robots in detailed, highly realistic scenarios.

   Developers can use virtual robots with simulated sensors (RGB, stereo,
   depth, segmentation, LIDAR, IMU) in Isaac Sim to test their
   applications in a high-fidelity simulation environment. Once tested,
   applications can be deployed to NVIDIA® Jetson AGX Xavier™, Jetson™TX2,
   or Jetson Nano™ running on physical robots.

   Robots in Isaac Sim are tightly coupled to the tools and frameworks in
   Isaac SDK, enabling easy transfer of algorithms and data between
   physical and virtual robots.

Game Engines Supported

     * Unreal Engine
     * Unity 3D

Domain Randomization

   Using synthetic data and controlling the randomization parameters in a
   scene, developers can create huge customized data sets. In Isaac Sim,
   developers can seamlessly randomize lighting, object materials, object
   colors, object poses and camera properties.
   [isaac-sim-domain_randomization_small.png]

Robot Builder

   The most common robot model is URDF. Isaac Sim has an embedded URDF
   loader which allows you to load the URDF model of your robot into Isaac
   Sim and simulate its joints and movements. The URDF models for several
   mobile bases and manipulators have been tested in Isaac Sim.

                     What's New for Simulation in 2019.2

     * Introducing Isaac Sim support for Unity 3D Game Engine, popular for
       building scenarios without the need for in-house 3D expertise.

Jetson Developer Tools

NVIDIA JetPack™

   The latest NVIDIA JetPack bundles all of the developer tools required
   to develop for the Jetson platform, including system profiler, graphics
   debugger, and the CUDA Toolkit.

Nsight Systems

   Nsight Systems is a low overhead system-wide profiling tool, providing
   the insights developers need to analyze and optimize software
   performance. It uses GPU tracing, CPU sampling and tracing, and OS
   thread state tracing to visualize an application’s algorithms, helping
   developers identify the largest opportunities to optimize their code.

Nsight Graphics

   Tegra Graphics Debugger is a console-grade tool that allows you to
   debug and optimize your OpenGL and OpenGL ES applications, enabling you
   to get the latest, most advanced GPU features with the Jetson platform.

CUDA Toolkit

   CUDA Toolkit provides a development environment for creating
   high-performance GPU-accelerated applications, and includes all the
   necessary debugging and optimization tools.

                          Learn More about JetPack

Included in CUDA Toolkit:

NVIDIA Nsight Eclipse Edition

   Nsight Eclipse Edition is a full-featured IDE powered by the Eclipse
   platform. It provides an all-in-one integrated environment to edit,
   cross-compile, and debug CUDA-C applications. Nsight Eclipse Edition
   supports a rich set of commercial and free plugins.

CUDA GDB

   CUDA-GDB is a command line tool that delivers a seamless debugging
   experience allowing you to debug both the CPU and GPU portions of your
   application simultaneously.

CUDA MEMCHECK

   CUDA-MEMCHECK is a command line tool that detects the source and cause
   of memory access errors in your GPU code. CUDA-MEMCHECK also reports
   runtime execution errors, identifying situations that could otherwise
   result in an “unspecified launch failure” error when your application
   is running.

CUDA nvprof

   nvprof is a command line tool that enables you to collect and view
   profiling data, i.e., a timeline of CUDA-related activities on both CPU
   and GPU.

Nsight Compute

   Nsight Compute is an interactive kernel profiler for CUDA applications.
   It runs on your Linux host computer and provides detailed performance
   metrics for analysis and enables results comparison between baselines
   and the current run. Nsight Compute can be extended with analysis
   scripts for post-processing results. Also included is a command line
   tool that can be run on your Jetson system or on your Linux host
   computer.
