   Is your iPhone getting blown up with spammy messages? Then you should
   probably update to iOS 13 if you haven’t already. iOS 13 includes a
   couple of new tools for blocking junk emails and robocalls, and carries
   over the iMessage blocking options from iOS 12. These make it easy to
   filter out unwanted messages at the source—whether from specific
   contacts or en masse. Even better, any numbers or email addresses you
   block from an iPhone will be blocked on your other Apple devices as
   well. Here’s how:

Blocking unwanted email

    1. First, you can block specific contacts from the iOS Mail app by
       opening a message and tapping the sender’s email address. Tap
       “Block This Contact” button.
    2. Next, go to Settings > Mail and turn on “Ignore Blocked Senders.”
    3. You can also go to Settings > Mail > Blocked to add to/manage your
       list of blocked contacts.

Blocking unknown callers

   Go to Settings > phone and turn on “Silence Unknown Callers.” This
   disables ringing and notifications for calls from unknown numbers which
   should cut down on spam and robocalls, but be aware this could also
   block important calls from numbers you don’t have saved. It would be
   smart to turn this off if you’re expecting an important phone call from
   a number you don’t know or don’t have saved.

Blocking iMessage contacts

   While you’ve technically been able to block contacts in iMessage since
   iOS 12, the method for blocking is quite similar to blocking email
   addresses and phone numbers. Under Settings > Messages, turn on “Filter
   unknown senders.” Just be mindful that this will prevent you from
   seeing messages from all unknown senders, much like when blocking
   unknown numbers, so be careful about when you have this setting
   enabled, and be sure to check your folder of filtered messages if
   you’re expecting to hear from someone.

   Phone Spam

   It’s the Year of the Robocall, it seems. I haven’t noticed this
   directly, but a number of friends, colleagues, and internet posters
   seem to be inundated with bullshit phone calls now more than ever
   before. What great times we live in, where anyone with an auto-dialer
   can blast out millions of calls to people who don’t want to hear about
   scammy vacation offers or other nonsense.

   While we all wait for STIR and SHAKEN certificates to take off, you
   should take a few moments to make sure you’ve done everything you can
   to prevent robocalls from reaching you. It’s a Sisyphean task, but you
   have to stay on top of it—for your sanity. Here are a few of our
   suggestions:

There’s an app for that

   There are plenty of apps you can use to block phone calls, which
   typically work by identifying spammy numbers others have already been
   hit with and preemptively blocking them before it’s your turn. They
   aren’t perfect, but they offer a reasonable first line of defense
   against annoyances.

   Advertisement

   I’ve been a huge fan of Hiya (Android, iOS) for years, as I’ve found
   its free version does a solid job of keeping the robocalls down. Make
   sure you’re updating its database at regular intervals (as in, whenever
   you get an annoying call or two), and make sure you’ve set up the app
   so that it’s automatically blocking problematic numbers and “neighbor
   scams,” or spoofed numbers that look a lot like your number, instead of
   just warning you about them.

   Phone Spam

   I also like WideProtect and Mr. Number for iOS and Android,
   respectively, which lets you block numbers beginning with whatever
   prefixes you want. If you’re getting a lot of calls from an area code
   that isn’t yours, and you don’t know anyone with that number, just
   block the whole thing.

   You can also try paying for apps like Robokiller, which might work well
   for you, but I’d give the free options a shot, first. It’s annoying to
   have to pay a monthly fee to not be annoyed.

   Advertisement

Check your wireless carrier for spam-blocking features

   If your wireless carrier offers free spam identification and blocking
   features or apps, there’s no harm in giving them a shot. These features
   might not work very well, but they’re better than nothing:
     * Verizon ($2.99/mo)
     * AT&T (Free)
     * T-Mobile (Free-$4/mo)
     * Sprint ($2.99/mo)

Try that “Do Not Call” Registry, but don’t get your hopes up

   Sure, you can sign up for the Federal Trade Commission’s “Do Not Call”
   registry, but you’re still going to get spammed. We’ve reached the
   point where it’s easier for scammers to blast out phone numbers and
   either not get caught, or get such positive results that getting caught
   isn’t much of a deterrent. Either way, this registry exists, and you
   can sign up for it—since even a placebo can help you feel better—but
   don’t get stressed out when it doesn’t work.

   Advertisement

   Oh, and while you’re there, feel free to file some complaints about
   spam calls you receive. They probably won’t do anything, either, but
   doing so might improve your mood slightly. If you’re getting spam
   texts, forward those to #7726.

Whitelist Your Contacts

   If you’re an iOS user, you can take the somewhat-extreme step of using
   Do Not Disturb as a sort-of whitelist for your iPhone. Pull up the
   Settings app and tap on Do Not Disturb. Flip it on, don’t give it a
   schedule (since you’re just going to leave it on), and tap the “Allow
   Calls From” section to select “All Contacts.” You’ve now effectively
   silenced all phone calls save for those from the people already in your
   iPhone’s Contacts app. However, you also won’t receive message
   notifications or app notifications—like your email—which can be
   problematic.

   Advertisement

   You can use the same trick on Android (via Settings > Sound > Do Not
   Disturb), and you have a lot more control over the kinds of
   notifications you want to receive. In other words, you can keep getting
   notifications about messages, events, and reminders, but block incoming
   calls unless they’re from people on your contact list. While you’re at
   it, don’t forget to flip on Android’s built-in caller ID & spam
   feature.

   Phone Spam

   For a more robust solution, install the app Tasker and try using this
   Redditor’s ingenious plug-in, which pushes all calls to voicemail
   unless they’re in your smartphone’s contacts. (You can also try
   creating your own, a skill worth learning!)

Consider switching to Google Voice

   Google is more than happy to give you a free phone number. While
   signing up for one isn’t going to stop spam calls from blowing up your
   phone, giving this out as your new primary number instead of your real
   phone number might help you lessen the load a bit—especially if you use
   Google Voice’s call screening and forwarding features. If you see that
   your Google Voice number is calling you, but the caller doesn’t
   announce who they are when you pick up, you’re probably safe to send
   that one to voicemail.

If You Just Bought a New Apple Device, You Get Free Apple TV+

   Nick Douglas
   Yesterday 3:15pm
   Filed to:TV

   If you bought a new iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Apple TV, or Mac after
   September 10 this year, then you can get a free year of Apple TV+
   (normally $5/month). The streaming service launches November 1, after
   which you’ll have three months to activate your free year in the Apple
   TV app. (If you buy a new device after November 1, you’ll have three
   months from the purchase date to activate.)

   TV+ launches with a slate of original shows and films, including The
   Morning Show, which is like ... daytime Newsroom? See more trailers on
   Apple’s site.

   Advertisement

   After your free year, TV+ will auto-renew for a month at $5. To cancel
   without missing some of your free subscription, set a calendar alert
   for a couple of days before your free year runs out, and include a link
   to the cancellation page.

   If you already intended to pay for the streaming service, then consider
   this a $60 discount on a device purchase. On the $150 Apple TV, that’s
   actually a consideration. But don’t use this to justify a new iPhone.

   Details for the deal are available on the Apple TV+ page and in this
   PDF.

I'm Josh Ocampo, Lifehacker Staff Writer, and This Is How I Work

   Josh Ocampo
   Today 10:00am
   Filed to:how we work

   Every week, we share the shortcuts, workspaces, and productivity tips
   of our favorite experts. This week, we’re going behind the scenes at
   Lifehacker. I’m Josh Ocampo, and this is how I work.

   Location: Manhattan
   Current Gig: Staff writer at Lifehacker
   Current mobile device: iPhone X
   Current computer: MacBook Pro at home
   One word that best describes how you work: Caffeinated

First of all, tell us a little about your background and how you got to where
you are today.

   My first job out of college was on the business side of a record label,
   handling payments and contracts. I got laid off, and on a whim got a
   job in the legal department of a magazine publisher. I worked my way
   into the business side of a few magazines—which means I processed a lot
   of invoices—and eventually started writing. While writing
   professionally, I was laid off two more times and now I’m here at
   Lifehacker (and very knowledgable about the New York State unemployment
   process).

Take us through a recent workday.

   My day starts at night. At around midnight, I’m usually searching for
   story ideas and Slack them to myself. I have an RSS feed set up through
   Feedly, but I usually make it a point to read/skim headlines on the New
   York Times, Washington Post, CNN, and check Twitter and Reddit. (I’m a
   frequent user in r/Politics and r/Fitness.)

   I wake up around 7:45 a.m., feed my cat, and look for more story ideas
   and watch the news⁠ on ⁠NY1. If I have time, I’ll also watch the Today
   Show or Good Morning America (or watch Watch What Happens reruns from
   the night before). I’m lucky that I live close to the office, so I can
   usually leave at 9 on the dot and get in within 20 minutes. By 9:30, I
   usually have a good game plan for my day and start researching and
   writing.

What apps, gadgets, or tools can’t you live without?

   Advertisement

     * Flipboard
     * Reddit
     * Rover
     * Soundprint
     * Underway
     * Netvue
     * Plague, Inc.
     * PS4

What’s your workspace setup like?

   Since we’ve only been at our new office for a few months, I don’t have
   much and most of the things on my desk don’t belong to me, aside from
   the laptop and sign in the back I made for the Climate Strike. (I work
   from all over the office, so my desk setup isn’t a big deal to me.)

   The books you see were sent to our remote editors. The keyboard on the
   right was sitting on my desk when I got here (and possibly belonged to
   BET staff, who occupied this space before us). And the sickly plant
   (named Brian) belongs to our deputy editor Alice. I can assure you he
   is thriving now!

   Honestly, I’m just very grateful to have a work laptop. At one of my
   first writing gigs, I had an enormous desktop computer and my personal
   laptop was on its very last limb. I’m very happy to have the ability to
   physically move and still work. (It’s the little things.)

What’s your favorite shortcut or hack?

   This isn’t groundbreaking, but I have a lot of Google alerts set up for
   story ideas and particular phrases (maybe 25+?). When I worked at Mic,
   we had a column called “Food and Politics,” which was devoted to
   politicians’ eating behaviors (lol). Google alerts really came in handy
   here because it wasn’t like the New York Times reported on what Beto
   O’Rourke ate that week.

Take us through an interesting, unusual, or finicky process you have in place
at work.

   Advertisement

   I get up a lot from my desk and take a walk to the kitchen or grab a
   coffee before I submit most stories. I can develop a one-track mind
   when I’m writing and I think it’s helpful to get some perspective. By
   the time I’m back at my desk, I can more clearly edit/decide when
   things aren’t making sense. If I’m able to, I’ll wait until the next
   morning to edit something just for more clarity.

Who are the people who help you get things done, and how do you rely on them?

   Goes without saying, but my editors. I’m very in my head when I write
   and can be self-critical. I’ll reach out if I’m deep in a hole I can’t
   crawl out of myself; usually it’s because I’m so caught up in details
   that probably don’t make sense/impact the outcome of the story.
   I fed goats on a farm in Hawaii for an assignment last year and was
   very excited about it (but not as excited as the goats).

How do you recharge or take a break?

   I eat or have more coffee. I’ve also very recently gotten into
   album/song reaction videos on YouTube. I can’t adequately describe why
   they’re so great but it’s fun to hear people respond to albums for the
   first time that you love so much. I’ll listen to one while I’m
   struggling with a story or just want a little break.

   Outside of work, I take a half-hour nap every day. It’s life-changing.

What are you currently reading, or what do you recommend?

   I’m in the middle of Michelle Obama’s memoir right now and plan to read
   Pete Buttigieg’s Shortest Way Home next (or Abbi Jacobson from Broad
   City’s I Might Regret This; can’t decide). I very recently re-read
   Anthony Bourdain’s Kitchen Confidential (which I love) and finished
   Stephanie Danler’s Sweetbitter.

Can you share a music playlist you’ve made, whether for working or elsewhere?

   Advertisement

   I don’t have public playlists, but a few songs currently on rotation:
     * Banks “Gimme”
     * Marina and the Diamonds “Karma”
     * Gabrielle Aplin “Kintsugi”
     * Alabama Shakes “This Feeling” (thanks, Fleabag!)

Who else would you like to see answer these questions?

   Nathan Fielder or my cat.

What’s the best advice you’ve ever received?

   “Don’t tell people that you’re willing to work long hours because
   they’ll take advantage of it.”

What’s a problem you’re still trying to solve?

   How little sleep I can survive on without compromising my ability to
   think rationally.
   How I WorkThe How I Work series asks heroes, experts, and all-around
   productive people to share their shortcuts, workspaces, routines, and
   more.

Update to iOS 13.1 Now

   Yesterday 4:00pm

   Photo: Wachiwit (Shutterstock)

   iOS 13's launch was, frankly, a bit of a mess—so much so that we, and
   plenty of others, even recommended iOS users wait a bit before
   upgrading. Thankfully, you don’t have to hold out any longer: Apple
   began rolling out the iOS 13.1 patch, meaning the time to upgrade is
   finally here. And for those who already made the jump to iOS 13,
   today’s version update fixes several bugs and smooths the OS’s
   performance for an overall better experience.

   Here’s everything that iOS 13.1 adds, fixes, or changes:
     * Numerous stability tweaks and bug fixes, including a fix for the
       privacy location bug found in the initial iOS 13 build.
     * Updated dynamic wallpapers, which are also now available on all
       iPhone models (were previously iPhone 11-exclusive)
     * A new “ETA Share” option in Apple Maps, plus an update to Maps’
       “collections” feature that will alert you before deleting entire
       collections
     * An “Automations” tab has been re-added to Shortcuts
     * New Airdrop interface for iPhone 11 models
     * A new “Reading Goals” toggle in Apple Books
     * A new Airpods icon will be displayed in the volume controls
       interface when connected.
     * Battery display icons for wirelessly connected game controllers
     * New icon the denote beta apps
     * Updated system font settings
     * Updates to video and audio codec support

   These add to iOS 13's other previously released features, such as a new

   be available for all users soon, though the exact rollout schedule
   varies. You can check for new updates by going to Settings > General >
   Software Update on your iPhone. If you were in the iOS 13.1 beta,
   you’ll need to roll back to receive the stable version of the update.
