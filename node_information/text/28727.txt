   Educational Screening of Last Black Man in San Francisco (2019)

   Film Description: Jimmie Fails dreams of reclaiming the Victorian home
   his grandfather built in the heart of San Francisco. Joined on his
   quest by his best friend Mont, Jimmie searches for belonging in a
   rapidly changing city that seems to have left them behind. As he
   struggles to reconnect with his family and reconstruct the community he
   longs for, his hopes blind him to the reality of his situation.

   Join us for a talk back following the film.

   2h 1min | R

   Director: Joe Talbot


   Get to the Schomburg Center early to view the exhibition and join the
   conversation.


   EXHIBITION PROGRAMS

   Black Americans have had to “create sites of endurance, belonging, and
   resistance through social interaction” noted scholars Marcus Anthony
   Hunter, Mary Pattillo, Zandria F. Robinson, Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor in
   their 2016 article "Black Placemaking: Celebration, Play, and
   Poetry." A Ballad for Harlem Conversations explores this definition of
   black placemaking, having broad appeal for diverse, inter-generational
   audiences, and provides new perspectives on contemporary issues.

   About the Exhibition

   A Ballad for Harlem examines several strands of Black placemaking in
   the 20th century, offering views of residents and institutions
   committed to community, innovation, education, fervent political
   engagement, cultural affirmation, global perspectives, and creativity.
   Exhibition highlights include the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters,
   the Speakers Corner, items from the recent acquisitions of artist and
   activists Ruby Dee and Ossie Davis and author Ann Petry, artwork by
   contemporary Nigeria-based artist Modupeola Fadugba featuring Harlem
   Honeys and Bears, Harlem's daughter and tennis champion Althea Gibson,
   sculptures by Augusta Savage, and street scene photography of 1930s
   Harlem. Over the century that the Schomburg Center has borne witness to
   Harlem's evolution, A Ballad for Harlem offers contemplation now in the
   midst of gentrification as new comers and long-time residents navigate
   the liminal space--a transition between what was and what is to come.

   Please contact us immediately for American Sign Language (ASL)
   interpretation. Requests can be made by calling 212-340-0951 or
   212-340-0909, or e-mail accessibility@nypl.org.

What are your hopes and concerns for your community? What are the most
important issues in your community right now?

   Local Voices Network conversation

   The New York Public Library is launching an exciting new initiative
   this fall, in collaboration with the Local Voices Network (LVN).

   Library staff and community partners will record neighborhood
   conversations on the issues important to New Yorkers. These recordings
   will then be shared on a searchable website for journalists,
   decision-makers, and other local stakeholders to tune into the
   community’s real concerns. Together, we’ll create a platform where
   anyone and everyone is invited to speak and be heard.

   Join us at Countee Cullen Library to learn more about LVN and celebrate
   Arts Advocacy Week in Harlem with a Poetry Jam session!

   Here’s what you can expect at the Harlem LVN Kick-Off:
     * Listen to opening poems from local writers.
     * Test out the Digital Hearth, a recording device for group
       conversations.
     * Share your ideas for how we should build this project in Harlem.
     * Ask staff from The City about how local news can best reflect your
       community.
     * Sign up to participate in a recorded conversation, become a
       volunteer host, or partner with us.

   Sign up HERE  e-mail nyc@lvn.org. RSVPs are necessary for this event. A
   light dinner will be served.

   About the Local Voices Network:

   The Local Voices Network project aims to bring the perspectives and
   concerns of everyday New Yorkers to light through facilitated community
   conversations that invite anyone and everyone to the table to share and
   listen. Conversations are recorded and transcribed with the goal of
   offering media, local leadership, and the greater public a new window
   into the most important community issues. Learn more at our
   website lvn.org.
