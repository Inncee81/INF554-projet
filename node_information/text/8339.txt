Fact or Fiction: The Days (and Nights) Are Getting Longer

   Fossilized corals, lasers beamed at a receding moon, Chinese artifacts,
   and other evidence have revealed that over the ages the length of time
   it takes Earth to spin once on its axis has increased significantly

   The summer solstice that falls this year on June 21 marks the longest
   day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere, sunlight-wise. Almost
   imperceptibly, however, Earth's day–night cycle—one rotation on its
   axis—is growing longer year by year, and has been for most of the
   planet's history.

   Forces from afar conspire to put the brakes on our spinning world—ocean
   tides generated by both the moon and sun's gravity add 1.7 milliseconds
   to the length of a day each century, although that figure changes on
   geologic timescales. The moon is slowly spiraling away from Earth as it
   drives day-stretching tides, a phenomenon recorded in rocks and fossils
   that provides clues to the satellite's origin and ultimate fate.
   "You're putting energy into the moon's orbit and taking it out of the
   Earth's spin," says James Williams, a senior research scientist at
   NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.

   The moon's gravity generates tides by pulling hardest on the side of
   Earth facing it. This attraction causes the planet to bulge, especially
   in its malleable oceans. (The sun affects tides in the same way,
   although in comparison due to its great distance they amount to only
   about a fifth of the lunar influence on our planetary pirouette.) Earth
   rotates faster than the moon orbits it, so the watery tidal bulge
   travels ahead of the moon's relative position. This displaced mass
   gravitationally tugs the moon forward, imparting energy and giving the
   satellite an orbital boost, whereas friction along the seafloor curbs
   Earth's rotation.

   Williams has studied how fast the moon is corkscrewing away by shining
   lasers from Earth at prism-shaped reflectors placed on the lunar
   surface in the late 1960s and early 1970s by U.S. astronauts and
   unmanned Russian probes. Changes in the beam's round-trip time reveal
   the moon's recession rate—3.8 centimeters per year—which, largely due
   to the orientation of Earth's landmasses and its effect on oceanic
   sloshing, is faster now than in previous epochs, Williams says.

   Hints of inconsistent Earthly timekeeping come through natural
   calendars preserved in fossils. Corals, for example, go through daily
   and seasonal growing cycles that form bands akin to growth rings in
   trees; counting them shows how many days passed in a year. In the early
   Carboniferous period some 350 million years ago an Earth year was
   around 385 days, ancient corals indicate, meaning not that it took
   longer for the planet to revolve around the sun, but that a day–night
   cycle was less than 23 hours long.

   Sedimentary rocks such as sandstone also testify to the quicker days of
   yore. As moon-spawned tides wash over rocks they deposit mineral
   specks, layer upon layer. In southern Australia, for example, these
   vertically accumulating tidal "rhythmites" have pegged an Earth day at
   21.9 hours some 620 million years ago. This equates to a 400-day year,
   although other estimates suggest even brisker daily rotations then.

   "As you start going further back in time, the records get difficult to
   interpret," says Kurt Lambeck, a geophysicist at the Australian
   National University in Canberra. Lambeck, who serves as president of
   the Australian Academy of Science, wrote a book on the subject, The
   Earth's Variable Rotation: Geophysical Causes and Consequences, in
   1980. "But the records have tended to support a general pattern going
   back that the number of days in the year increases," Lambeck says.

   These data demonstrate that today's regular ocean tides also happened
   deep in the past, says Lambeck, lending support to the prevailing moon
   formation theory of a collision between a primordial Earth and a
   Mars-size body 4.5 billion years ago. If the moon were instead formed
   elsewhere and later captured by Earth's gravity, the tides would not
   have held so steady throughout history, Lambeck says.

   Most computer simulations of this explosive lunar genesis suggest that
   Earth whirled afterward on its axis every six hours, says Jay Melosh,
   an Earth and atmospheric scientist at Purdue University. As the moon
   has migrated out from an initial tighter orbit of perhaps 25,000
   kilometersto the modern average distance of 384,000 kilometers, it has
   teamed up with the sun to protract Earthly days fourfold.

   Early human record-keeping of solar eclipses has also bolstered the
   case for lengthening the planet's rotation time. Researchers have
   extrapolated orbital paths back 32 centuries, demonstrating that if
   Earth's rotation rate had not changed, eclipse shadows would have
   appeared thousands of kilometers from Chinese scribes who etched
   astronomical observations into animal bones. The math indicates that
   days now are 0.047 second longer than they were in 1200 B.C.

   Arriving at this comparatively recent value required factoring in the
   changing shape of Earth itself due to the thawing of the last ice age,
   NASA's Williams says. As ice in northern latitudes began melting about
   13,000 years ago, the ground rose underneath, making Earth rotate
   faster, rather like a spinning figure skater who pulls her arms above
   her head. This continuing post-glacial rebound shaves about 0.6 second
   off a day per century—not enough to trump tidal braking caused by the
   moon and sun.

   Accordingly, over the eons separating ice ages, the length of Earth's
   day can waver. Even on a daily basis, as it were, day length is tweaked
   millionths of a second by shifting mass in the oceans due to windy
   weather and geologic shifts, such as the magnitude 8.8 Chilean
   earthquake that struck in February. And global warming is expected to
   shorten the day by 0.12 millisecond over the next two centuries by
   heating the oceans and changing the distribution of its mass.

   As days dilate overall, "leap seconds" have to be added to official
   Universal Time, which is based an Earth's rotation, to keep it in sync
   with ultraprecise atomic clocks that are far more stable. Twenty-four
   leap seconds have accrued since 1972; the most recent was tacked on in
   December 2008.

   Those leap seconds will not cease. "The moon will continue to go
   farther away and Earth will continue to slow down," Lambeck says, until
   Earth becomes tidally locked, meaning only one hemisphere of our planet
   will see the moon in the sky. (The moon is already tidally locked in
   its revolution around Earth, so we see the same lunar hemisphere at all
   times.) A single day on Earth could eventually exceed 1,000 hours, but
   a back-of-the-envelope reckoning has this happening in 50 billion
   years. By then, the oceans—the main source of tidal friction—will have
   long since evaporated, and Earth and the moon might be toast, gobbled
   up tens of billions of years earlier by the ballooning red giant sun.

   Should the Earth–moon system survive this cataclysm, upon mutual tidal
   locking the moon would actually begin spiraling back in toward Earth,
   and the day-lengthening process would reverse itself. Eventually,
   Lambeck says, the moon would be gravitationally shattered or might even
   smash into Earth, which would make for a long day, figuratively
   speaking, for anyone still around.

   formation theory of a collision between a primordial Earth and a
   Mars-size body 4.5 billion years ago. If the moon were instead formed
   elsewhere and later captured by Earth's gravity, the tides would not
   have held so steady throughout history, Lambeck says.

   Most computer simulations of this explosive lunar genesis suggest that
   Earth whirled afterward on its axis every six hours, says Jay Melosh,
   an Earth and atmospheric scientist at Purdue University. As the moon
   has migrated out from an initial tighter orbit of perhaps 25,000
   kilometersto the modern average distance of 384,000 kilometers, it has
   teamed up with the sun to protract Earthly days fourfold.

   Early human record-keeping of solar eclipses has also bolstered the
   case for lengthening the planet's rotation time. Researchers have
   extrapolated orbital paths back 32 centuries, demonstrating that if
   Earth's rotation rate had not changed, eclipse shadows would have
   appeared thousands of kilometers from Chinese scribes who etched
   astronomical observations into animal bones. The math indicates that
   days now are 0.047 second longer than they were in 1200 B.C.

   Arriving at this comparatively recent value required factoring in the
   changing shape of Earth itself due to the thawing of the last ice age,
   NASA's Williams says. As ice in northern latitudes began melting about
   13,000 years ago, the ground rose underneath, making Earth rotate
   faster, rather like a spinning figure skater who pulls her arms above
   her head. This continuing post-glacial rebound shaves about 0.6 second
   off a day per century—not enough to trump tidal braking caused by the
   moon and sun.

   Accordingly, over the eons separating ice ages, the length of Earth's
   day can waver. Even on a daily basis, as it were, day length is tweaked
   millionths of a second by shifting mass in the oceans due to windy
   weather and geologic shifts, such as the magnitude 8.8 Chilean
   earthquake that struck in February. And global warming is expected to
   shorten the day by 0.12 millisecond over the next two centuries by
   heating the oceans and changing the distribution of its mass.

   As days dilate overall, "leap seconds" have to be added to official
   Universal Time, which is based an Earth's rotation, to keep it in sync
   with ultraprecise atomic clocks that are far more stable. Twenty-four
   leap seconds have accrued since 1972; the most recent was tacked on in
   December 2008.

   Those leap seconds will not cease. "The moon will continue to go
   farther away and Earth will continue to slow down," Lambeck says, until
   Earth becomes tidally locked, meaning only one hemisphere of our planet
   will see the moon in the sky. (The moon is already tidally locked in
   its revolution around Earth, so we see the same lunar hemisphere at all
   times.) A single day on Earth could eventually exceed 1,000 hours, but
   a back-of-the-envelope reckoning has this happening in 50 billion
   years. By then, the oceans—the main source of tidal friction—will have
   long since evaporated, and Earth and the moon might be toast, gobbled
   up tens of billions of years earlier by the ballooning red giant sun.

   Should the Earth–moon system survive this cataclysm, upon mutual tidal
   locking the moon would actually begin spiraling back in toward Earth,
   and the day-lengthening process would reverse itself. Eventually,
   Lambeck says, the moon would be gravitationally shattered or might even
   smash into Earth, which would make for a long day, figuratively
   speaking, for anyone still around.
