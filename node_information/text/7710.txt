Xxxtentacion’s estate teases new song, ‘Royalty,’ one year after his death

   Xxxtentacion visits a Fort Lauderdale, Fla., radio station in 2017.

   The estate of the late rapper Xxxtentacion is expected to release a new
   track by the artist on Friday, called “Royalty,” feeding a demand that
   shows no signs of slowing down a year after his death. A snippet of the
   song has been floating around the internet since April, and an
   Instagram account reportedly linked to the estate teased the release on
   Tuesday. The track will be included on a deluxe reissue of
   Xxxtentacion’s album "?,” which will come out July 26.

   Issued by Capitol Records, the forthcoming release will be the first
   major project since Xxx was murdered on June 18, 2018, during an
   ambush-robbery in South Florida. He was 20. A two-CD edition will
   feature the original album and its instrumentals, along with Xxx’s
   Christmas EP; a “bonus” disc includes “Royalty,” other new material,
   some remixes and voices memos. A booklet will include never-before-seen
   photos. There will also be an $80 triple LP version.

   The release will likely face comparisons with another posthumous
   record, by fellow Soundcloud rap star Lil Peep (who was born Gustav
   Åhr). A few days ago on the artist’s official Instagram account, Peep’s
   mother asked, “Who wants a new album with amazing unreleased Lil Peep
   music put together by Gus’ mom and the songs’ original collaborators?
   You have been asking for this, and I can’t wait to get it to you!” That
   will be Peep’s second post-death release.

   Xxxtentacion’s estate has so far only issued a few extant tracks, but
   his presence is all over the charts. Hitmaker JuiceWRLD just dropped a
   new track called “Run” that samples an unreleased Xxx track; the
   original version of "?” just jumped back into the top 50 of Billboard’s
   Top 200 album chart after hitting No. 1; it’s been on the chart for 69
   weeks. Xxxtentacion’s album “17" just cracked the top 100 on that same
   chart, part of a 98-week run that peaked at No. 2.

Netflix acquires the global streaming rights to ‘Seinfeld’

   Netflix has fired back in the battle for popular network sitcoms by
   landing the global streaming rights to “Seinfeld.”

   As part of a deal with Sony Pictures Television, which controls
   distribution of the iconic TV show, Netflix will offer all 180 episodes
   of “Seinfeld” in the U.S. and to its 151 million subscribers throughout
   the world when the five-year pact takes effect in 2021, the companies
   announced Monday.

   “‘Seinfeld’ is a one-of-a-kind, iconic, culture-defining show,” Sony
   Pictures Television Chairman Mike Hopkins said in a statement to The
   Times. “Now, 30 years after its premiere, ‘Seinfeld’ remains center
   stage. We’re thrilled to be partnering with Netflix to bring this
   beloved series to current fans and new audiences around the globe.”

   Landing “Seinfeld” is a major comeback statement for Netflix, which
   recently lost the streaming rights to “The Office” and “Friends” to the
   media conglomerates that own those shows. “The Office” will be part of
   NBCUniversal’s new streaming service, while “Friends” will be offered
   on WarnerMedia’s upcoming HBO Max platform.

   Terms of the transaction were not disclosed, but Netflix paid far more
   than the $500 million NBCUniversal paid for “The Office,” and the $425
   million WarnerMedia shelled out for “Friends,” people familiar with the
   deal said. Both of those five-year deals were for streaming rights in
   the U.S. only.

   Hulu, which is majority owned by Walt Disney Co., has the current
   domestic streaming rights to “Seinfeld,” paying about $130 million in a
   six-year deal that expires in 2021. Amazon had the streaming rights in
   most of the foreign territories that will be picked up by Netfilx.

   For the next five-year licensing period, Netflix topped bids from Hulu,
   Amazon, WarnerMedia, NBCUniversal and Viacom, which controls the CBS
   All Access streaming service since its merger with CBS Corp., according
   to people familiar with the discussions who were not authorized to
   comment.

   “Seinfeld is the television comedy that all television comedy is
   measured against,” Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s chief content officer, said
   in a statement. “It is as fresh and funny as ever and will be available
   to the world in 4K for the first time.”

   The move was a blow to NBCUniversal, which had a long association with
   “Seinfeld” and could have used the show to help lure viewers to its
   upcoming streaming service.

   But Netflix is said to have been particularly aggressive in pursuing
   “Seinfeld,” which is one of a handful of durable, long-running comedy
   series that appeal to several generations of viewers. “Seinfeld,” which
   stars comedian Jerry Seinfeld as himself going through single life in
   Manhattan with his solipsistic pals, ran from 1989 to 1998 on NBC and
   ended its original run while still ranking as the No. 1 show in prime
   time, according to Nielsen.

   The other broad-appeal sitcoms available on the streaming market —
   Warner Bros. Televison’s “The Big Bang Theory” and “Two and a Half Men”
   — are both expected to go to parent company WarnerMedia’s HBO Max. Some
   TV producers believe it has become futile for Netflix to bid against
   companies that are pursuing the rights for their own shows and
   essentially paying themselves.

   The ownership of “Seinfeld,” produced by the defunct studio Castle
   Rock, is spread among several entities, including WarnerMedia, CBS,
   Seinfeld and his co-creator, Larry David. All will share in the revenue
   from the Netflix deal after Sony receives a significant percentage as
   the show’s distributor.

   Even 20 years after “Seinfeld” left NBC, the show’s repeats remain a
   popular attraction on local TV stations and cable network TBS, and have
   generated billions of dollars in revenue worldwide.

   Netflix is already the streaming home for Seinfeld’s current series,
   “Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,” and his stand-up comedy specials.
   The relationship was not a determining factor in “Seinfeld” going to
   the service, sources said.

   In its recent earnings call for investors, Netflix executives
   downplayed the significance of losing “Friends” and “The Office.” The
   Los Gatos-based company has said it would have to eventually wean
   itself from outside program suppliers — a major reason why it invested
   $12 billion on content in 2018 and is investing $15 billion this year.

   The “Seinfeld” deal should not be seen as a departure from that
   strategy, according to an executive familiar with the matter. But the
   company will continue to license shows from outside suppliers when it’s
   seen as making sense for its business.

Constance Wu fought for ‘Hustlers.’ But the spotlight is the real challenge

   (Marcus Yam / Los Angeles Times)
   By Jen Yamato Staff Writer

   It’s a chilly night on the rooftop of a New York City strip club when
   four words entice Constance Wu’s newbie dancer Destiny into the
   maternal, couture-lined fold of Jennifer Lopez’s glamorous Ramona in
   “Hustlers”: “Climb in my fur.”

   Alas, Destiny’s hunger for cash and connection has a cost in the
   true-crime female-empowerment movie of the season, opening Sept. 13
   following a world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival
   the weekend prior, in which a stilettoed sisterhood of ex-strippers
   scheme to steal from their Wall Street clients after the 2008 financial
   crisis. (The real-life tabloid-ready tale ended in arrests, as
   documented in the 2015 New York Magazine article on which “Hustlers” is
   based.)
   For the record:
   9:53 AM, Aug. 30, 2019 In an earlier version of this article, actress
   Lili Reinhart’s last name was misspelled as Reinhardt.

   To fans who know Wu best from television, playing an exotic
   dancer-turned-criminal might seem like quite a detour from Jessica
   Huang, the suburban sitcom mom she’s played for five seasons and
   counting on ABC’s “Fresh Off the Boat.” It’s only her second lead film
   role after portraying plucky rom-com heroine Rachel Chu in last
   summer’s “Crazy Rich Asians,” the Golden Globe-nominated hit that sent
   Wu’s Hollywood star skyrocketing.

   But Wu, 37, wanted the role so strongly she put herself on tape for
   writer-director Lorene Scafaria, to the mild bewilderment of her own
   agents.

   “I was looking for a movie with a character that was deeply lonely,”
   she said on a recent afternoon in the Times office, relaxing in a
   sundress and denim jacket, a cap pulled over her hair. She had noticed,
   and perhaps even felt herself, an overriding sense of isolation
   swirling in the zeitgeist.

   “I feel like loneliness right now is pervasive because of social
   media,” she said. “Some people aren’t connecting as much, or they don’t
   know how to do it in real life.”

   There was something else she was looking for too. After zooming into
   the spotlight as a rising Hollywood star and the anchor of two
   groundbreaking Asian American hit projects, she was on the hunt for
   roles that were multidimensional, human, complex.

   “In every project I choose, I want a character that gets to run the
   gamut of a full spectrum of an arc,” said Wu, whose “Hustlers”
   character, like the women around her, contains multitudes: The daughter
   of immigrants and a single mother herself, she’s a ladyboss in the
   making — until she’s left holding the designer bag. “Destiny has
   moments where she’s really funny, and moments when she’s really sad.
   Moments where she’s irresponsible, moments where she’s the only one who
   is responsible. That complexity is what I seek in any role, and this
   script really afforded her that journey.”

   Scafaria (“Seeking a Friend for the End of the World,” “The Meddler”)
   wrote the screenplay, imagining Lopez as the perfect Ramona, the
   ringleader set on turning the tables on the sleazy suits who
   underestimate women like her. Signing Lopez was the first piece of the
   casting puzzle for “Hustlers,” which STX acquired for production after
   a struggling Annapurna put the film in turnaround. (Annapurna head
   Megan Ellison remains an executive producer on the film.)

   The search for Destiny led to Wu, and then to the stacked ensemble,
   which includes Keke Palmer, Lili Reinhart, Julia Stiles, Mercedes
   Ruehl, Madeline Brewer, Trace Lysette, Lizzo (and her flute) and Cardi
   B.

   “Constance connected with this and wanted a shot at doing something
   that is obviously so different from anything we’ve ever seen her do,”
   said producer Jessica Elbaum, who optioned Jessica Pressler’s original
   article for Gloria Sanchez Productions.

   As soon as they met, Scafaria and Wu clicked. “I saw that she has a
   fragility and a vulnerability and a sensitivity and a very deep core,”
   said the writer-director. “She’s obviously a very gifted comedic
   actress, and she brought me to tears in ‘Crazy Rich Asians,’ so she is
   an incredible dramatic actress too. But I think she has weight and
   chops. And when I met her, I felt that.

   “I couldn’t be more proud of her,” Scafaria said of the actress. “She
   put herself out there; she tweezed those eyebrows up to 2007!”

   Filming began in New York this spring before STX, which has recently
   endured a series of flops including “UglyDolls” and “Poms,”
   fast-tracked “Hustlers” for a fall release. (Early tracking suggests
   the film could debut to the studio’s highest opening weekend gross
   ever.)
   “Hustlers” follows a crew of savvy former strip club employees who band
   together to turn the tables on their Wall Street clients. It stars
   Constance Wu, Jennifer Lopez, Lizzo, Cardi B. and more.

   To prepare for the role, Wu studied hours of interview tapes of
   Destiny’s real-life inspiration, former dancer Roselyn Keo, playing
   them on a loop in her trailer for reference. “When a culture at large
   judges you, in a way, there is camaraderie amongst each other because
   we know who we are even though they don’t,” Wu said of meeting
   real-life strippers for research.

   “Hustlers” aims to do justice to the unseen dimensions of these women’s
   lives. “That’s why we make movies like this. These women are trying
   their best in a world that has not always been fair to them. That’s the
   hustle: trying to get that dream when you started out 10 steps behind
   everybody else.”

   She impressed costar and producer Lopez during a scene in which their
   characters, who become both business partners and close friends, begin
   to disagree on the limits of their increasingly volatile scam
   operation.

   “There is a scene in the movie that we filmed early on where Destiny
   and Ramona get into a fight, and Constance really went for it,” said
   Lopez in an email. “And I was like, ‘Wow! OK. She is a gangster. We are
   going to do this movie.’ I think their story lines are fascinating
   because they start very similarly — same desires, same goals. But as
   they come more into their power and into more ‘success,’ their stories
   and thus their friendship really starts to diverge.”

   Wu could have taken easier roads after her “Crazy Rich Asians” success.
   The Richmond, Va., native had chased the classic actor hustle for
   years, working in theater, on TV and in indie films before scoring
   breakout status on “Fresh Off the Boat” opposite Randall Park and
   Hudson Yang.

   Premiering in 2015, it was the first Asian American-led sitcom to hit
   prime-time in 20 years. By 2017, Wu had been named one of Time’s Most
   Influential People, buoyed by her vocal activism online and in the
   Time’s Up movement. The same year, she was cast in “Crazy Rich Asians,”
   which also made history as the first Asian American-centered studio
   film in a quarter century. In the wake of “Crazy Rich Asians,” Wu is
   now able to get projects green-lighted, such as the upcoming novel
   adaptation “Goodbye, Vitamin,” in which she’ll star and executive
   produce.

   But with great power and over 1 million followers on social media comes
   great accountability, a lesson Wu admits she was still learning earlier
   this year when she posted negative reactions on Twitter and Instagram
   to the news that “Fresh Off the Boat” had been renewed for a sixth
   season.

   The blowback was immediate. Wu quickly apologized and provided context,
   saying she was upset that she’d have to forgo another project. “My
   words and ill-timing were insensitive to those who are struggling,
   especially insensitive considering the fact that I used to be in that
   struggle too. I do regret that and it wasn’t nice and I am sorry for
   that,” she wrote in a lengthy Instagram post.

   Though she didn’t go into detail at the time, it wasn’t another film
   but a play she’d been hoping to do — one in which she would have played
   a “not Asian-specific” role and likely worked for scale — that Wu had
   to give up to return to her show, for which she is under contract for
   another two years.

   “I had this moment of heat where I got upset because I had to give up a
   job I had been looking forward to and had been chasing for a while,”
   she said of her self-described “Twitter fiasco.” “It was moving to me
   how many people from the show reached out to me, and even on set ... to
   say, ‘Just so you know, we love you and we know who you are, and you
   didn’t deserve any of that stuff.’ Because they also know that I’m an
   actress — I can be dramatic.”

   Actors admitting they’re dramatic? A rarity! She laughed. “I mean,
   that’s our toolkit, right? I’m dramatic. I’m emotional. But they also
   know that that doesn’t represent me because they have a hundred
   episodes of behavior that proves otherwise.”
   “I don’t want to be in one box. There’s a part of me that’s like
   Jessica Huang, that’s why I can play her. There’s a part of me that’s
   like Destiny, that’s why I can play her.”

   She also learned a lesson from the backlash: Her platform affords her a
   greater reach than she realized. “I’m not beating myself up for it,
   because I know me,” said Wu. “But I don’t think I realized that people
   were paying so much attention to my Twitter.”

   At the time, she wasn’t sure the show would get renewed for a sixth
   season. Now, a part of her worries she’ll be blamed if Season 6 is its
   last. Still, Wu says, she regrets that her tweets affected others,
   including castmates, colleagues and ABC president Karey Burke.

   “I like that people are expressing their feelings about it, because it
   improved my awareness of what it means to be a ... public figure,” She
   paused, turning over the phrase. “I’ve had a back-and-forth about it.
   It’s the line between being a role model but also authenticity.”

   “I think a lot of why people are lonely in this world is because they
   go through these Instagram feeds and everybody’s life is perfect,” she
   said. “Nobody trips up. And sometimes I think, might it be good to see
   our heroes mess up a little bit and not always be perfect?”

   Imperfection is a quality seldom afforded those who carry the added
   mantle of representation. If Wu’s Asian American fans were particularly
   disappointed by her tweets, it may be because they were rooting for her
   to succeed, an emblem to champion in a Hollywood that’s still so slow
   to change. Can the public allow Wu to be fallible and human, still
   speak her mind, and learn as she goes?

   “There is an expectation of the way that I ought to behave, and not
   just of perfection but of graciousness. And I am grateful. But am I
   elegant?” she said with a laugh. “No. I think I can be verbally
   eloquent sometimes, but as a human, am I an elegant person? No.”

     Me getting to play a fully human experience as an Asian American,
     that shouldn’t be historic. But it is.

   Constance Wu

   As a wise oracle once sang, “A diva is a female version of a hustler.”
   Yet Wu, who just filled out her summer by paying her own way to Hawaii
   to act in an indie film for an emerging Asian American director, found
   herself at the center of headlines during the “Hustlers” promo tour
   describing her as a “diva.”

   Wu considered the label. “A woman owning her power rather than being
   like, ‘Who, me?,’ I think, is a threat to the patriarchy,” said Wu. “I
   know some people were like, ‘Constance demanded top billing.’ No, the
   script had me as the lead. But it’s a juicier story to say the other
   stuff.

   “I am grateful for my entire career,” she said. “But the fact that my
   career has been historic shouldn’t necessarily be a call [to say to]
   me, ‘You should be so lucky’ — it should be a call to pay attention to
   the fact that this kind of thing shouldn’t have been historic. Me
   getting to play a fully human experience as an Asian American, that
   shouldn’t be historic. But it is. Let’s talk about the system, not
   whether or not I deserve to be in it and how I need to feel about it.”

   Wu reiterated that her platform, even if it comes with public scrutiny,
   is not something she takes for granted.

   “I do think when you have a platform, you ought to make sure you use it
   as well and responsibly as you can,” said Wu, who returns to TV with
   the season premiere of “Fresh Off the Boat” on Sept. 27.

   “But,” she continued, flashing a wry smile, “I want to be careful not
   to blow up my profile any more. If it happens as a natural extension of
   me doing the thing that I think I am meant to do, which is to be an
   actor, then I welcome it and I’m grateful for it. That’s not the part
   of myself I’m seeking to put energy into ... but it teaches me.”
