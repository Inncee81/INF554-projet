   Transdev Sweden announces that it has won the bus market in Gothenburg,
   Sweden’s second largest city, for a total value of €757 million from
   Västtrafik, the transit authority in the Västra Götaland region. These
   contracts reinforce Transdev’s commercial offensive in Sweden,
   following the announcement last December of a major ferry contract in
   the Stockholm archipelago.

   With these five new contracts, Transdev will become the main bus
   operator in Gothenburg and its region, covering Gothenburg, Frölunda,
   Mölndal, Partille and all express bus lines, and will carry more than
   71 million passengers annually. These new 10-year contracts will start
   in December 2020.

   Under these contracts, Transdev will operate 370 buses and will
   commission 160 new zero-emission electric buses. The other 210 buses
   will operate without fossil fuels and will run exclusively on biofuels.
   Transdev already operates nearly 60 electric buses in Sweden, in
   particular in Umeå, Eskilstuna, Stockholm and Gothenburg. In December
   2020, Transdev will be operating 220 electric buses, the largest fleet
   of electric buses in Sweden.

   For Transdev, the energy transition is a commitment to quickly convert
   our vehicle fleet to a growing proportion of low-emission and
   zero-emission vehicles. Reducing economic and energy dependence on
   fossil fuels is also a priority for Transdev and for Europe in order to
   ensure a real transformation of our economic model towards ever cleaner
   sustainable mobility.
   Thierry Mallet, Chairman and CEO of Transdev Group

   We are very proud of Västtrafik’s renewed trust. We already operate
   many urban, interurban and regional contracts with public transit
   authorities and are thus consolidating our Swedish operations. The
   Transdev Group is also a leading regional rail operator in Sweden, as
   well as one of the leaders in ferry operations”, said Christian
   Schreyer, CEO of Northern and Central Europe of Transdev Group.

   The transition to zero-emission solutions for Transdev, and for the
   public transportation sector, is a major concern; the transportation
   industry accounts for around 22% of global energy-related CO2
   emissions.

    The objective of developing and deploying zero-emission solutions is
   Transdev’s social commitment to:
     * improving air quality in our cities;
     * reducing noise pollution;
     * improving life on board for passengers and driving comfort for
       drivers.

   At the end of 2018, Transdev already operated more than 600 electric
   buses and minibuses at 30 sites in 7 countries and should reach 700 by
   the end of 2019. In addition, thanks to the operational commitments
   made in the context of ongoing contracts and calls for tenders,
   Transdev plans to operate more than 1,500 electric buses by 2024.

   In addition to battery-powered buses, Transdev has chosen to actively
   explore hydrogen and fuel cell electric buses, a very promising
   technology for the future, with projects in the Netherlands and France.
   This summer, Transdev will operate France’s first hydrogen electric bus
   line in commercial service, on the Tadao network in the Lens
   conurbation.

   Transdev Sweden employs 4,500 people and had a 2018 turnover of €400
   million.

   Transdev is an international public transport operator, born of the
   merger between Transdev and Veolia Transport. We design transport
   systems for all forms of public, shared, private, city and rural
   transport, dovetailed with mobility-friendly services such as
   applications that combine several transport options, the management of
   contactless payment systems on bus networks and the coordination of
   fleets of taxis and chauffeur-driven cars. Passenger transportation is
   the very essence of our company, which covers every sector: road
   transport with long-haul coaches, BRT, bus networks, rail and marine
   transportation and airports. As a group, Transdev believes that
   innovation is the key to supporting the changes in how people will use
   mobility in the future. Innovation is found in all of our business
   lines, including our research into energy and technological solutions
   such as the design of autonomous and digital vehicles.

   Leader in testing, developing and operating shared autonomous mobility

   in the heart of Montreal, with two EasyMile autonomous shuttles, that
   will extend from 21 June to 4 August of 2019.

   Since May 2018, pilot projects for automated vehicles on public roads
   in Quebec have been permitted subject to the approval of the Ministry
   of Transport. Therefore, in partnership with the City of Montreal,
   Transdev Canada has since developed several large-scale projects. In
   the Fall 2018, an autonomous mobility service was tested within
   Montreal's Olympic Park and Stadium.

   Since last June 21, a new milestone has been reached in Canada with the
   deployment of an experimental service with autonomous shuttles in a
   dense urban environment, in normal traffic, connecting the Olympic Park
   metro station and the highly frequented Maisonneuve Market.

   In this project, Transdev operates two EasyMile autonomous shuttles
   that circulate in the normal daily traffic conditions, crossing
   intersections equipped with intelligent traffic signals with which the
   shuttles communicate, thus providing a new transport service, useful to
   the inhabitants of Montreal, between the Olympic Park and the
   Maisonneuve Market.


   The circuit covers a distance of 1.4 km, carried out in about 6 minutes
   with an average speed of 15 km/h. On board, Transdev operators welcome
   and inform passengers.

   Dans le cadre de cette expérimentation, Transdev opère deux navettes
   autonomes EasyMile capables de circuler dans les conditions normales de
   circulation quotidienne, traversant des carrefours équipés de feux
   intelligents avec lesquels les navettes communiquent, et offrant
   désormais un nouveau service de transport utile aux habitants de
   Montréal, entre le Parc Olympique et le Marché Maisonneuve.

   Le circuit représente un trajet de 1,4 km aller, réalisé en 6 minutes
   environ avec une vitesse moyenne des navettes de 15km/h. A bord, les
   opérateurs de Transdev accueillent et renseignent les passagers.

   At the official launch on June 27, in presence of Eric Alan Caldwell,
   mobility manager on the Executive Committee of the City of Montreal,
   Arthur Nicolet, Chief Executive Officer of Transdev Canada emphasized:
   “Each step of this deployment allows us to address technological
   challenges, as well as to test consumer acceptance of these new modes
   of transport. We are proud to contribute to the development of
   autonomous mobility in Canada, and especially here in Montreal, and are
   committed to safely evolve. People in Montreal are very open to
   discovering new mobility options that will shape the future and we are
   very pleased to offer this carefuly designed pilot option to them“.

   The autonomous shuttle service is free and open to all public, from
   Monday to Sunday from 10am to 6pm, from 21 June to 4 August 2019.

   Transport Infrastructure Ireland and the National Transport Authority
   have awarded Transdev the contract, for six years – plus five option
   years – to operate and maintain Luas, Dublin’s light rail network. The
   Operation and Maintenance (O&M) contract was awarded following an
   international tender process and will come into force on December 1,
   2019.

   Transdev Dublin Light Rail Limited has been operating the Luas light
   rail network since 2004, successfully renewing contracts over the years
   and overseeing 42 million passenger journeys in 2018 across an
   expanding network, composed of two lines: the Red and Green lines
   serving Ireland’s capital city. The east-west Red Line is 20 kilometers
   m long with 32 stops and runs from The Point to Tallaght and from
   Connolly to Saggart. The north-south Green Line is 22 km long with 35
   stops and runs from Broombridge to Brides Glen. Daily, the Luas network
   ensures an average of 110,000 passenger journeys.

   This outcome is a powerful endorsement of Transdev’s global leadership
   in operating 23 light rail systems in eight countries, and comes in
   addition to the new €330 million Stage 1 Parramatta (Sydney, Australia)
   light rail contract won by Transdev in January 2019.

   The choice of Transdev to both operate and maintain Luas reflects the
   Group’s partnership and active collaboration with Transport
   Infrastructure Ireland and the National Transport Authority. Transdev
   has been proudly operating Luas since 2004 and our teams are fully
   committed to Luas customers, the communities we serve and the
   sustainable development of County Dublin. The new Transdev fully
   integrated network management approach will deliver ever greater long
   term success through a rigorous focus on both tram performance and
   customer service.

   “It’s a great honour for Transdev to now have a much-expanded role in
   both operating and maintaining Dublin’s light rail network. As the Luas
   operator for its first 15 years in service, and now until the end of
   2025, we are proud to now ensure maintenance of Dublin’s tram lines.
   With the Sydney light-rail and ferry contracts in Australia, the Bremen
   regional train deal and this new Luas contract, Transdev is further
   demonstrating the ongoing success of its international commercial
   teams”, explains Thierry Mallet, Chairman and CEO of Transdev Group.

   We are particularly proud of the renewed confidence demonstrated by the
   Irish transport authorities in entrusting Transdev with the expanded
   contract to both operate and maintain the Luas light rail network. As
   the incumbent operator since the commencement, we will continue to
   deliver on the highest standards serving the millions of customers
   travelling with Luas every year.
   Christian Schreyer, CEO Northern & Central Europe of Transdev Group

   In now carrying out both operations and maintenance, Transdev will
   preside over managing 42 km of tracks, three depots and 73 light rail
   vehicles with a staff of 350. Alstom (maintenance) employees, currently
   ensuring maintenance works for the Luas network, will transfer to
   Transdev under The Transfer of Undertakings Protection of Employment
   (TUPE) regulations. Transdev will be working closely with Alstom to
   ensure a smooth transition to full Transdev maintenance operations at
   the start of service in December 2019.

   Following the implementation of the Group’s strategic plan, Moving You,
   which focuses on five pillars – customers, talent, clients, performance
   and innovation – and after the reorganization of the Group’s management
   last January, Transdev is setting up a new organization for its
   activities in France. Transdev’s activities in France represent its
   leading global market with 40% of the Group’s business, representing
   €2.7 billion in revenues and a workforce of 34,000 people.

   In a demanding context, which places mobility at the heart of regional
   concerns, faced with the challenges of energy transition and social
   inclusion, and with a view to the upcoming opening of competition in
   the rail sector and in the Greater Paris region, Transdev France is
   opening a new chapter. Under the impetus of its new France CEO, Edouard
   Hénaut, a new organisation is being set up with multiple objectives:
     * Strengthen the role of integrator of daily mobility solutions in
       the French regions;
     * Consolidate proximity and the knowledge of passengers and transit
       authorities;
     * Accelerate sales development;
     * Strengthen the client focus and collaboration.

   The anticipated acceleration in the pace of calls for tenders over the
   next five years, with strategic conquests and opportunities in the rail
   sector, requires Transdev France to undergo a fundamental
   transformation.

   With this new organization, we will further reinforce our preferred
   partnership status with the territories to develop an ever more
   innovative, accessible, sustainable mobility that cares about passenger
   well-being.
   Edouard Hénaut, CEO of Transdev France

   In order to improve performance and efficiency, Edouard Hénaut has
   decided to strengthen the link between the regions and the central
   offices, and thus to appoint Sylvain Picard, Deputy CEO. To round off
   this scheme on the opening-up to competition in the greater Paris
   region and for rail transport, Brice Bohuon is appointed CEO Greater
   Paris region and Rail Transport.

   The Transdev regions are managed, as closely as possible to the
   territorial challenges, by Sylvie Baqué for the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes
   region, Thierry Brunel for the Occitanie region, Vincent Destot for the
   Hauts-de-France region, Brigitte Guichard for the
   Bourgogne-Franche-Comté region, Sylvain Joannon for the South region,
   Gildas Lagadec for the Brittany and Pays de la Loire regions,
   Christophe Mallet for the Centre-Val de Loire region, Olivier Monnot
   for the Grand Est region (from end of August 2019), Pascal Morganti for
   the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region, Sylvain Picard for the Normandy region
   and Julien Tenenbaum for the Overseas Region.

   Salima Saa brings together and manages the Development and Commercial
   Department, including the Offers Department. The specific activities
   are managed by Xavier Heulin for the Parking activity, Julien Augerat
   for the Health activity and Vincent Cordonnier for Transamo, under the
   supervision of Edouard Hénaut.

   The central management is ensured by: Xavier Aymonod for the Passenger
   Customers department, Jean-Marc Bernini for B2B activities, Stephanie
   Zeppa for the Performance, Transformation and Information Systems
   department, Sylvain Picard for the Fleet Operations department, Pierre
   Talgorn for the Finance and Purchasing department and Hervé Baron for
   the Human Resources department. In addition to these areas of
   expertise, Elsa Laversanne is in charge of Communication, reporting to
   Pascale Giet, Group Communications Executive Vice-President.

   Transdev is an international public transport operator, born of the
   merger between Transdev and Veolia Transport. We design transport
   systems for all forms of public, shared, private, city and rural
   transport, dovetailed with mobility-friendly services such as
   applications that combine several transport options, the management of
   contactless payment systems on bus networks and the coordination of
   fleets of taxis and chauffeur-driven cars. Passenger transportation is
   the very essence of our company, which covers every sector: road
   transport with long-haul coaches, BRT, bus networks, rail and marine
   transportation and airports. As a group, Transdev believes that
   innovation is the key to supporting the changes in how people will use
   mobility in the future. Innovation is found in all of our business
   lines, including our research into energy and technological solutions
   such as the design of autonomous and digital vehicles.

   As the majority shareholder of Transdev, we welcome the arrival of
   RETHMANN Group, a long-term industrial partner, as a shareholder in
   Transdev. Our subsidiary will thus have all the assets to offer even
   more innovative mobility solutions in France that are adapted to all
   the specificities of the regions. RETHMANN Group's acquisition of this
   stake in the company will also strengthen its international dimension,
   making Transdev a true European mobility champion.
   Eric Lombard, CEO of Caisse des Dépôts Group


   Ludger Rethmann, Family owner and board member of RETHMANN Group  said:
   “We are extremely proud to start a new industrial partnership with
   Caisse des Depôts Group, with a key focus on developing Transdev, the
   leading company for mobility solutions. RETHMANN Group believes that
   climate change and the digital and collaborative transformations at
   work today will create and multiply new opportunities for mobility. We
   want to bring our expertise in international logistics and services to
   communities, and our long-term family-owned industrial model, to
   Transdev in order to develop custom-designed mobility solutions.”

   Thierry Mallet, Chairman and CEO of Transdev Group stated: “The
   presence of RETHMANN Group in the capital of Transdev, alongside
   majority shareholder Caisse des Dépôts Group, will allow us to
   accelerate our development. Our shareholders support our vision of a
   mobility which is ever more human, inclusive, innovative and
   sustainable. They will actively support our ambition as a global
   integrator of all mobilities. From now on, with RETHMANN Group, we will
   continue to accelerate on this trajectory.”


   In order to adapt the Group to the major changes affecting the public
   transportation field, whilst even better addressing the daily needs and
   expectations of our passengers, communities and business customers,
   Transdev is accelerating its transformation with its new “Moving You”
   strategy as a global integrator of mobility solutions. The evolution of
   Transdev’ shareholding structure reinforces and consolidates this
   strategy.

   In particular, Caisse des Dépôts Group, RETHMANN Group and Transdev
   share common values of long-term vision, partnership and local
   development.

Key elements of this partnership

1. Caisse des Dépôts Group maintains its control over Transdev

   Within this deal, Caisse des Dépôts Group will control Transdev with
   66% of the shares and more than two thirds of the voting rights. The
   Board of Directors would be made up of 11 members: six representing
   Caisse des Dépôts Group, one independent, one representing the
   employees, and three representing RETHMANN Group; reinforcing the
   international character of its governance.

   As the majority shareholder, Caisse des Dépôts Group further provides
   Transdev with solid, lasting support in its development, while actively
   supporting its ambitious industrial project in a sector in full
   transformation. This will allow Transdev to establish itself as the
   leader in sustainable mobility and new mobilities, in line with the
   strategic priorities of the Caisse des Dépôts Group, and in particular
   its positioning to support local communities and its support to
   development in all regions in France, where transportation is a key
   factor.

2. RETHMANN : a German industrial group, close to local communities and
active in transportation, the core business of Transdev

   RETHMANN Group is a 100% family-owned German service and utility group,
   which is investing in Transdev on a long-term perspective. It is among
   the world leaders in three activities: logistics and transportation –
   Transdev’s core business – with its subsidiary RHENUS (29,000
   employees), in water and recycling with its subsidiary REMONDIS (34,000
   employees) as well as in the field of bio-technologies with its
   subsidiary SARIA (9,000 employees). RETHMANN Group’s shareholding in
   Transdev would include the contribution to Transdev of its passenger
   public transportation activities in Germany, operated under the helm of
   RHENUS Veniro.

   With its 72,000 employees, revenues of 14.4 billion Euros (excl. public
   private partnerships) and 3 billion Euros equity, RETHMANN Group is a
   European champion, which is also successful on international markets:
   the Group is present in several hundred cities, over 4 continents and
   50 countries, with over 1,000 sites. This broad geographic coverage
   allows for the combination of a true international experience with a
   fine understanding of local issues and situations.

   RETHMANN Group, as a shareholder in over 50 public private partnerships
   (PPP) in Germany, is accustomed to partnerships with public entities
   and boasts an unrivalled experience in the fields of services to
   communities.

   RETHMANN Group is active in France since 1995 in its three activities
   where it reached revenues of 640 million Euros in 2017, employs some
   3,000 people over 60 sites in the country and intends to reinforce its
   presence through its shareholding in Transdev, of which 40% of the
   activity is in France.

3. Reinforcement of Transdev’s development strategy

   RETHMANN Group joining Transdev’s capital would reinforce and
   accelerate Transdev’s development strategy. In particular in Germany,
   with the contribution of the passenger public transportation activities
   (bus and rail), which are complementary to Transdev’s operations; and
   by RETHMANN Group’s presence in Eastern Europe and in Australia. This
   would also comfort its presence in France in bringing ever more
   innovative solutions adapted to the challenges of mobility.

   Through its subsidiary Rhenus Veniro, RETHMANN is active in public
   transportation: buses (urban, interurban) and rail. In buses, it is
   present in seven German “Länder” (States). In rail, it operates three
   regional train lines; in addition Rhenus Veniro operates public
   transportation services in the city of Zwickau. In total, this activity
   encompasses more than 2,200 employees, 1,617 buses, 32 tramways, eight
   regional trains, covering 65 million km and carrying over 100 million
   passengers per year.

   The contribution of these activities to Transdev would locally
   reinforce Transdev’s leading position in Germany, where it is already
   the first private regional rail operator, without impacting Transdev’s
   debt.

4. Reinforcement of Transdev’s international dimension, which already
represents over 60% of its business

   Transdev has strong ambitions for its activities in Germany, the second
   largest Transdev market in Europe, where the Group already generates
   revenues close to 900 million Euros and where it is the second player
   in the regional rail market after Deutsche Bahn, the traditional
   operator. Equally, Transdev has strong ambitions in Eastern Europe
   where RETHMANN Group is already solidly established.

5. RETHMANN Group would further contribute with key technologies, tools and
know-how in digital solutions, key assets for Transdev

   In line with Transdev’s innovation priorities, which are P.A.C.E.: i.e.
   personalized, autonomous, connected, electric and eco-friendly,
   RETHMANN Group invests heavily in key common innovation fields such as
   autonomous vehicles, digitalization, robotics and sustainable mobility.

   Transdev strives to always offer the best services and support to its
   customers – passengers, inhabitants, cities and regions, and businesses
   – in which they place their trust, with mobility solutions that are
   ever more human, inclusive, innovative and sustainable and adapted to
   their needs. Therefore, beyond its operator role, Transdev is becoming
   a global integrator of mobility solutions capable of answering to the
   daily needs of today and tomorrow. From now on, with RETHMANN Group,
   Transdev will continue to accelerate on this transformational path. The
   common ambition is to become the preferred partner for Public Transit
   Authorities and businesses.

   Transdev is an international public transport operator, born of the
   merger between Transdev and Veolia Transport. We design transport
   systems for all forms of public, shared, private, city and rural
   transport, dovetailed with mobility-friendly services such as
   applications that combine several transport options, the management of

   mobility in the future. Innovation is found in all of our business
