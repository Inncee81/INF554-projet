Leverage the new US International Development Finance Corporation to compete
with China

   The United States has a unique opportunity to up its game in the global
   economic competition with China. In early October, even as Democrats
   and Republicans in the Senate engaged in an unprecedented standoff over
   the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, they quietly came
   together to pass the Better Utilization of Investment Leading to
   Development (BUILD) Act, setting into motion the creation of a new U.S.
   International Development Finance Corporation (IDFC). The IDFC holds
   the potential to significantly boost America's economic edge against
   China - if the Trump administration and Congress make the right choices
   in the coming months.

   The stakes could not be higher. In recent years, China has advanced its
   influence across the developing world under the umbrella of what it
   calls "One Belt, One Road." This Belt and Road strategy envisions a
   world connected by a web of Chinese-funded physical and digital
   infrastructure. It has involved unprecedented resources: according to
   independent estimates, around $340 billion from 2014 to 2017.

   Marketed as Beijing's "gift to the world," the Belt and Road has in
   fact served to cement China's status as a global power by creating
   opportunities for overseas military access and promoting relationships
   of debt dependency - all while corroding existing international
   commercial standards and imperiling democracy in some countries.

   Recognizing that China's Belt and Road strategy is a power play
   intended to position Beijing to shape the course of the 21^st century,
   the United States this year has begun to formulate an economic
   response. However, a lack of resources has remained America's Achilles
   heel. When the Trump administration unveiled a series of new
   initiatives during its Indo-Pacific Business Forum this summer, the
   modest price tag - $113 million - failed to answer mounting questions
   from U.S. allies and partners about America's commitment to fund its
   international economic engagement, and elicited mockery from Beijing.

   Enter the new IDFC.

   Authorized by the bipartisan BUILD Act, the IDFC will more than double
   the lending capacity of the existing Overseas Private Investment
   Corporation (OPIC) - adding more than $30 billion to the resources by
   which the U.S. government can partner with private sector investors to
   support commercial projects in developing countries. Compared to OPIC,
   the IDFC will deploy a more expansive and flexible toolkit: it can take
   equity in overseas projects and work more freely with non-U.S.
   investors, and will also incorporate components of the U.S. Agency for
   International Development.

   The BUILD Act stipulates that U.S. policy seeks "to provide countries a
   robust alternative to state-directed investments by authoritarian
   governments," but gives the Trump administration and Congress
   significant latitude over the IDFC's future organization, staffing, and
   activities.

   An IDFC optimized to support U.S. competition with China should feature
   the following elements.

   First, the IDFC should include a new office for strategic investments.
   Overseen by a Vice President for National Security who would serve as a
   member of the IDFC's leadership team, this office would work with the
   private sector to catalyze investments in overseas infrastructure
   projects with significant geopolitical value, as determined by the U.S.
   Department of Defense and the U.S. Intelligence Community. The new
   office would also have responsibility for coordinating with ally and
   partner governments on joint infrastructure financing.

   Second, the IDFC should have the ability to take a degree of financial
   risk. To compete with China for strategic infrastructure projects
   across the developing world, the IDFC will have to encourage the U.S.
   private sector to operate in some countries where political instability
   and weak regulatory environments would normally deter investment. Some
   projects will succeed; others may fail. Although the IDFC must be
   judicious in its use of taxpayer resources, Congress should resist the
   urge to grade it by overall return on investment, as this will
   hamstring efforts to compete with China.

   Third, the IDFC should pursue a handful of large-scale, commercially
   viable infrastructure projects. Beijing has skillfully played up the
   size of its economic investment across the developing world, in part by
   pointing to mega-projects with symbolic value. America's economic
   engagement, by contrast, often takes less visible forms, even if U.S.
   companies do more to bolster local employment and transfer expertise. A
   small number of high-profile, U.S.-backed infrastructure projects in
   the Indo-Pacific, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America could
   become the core of a counter-narrative to China's Belt and Road
   strategy.

   Fourth, the IDFC should prioritize financing for digital
   infrastructure. China is making a play to dominate the information
   technology ecosystems of many developing countries. The consequences
   range from exporting elements of Beijing's domestic surveillance
   complex to obtaining data that will fuel China's artificial
   intelligence industry. American companies remain highly competitive in
   the digital domain, and with U.S. government support, could be
   incentivized to take on projects in countries where risks are immediate
   and reward more long term.

   The U.S. government will never match the level of resources that China
   has dedicated to its Belt and Road strategy. But with the new IDFC in
   place, it can compete by unlocking the resources of America's private
   sector and offering credible alternatives.

   With countries across the developing world increasingly concerned that
   Chinese investment translates into unsustainable debt, corruption, and
   an erosion of national sovereignty, the United States has arrived at a
   moment of strategic opportunity. Now is the time to seize it.

Andrew Yang: Democrats need to 'gravitate away from identity politics'

   By Marina Pitofsky Tweet Share Email

   Presidential hopeful and entrepreneur Andrew Yang said the Democratic
   Party must move away from identity politics to win the White House in
   2020.

   "I think it's a kind of stupid way to try to win elections. I think the
   Democratic Party needs to try to gravitate away from identity politics
   towards things that would actually bridge the gap," Yang said in a
   Friday interview on the Rubin Report, a YouTube Talk Show.

   Yang said he understands the "sentiment" motivating people to
   incorporate their identities into their political views, but he doesn't
   think it's "a great way to try and build consensus."

   "I understand people have different experiences. I've had different
   experiences, but if we're going to solve some of these problems, we
   have to emphasize the things that will bring us together and not the
   things that are going to make us seem like we're living different
   lives," Yang said.

   Host Dave Rubin asked Yang whether people who would make assumptions
   about Yang's politics or life because he is an Asian American bother
   him.

   "My parents came here to have a better life for me and my brother and
   it's worked, and now I'm trying to give back," Yang said. "I want to
   try and make this country stronger so that my kids and other people's
   kids grow up in a country that we're all still excited about, and we do
   not have that much time to make that happen because things are coming
   apart very quickly."

   South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, another 2020 hopeful, also drew
   criticism when speaking at an LGBT gala in Las Vegas last month for
   saying identity politics as contributed to a "crisis of belonging" in
   the United States and that it has "divided and carved" Americans.

NASA's Bridenstine gives SpaceX a reality check

   Getty Images
   By Mark R. Whittington, opinion contributor The views expressed by
   contributors are their own and not the view of The Hill Tweet Share
   Email

   SpaceX CEO Elon Musk is a lot of things, mad genius, entrepreneur and
   visionary. He is also a master showman, as exemplified by his recent
   presentation of his plan to open up the moon, Mars and beyond to human
   settlement. The event took place in Boca Chica, Texas, close to where
   the Rio Grande empties into the Gulf of Mexico.

   Musk, among other people, has given that talk before, along with
   viewgraphs and animated videos. However, rhetoric about the high
   frontier of space takes on an extra resonance when the backdrop is an
   actual rocket ship.

   And, what a rocket ship! The Starship MK 1 stood beneath the Texas sky,
   made of gleaming stainless steel and heady dreams about a future better
   than the present, like something from a 1950s science fiction movie.

   The stainless-steel rocket will fly to a height of 12 miles before,
   hopefully, landing again in the next two months. Later versions will
   fly to orbit and, according to Musk, to the moon and Mars. The
   envisioned schedule is breathtaking in its ambition which, if achieved
   with even some delays, will make the decade of the 2020s into a turning
   point in human history.

   One-part dose of reality and one-part casting of shade came from NASA
   Administrator Jim Bridenstine. He offered an admonishment in the form
   of a tweet the day before Musk's presentation.

   "I am looking forward to SpaceX announcement tomorrow. In the meantime,
   Commercial Crew is years behind schedule. NASA expects the same level
   of enthusiasm focused on the investments of the American taxpayer. It
   is time to deliver."

   Bridenstine is referring to a project assigned to both SpaceX and
   Boeing to create crewed spacecraft that will take astronauts to and
   from the International Space Station. Both spacecraft have faced
   delays, which tends to show that Musk, for all of his talents, is not a
   magician. The problems facing Commercial Crew provide a reality check
   on SpaceX's breakneck schedule to make Starship a functioning space
   vehicle.

   Social media exploded with a lot of snark referring to NASA's rocket to
   the moon and Mars, the Space Launch System, which has cost over $10
   billion, has taken about 10 years to develop so far, and is years away
   from its first flight. The criticism is fair, though it should be
   pointed out that the decisions about the SLS and the attending problems
   surrounding the project predate Bridenstine's tenure as NASA
   administrator. He is moving as expeditiously as possible to get the SLS
   back on schedule.

   The dichotomy between the Starship's rapid development and the plodding
   Space Launch System points to how differently the two projects get
   their funding. Elon Musk is answerable only to his investors for how
   much and when he spends money. NASA has to answer to Congress, which,
   as Ars Technica points out, is not always sensible about how it doles
   out money.

   Congress presents a problem in how NASA conducts space exploration
   because of how the two legislative branches have chosen to deal with
   the Trump administration's request for extra money, including $1.6
   billion in the new fiscal year, to accelerate the next human moon
   landing to 2024. So far, the House has provided zero funding and the
   Senate less than requested.

   Of the billion or so dollars requested to get a crewed lunar lander
   started, the Senate has offered $744 million which, according to Space
   News, would impact the scale and number of awards NASA can dole out to
   various companies to get the project started. Ironically, the same
   Senate bill grants $300 million to get an Exploration Upper Stage for
   the SLS started, which NASA says it doesn't need right now.

   One way Bridenstine can make up for the shortfall is to have commercial
   partners invest more money in the lunar landers they propose. SpaceX
   has already done so, with the stainless-steel Starship, which could
   become, in one form, a way to get NASA astronauts to the lunar surface.
   SpaceX's main rival, Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin, has also poured money
   into its lunar lander, dubbed Blue Moon.

   Congress, by playing games with NASA's lunar lander funding, may have
   ironically enabled the early development of commercial moon ships. That
   means that the stainless-steel Starship, which Bridenstine fears is a
   distraction from the Commercial Crew project, may prove to be the
   salvation of NASA's aspirations to return to the moon by 2024.

   So Hard to Go Back to the Moon? as well as "The Moon, Mars and Beyond."

Additional vaping-related deaths bring total to 16 dead across 13 states

   Getty Images
   By John Bowden Tweet Share Email

   The number of deaths tied to vaping has climbed to 16 across the
   country.

   State officials in Nebraska, New Jersey and Virginia each reported a
   death this week, though the death in Nebraska reportedly occurred in
   May and was only recently revealed to have been caused by a severe lung
   disease thought to have been brought on by excessive vape usage.

   The three deaths were all the first reports of such cases in their
   respective states, according to statements from local officials.

   "I am deeply saddened to announce the first death of a Virginia
   resident related to this outbreak. Our thoughts are with the family
   during this difficult time," said Virginia state Health Commissioner M.
   Norman Oliver said Tuesday.

   "The New Jersey Department of Health is saddened to announce a death
   associated with this outbreak. This death underscores the potential
   dangers associated with vaping," said New Jersey Department of Health
   acting Commissioner Judith Persichilli in a press release.

   Nebraska officials said in a Monday news release that the state and
   others were working to determine if other deaths related to vape usage
   occurred before Nebraska began tracking the issue this year.

   "Prior to the outbreak of lung injury associated with vaping in
   Wisconsin and Illinois this past August, vaping-associated lung
   injuries were unreported and not tracked by public health agencies,"
   said Tom Safranek, Nebraska's state epidemiologist.

   "Once the problem was recognized, states quickly ramped up surveillance
   and found current cases, but have also discovered cases that occurred
   before the August outbreak," he added.

   Health officials are unsure what directly links e-cigarette use to lung
   illnesses reported in states across the country and have warned
   consumers to only purchase from reputable buyers.
