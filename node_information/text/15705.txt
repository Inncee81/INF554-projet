Parliament calls for stricter controls over surveillance tech exports

   The European Parliament gave the green light on Tuesday (8 September)
   to a non-binding resolution calling for safeguards to ensure technology
   isn’t implicated in human rights abuse, especially when it’s exported
   outside of Europe for surveillance or censorship purposes. A European
   Commission proposal is expected next year.

   Yesterday’s vote came two months after it was first scheduled. In July,
   Dutch MEP Marietje Schaake (Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for
   Europe), the author of the own initiative report, asked to have the
   vote postponed at short notice.

   Schaake told EURACTIV at the time that she didn’t have the support to
   bring the report to plenary.

   The surveillance report finally faced the first plenary session after
   the summer break and was approved with 371 votes in favour, 293 against
   and 43 abstentions yesterday afternoon in Strasbourg.

   MEPs approved the entire text, but Schaake said her report is still a
   lightening rod for criticism. A number of lawmakers, especially from
   the centre-right European People’s Party (EPP) and Conservatives and
   Reformist (ECR) groups in Parliament, disagree with her position on
   Europe’s complicity in surveillance.

   “Unfortunately there are still quite a few people who see security and
   human rights as zero-sum,” Schaake told EURACTIV.

   “The conservative side of the European Parliament did not want to
   condemn the role EU-based companies play, and also did not support the
   text that emphasized the need for strong encryption in the interest of
   securing data and the people communicating,” the lawmaker said.

   Checks on software

   The report spells out recommendations to make sure technology isn’t
   used in or outside Europe to abuse human rights. Institutions should
   issue checks on exports of software that can be used for surveillance
   or to censor or block internet activity, the report recommends.

   Schaake’s report calls for safeguards to encryption technology, which
   have come under fire from British Prime Minister David Cameron, and
   other officials, who call privacy techniques that leave no backdoor for
   law enforcement a threat to security.

   plan

   The report also says EU member states’ cooperation with US surveillance
   agencies to spy on citizens “has caused serious damage to the
   credibility of the EU’s human rights policy and has undermined global
   trust in the benefits of ICTs”.

   “The credibility of Europe’s foreign policy is undermined directly when
   an Italian company unjustly gets a license to sell to Sudan or Russia
   or when a French company sells digital keys to open any door, even the
   ones we may think are protected or locked by passwords or much stronger
   measures,” Schaake said during Monday’s debate in Strasbourg.

   Milan-based company Hacking Team was itself the victim of hacking in
   July, when invoices and internal emails were leaked, showing the firm’s
   sales of software that can be used for surveillance to countries such
   as Sudan, Russia and Turkey.

   Some EU member states also purchased software from Hacking Team,
   leading to the resignation of Maltese intelligence agency chief Andreas
   Pentaras in July.

   Dual use technology

   Earlier this summer, Schaake told EURACTIV that there should be EU-wide
   rules on export licences.

   The European Commission is reviewing the dual use regulation this year,
   which sets out rules for the export of products that can potentially be
   used for military purposes.

   German Minister of Economics Sigmar Gabriel signed off on a national
   law in July instituting stricter export controls for surveillance
   technology. Gabriel has been pushing for EU-wide laws to limit the
   export on dual use technology.

   controls

   “In addition to country-specific sanctions, the European Union is
   reviewing its export controls to prevent exports of sensitive
   technologies that could be misused in violation of human rights,”
   Commission Vice President Frans Timmermans said during Monday’s debate.

   Timmermans was in Strasbourg for a Commissioners’ college meeting on
   the sidelines of the plenary session.

   Commission proposal due next year

   “We’ve introduced in December 2014 new controls on exports of intrusion
   software and internet monitoring technologies. We are further exploring
   options to extend export controls to rapidly evolving cybersurveillance
   technologies that might be used for internet monitoring and/or
   telecommunications surveillance in violation of human rights,” he
   added.

   Schaake said many of the Commission’s measures to control the export of
   surveillance technology needed prodding from the Parliament.

   “There is still a huge amount of work that needs to be done before the
   EU has the relevant policies in place to deal with both the
   opportunities and the risks that are caused by the availability of new
   technologies,” she said.

   “A proposal for new legislation is now finally expected at the start of
   2016, which is welcome, but still long overdue. It will always prove
   difficult to make sure that the legislative process keeps up with
   technological developments, especially when it regards the internet,
   but on this issue it is safe to say that we are seriously lagging
   behind.”

Background

   The European Commission is reviewing the dual use regulation, which
   lays down the legislative framework for the export of products that can
   be used as weapons. A vote on a report by Dutch Liberal MEP Marietje
   Schaake on export controls for surveillance technology was postponed
   from July until September 2015.

   The quiet rise of Ursula von der Leyen

   German defence minister Ursula von der Leyen, a compromise name for the
   next  European Commission President, is a non-divisive political figure
   on EU stage and quiet tactician hardly known outside Germany. But her
   career at home has often been marked by scandals.

   EU leaders agree on top job picks but trouble already looms

   The European Council finally agreed on a pick for the Commission
   presidency and rallied behind Germany’s Ursula von der Leyen on Tuesday
   (2 July). But it sets up a potentially ugly encounter with the European
   Parliament, which might not sanction her appointment.

   Europe’s complicity in surveillance.

   “Unfortunately there are still quite a few people who see security and
   human rights as zero-sum,” Schaake told EURACTIV.

   “The conservative side of the European Parliament did not want to
   condemn the role EU-based companies play, and also did not support the
   text that emphasized the need for strong encryption in the interest of
   securing data and the people communicating,” the lawmaker said.

   Checks on software

   The report spells out recommendations to make sure technology isn’t
   used in or outside Europe to abuse human rights. Institutions should
   issue checks on exports of software that can be used for surveillance
   or to censor or block internet activity, the report recommends.

   Schaake’s report calls for safeguards to encryption technology, which
   have come under fire from British Prime Minister David Cameron, and
   other officials, who call privacy techniques that leave no backdoor for
   law enforcement a threat to security.

   The report also says EU member states’ cooperation with US surveillance
   agencies to spy on citizens “has caused serious damage to the
   credibility of the EU’s human rights policy and has undermined global
   trust in the benefits of ICTs”.

   “The credibility of Europe’s foreign policy is undermined directly when
   an Italian company unjustly gets a license to sell to Sudan or Russia
   or when a French company sells digital keys to open any door, even the
   ones we may think are protected or locked by passwords or much stronger
   measures,” Schaake said during Monday’s debate in Strasbourg.

   Milan-based company Hacking Team was itself the victim of hacking in
   July, when invoices and internal emails were leaked, showing the firm’s
   sales of software that can be used for surveillance to countries such
   as Sudan, Russia and Turkey.

   Some EU member states also purchased software from Hacking Team,
   leading to the resignation of Maltese intelligence agency chief Andreas
   Pentaras in July.

   Dual use technology

   Earlier this summer, Schaake told EURACTIV that there should be EU-wide
   rules on export licences.

   The European Commission is reviewing the dual use regulation this year,
   which sets out rules for the export of products that can potentially be
   used for military purposes.

   German Minister of Economics Sigmar Gabriel signed off on a national
   law in July instituting stricter export controls for surveillance
   technology. Gabriel has been pushing for EU-wide laws to limit the
   export on dual use technology.

   “In addition to country-specific sanctions, the European Union is
   reviewing its export controls to prevent exports of sensitive
   technologies that could be misused in violation of human rights,”
   Commission Vice President Frans Timmermans said during Monday’s debate.

   Timmermans was in Strasbourg for a Commissioners’ college meeting on
   the sidelines of the plenary session.

   Commission proposal due next year

   “We’ve introduced in December 2014 new controls on exports of intrusion
   software and internet monitoring technologies. We are further exploring
   options to extend export controls to rapidly evolving cybersurveillance
   technologies that might be used for internet monitoring and/or
   telecommunications surveillance in violation of human rights,” he
   added.

   Schaake said many of the Commission’s measures to control the export of
   surveillance technology needed prodding from the Parliament.

   “There is still a huge amount of work that needs to be done before the
   EU has the relevant policies in place to deal with both the
   opportunities and the risks that are caused by the availability of new
   technologies,” she said.

   “A proposal for new legislation is now finally expected at the start of
   2016, which is welcome, but still long overdue. It will always prove
   difficult to make sure that the legislative process keeps up with
   technological developments, especially when it regards the internet,
   but on this issue it is safe to say that we are seriously lagging
   behind.”

Background

   The European Commission is reviewing the dual use regulation, which
   lays down the legislative framework for the export of products that can
   be used as weapons. A vote on a report by Dutch Liberal MEP Marietje
   Schaake on export controls for surveillance technology was postponed
   from July until September 2015.

   next  European Commission President, is a non-divisive political figure
   on EU stage and quiet tactician hardly known outside Germany. But her

   EU leaders agree on top job picks but trouble already looms

   The European Council finally agreed on a pick for the Commission
   presidency and rallied behind Germany’s Ursula von der Leyen on Tuesday
   (2 July). But it sets up a potentially ugly encounter with the European
   Parliament, which might not sanction her appointment.
