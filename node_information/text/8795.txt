How digital transformation opened new channels for growth

With help from EY professionals, Royal Caribbean’s digital-first approach is
transforming their business and the cruising experience.

   The better the question. The better the answer. The better the world
   works.

How can technology transform the business of adventure?

Across its family of brands, Royal Caribbean prided itself on leading-edge
innovation in ship design. It was time to bring the guest experience into the
Transformative Age.

Cruise guests want maximum fun with minimum hassle

   Time is precious, now more than ever. Almost every minute is assigned
   and accounted for in the hustle and bustle of the day.

   So when people get a chance to take a holiday from their busy lives,
   they want a frictionless experience that supersizes the vacation fun
   and minimizes the hassle factor. They want a feeling of being away
   while at the same time having all the connected comforts of home.

   For Royal Caribbean, this meant redesigning the entire customer journey
   and introducing a range of integrated technologies to bring the guest
   experience into the Transformative Age.

     We’re always thinking about tomorrow, and that requires constantly
     looking to be the disruptor, not the disruptee.

   Jason Liberty
   EVP & CFO, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.

Royal Caribbean saw an opportunity to provide a fully integrated
shore-to-ship digital experience

   Involving everything from zip lines to flow riding to ice skating,
   Royal Caribbean’s ship design has always been at the leading edge of
   innovation to attract a growing number of cruise passengers (from 17.8
   million per year in 2009 to an expected 27.2 million in 2018). However,
   in looking at industries such as amusement parks, casinos and airlines,
   which have been offering mobile check-in and bespoke apps to customers
   for years, Royal Caribbean realized it had an opportunity to improve
   its ability to offer guests a fully integrated shore-to-ship digital
   experience.

   The rapid pace of digital transformation has led to heightened customer
   expectations— and organizations know they need to innovate if they want
   to keep up. EY findings show that 50% of CEOs do not believe their
   companies have implemented the necessary steps to counter disruption.
   Failure to do so can put market leadership and capitalization at risk.

   The risk of being disrupted
   50%

   of CEOs do not believe their companies have implemented the necessary
   steps to counter disruption.

   To remain competitive on every level, Royal Caribbean recognized it
   needed to deliver a seamless connected experience on land and at sea
   that allowed their guests to get the most from their cruise experience.
   Understanding it needed the right partner, Royal Caribbean looked to EY
   professionals to help it cruise into the digital age.

Digital doesn’t disrupt our business but accelerates our business.

   Jay Schneider

   SVP, Digital, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.


Moving from analog to digital required a radical technological rethink

   When EY came onboard, Royal Caribbean was still in the early stages of
   its digital thinking. Guests had limited visibility to activities and
   amenities through a web portal and a minimalist app. Once aboard, they
   received a daily printed newsletter detailing the events, activities,
   restaurants and menus, shore excursions and ports of call for the day.
   Further, to participate in an event or excursion, guests had to line up
   and sign up with the crew on a first-come, first-served basis.

   This analog approach was limiting, particularly for generations who
   were more accustomed to a digital-first mindset and were looking for a
   more streamlined and frictionless experience.

   “People today expect the ease of technology in everything they do,”
   says Richard Fain, Chairman and CEO of Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.
   “They find it saves them time and effort, especially when on vacation,
   where time is one of the most important commodities they have.”

This was an opportunity for Royal Caribbean to think differently about
connecting with their guests, with their employees and also with new revenue
streams.

   Raj Mirchandani

   EY Advisory Account Leader for Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.


   “This was an opportunity for Royal Caribbean to think differently about
   connecting with their guests, with their employees and also with new
   revenue streams,” Raj Mirchandani, EY Advisory Account Leader for Royal
   Caribbean Cruises Ltd., explains. “Done right, this could lead to new
   ways of operating that provide not just what today’s digitally savvy
   customers expect, but something that fundamentally changes their
   perception of what it means to go on a cruise.”

   Of course, developing a digital experience that worked on ship and
   shore, across a fleet of 40 ships, was no easy task. The EY team needed
   to think about digital from every angle throughout the company’s entire
   business.

   works.

Providing experiences on-demand that are available with a click and a swipe

Out front and behind the scenes, the EY team is helping Royal Caribbean give
guests control over every aspect of their voyage.

Facial recognition that speeds up boarding is just one feature of a new
seamless customer experience

   “Often, EY clients will come to us, and they’ll say, ‘We want to
   rethink the customer experience in a new digital way,’” says Cheryl
   Grise, EY Advisory Lead, Southeast Region. “And as you start to probe
   and ask more questions, you realize they’re saying a lot more than
   that. What we learned is that Royal Caribbean wasn’t just asking for
   the customer experience to be digitized; they were also asking how to
   become a fully equipped digital organization.”

   From having guests check in using facial recognition to facilitate
   faster boarding; to informing them via text that their luggage had
   safely arrived in their stateroom; to exploring, planning and booking
   activities through an app that puts every onboard adventure for every
   age at guests’ fingertips, the EY team is helping Royal Caribbean
   create a seamless customer experience.

The guest experience gets a digital facelift

   EY and Royal Caribbean professionals used data and analytics to create
   a personalization engine that gives guests mobile control over many
   different touchpoints in their cruising experience. Through the
   personalization engine, the app learns, tracks and helps crews respond
   to passenger preferences from the moment of boarding, providing
   recommendations based on their behavior so that guests can enjoy the
   adventure on their own terms.

   Behind the scenes, teams of EY and Royal Caribbean technology, digital
   and business professionals worked together to solve the challenges
   associated with creating an uninterrupted digital experience, whether
   it was onshore through fiber optics, or through satellites while at
   sea.

Innovative digital technology works to detangle layers of backend legacy IT
systems

   As part of an evolutionary rebuild, EY professionals initially focused
   on reconfiguring Royal Caribbean’s IT systems so that they could
   recognize each guest as an individual, authenticate and offer
   intelligent personalization, and customize every aspect of their
   itinerary. The teams used mobile, cloud, machine learning, and data
   analytics technologies to detangle a complex, layered legacy technology
   infrastructure. The result — a rebuilt IT platform that is modern,
   scalable and resilient.

Intelligent personalization and integrated automation provide a more
profitable cruising experience

   What this means in real terms is that once a guest has downloaded the
   app, snapped a selfie and turned on their Bluetooth, the new app uses
   integrated automation and intelligent personalization to let them
   explore activities they’d be likely to enjoy. The app also allows
   guests to do things like pull up a drink menu and input an order, which
   a cruise employee later delivers directly to them with the help of
   beacon technology. In addition, based on information guests input into
   the app, it can automatically alert servers to any food sensitivities
   and allergies so that guests won’t have to worry about their health and
   safety while onboard.

   The better the question. The better the answer. The better the world

The whole journey–transformed

Royal Caribbean’s digital transformation helps families have the best
vacation time of their lives.

Beyond technology, Royal Caribbean reimagines its operating model to deliver
experiences on-demand.

   For Royal Caribbean, digital transformation means more than developing
   an app or deploying digital technology. It’s about changing the entire
   operating model and creating a digital mindset across the organization
   that focuses on providing a frictionless experience in every
   interaction for every guest.

   The EY team positioned Royal Caribbean’s digital transformation journey
   to begin by looking first at the guest and employee experiences,
   developing a digital vision for the enterprise and making incremental
   changes to each. This will evolve to cover the whole end-to-end
   cruising experience — from booking to boarding to cruising. Meanwhile,
   the EY and Royal Caribbean teams are considering the employee
   experience and how Royal Caribbean can give them greater levels of
   engagement with purpose, as well as the digitally connected advantages
   cruise guests now enjoy.

If I do my job right, you won’t even notice the technology. You’ll just
notice really amazing experiences.

   Joey Hasty

   Innovation and Transformation Lead, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.


EY helps Royal Caribbean take a digital transformation journey that allows
guests to enjoy their adventure, their way

   When holiday-seekers set about booking a vacation, they are often
   overworked, overloaded and overtired. Their vacation is a chance to
   leave that burden behind — as much as they can.

   With the EY team’s help, Royal Caribbean was able to realize its
   objective of offering guests a fully integrated shore-to-ship digital
   experience. A redesigned terminal experience supports facial
   recognition for faster boarding so that guests can start vacationing
   earlier. Integrated automation and intelligent personalization improve
   guest satisfaction, increase onboard revenue and lower costs.

   Royal Caribbean’s digital transformation journey is a win-win for
   cruise guests and the company’s bottom line. Seamless, personalized
   experiences allow guests to enjoy their adventure, their way, while new
   in-app revenue opportunities lead the way for more profitable growth.

   a cruise employee later delivers directly to them with the help of
   beacon technology. In addition, based on information guests input into
   the app, it can automatically alert servers to any food sensitivities
   and allergies so that guests won’t have to worry about their health and
   safety while onboard.

   The better the question. The better the answer. The better the world
   works.

The whole journey–transformed

Royal Caribbean’s digital transformation helps families have the best
vacation time of their lives.

Beyond technology, Royal Caribbean reimagines its operating model to deliver
experiences on-demand.

   For Royal Caribbean, digital transformation means more than developing
   an app or deploying digital technology. It’s about changing the entire
   operating model and creating a digital mindset across the organization
   that focuses on providing a frictionless experience in every
   interaction for every guest.

   The EY team positioned Royal Caribbean’s digital transformation journey
   to begin by looking first at the guest and employee experiences,
   developing a digital vision for the enterprise and making incremental
   changes to each. This will evolve to cover the whole end-to-end
   cruising experience — from booking to boarding to cruising. Meanwhile,
   the EY and Royal Caribbean teams are considering the employee
   experience and how Royal Caribbean can give them greater levels of
   engagement with purpose, as well as the digitally connected advantages
   cruise guests now enjoy.

If I do my job right, you won’t even notice the technology. You’ll just
notice really amazing experiences.

EY helps Royal Caribbean take a digital transformation journey that allows
guests to enjoy their adventure, their way

   When holiday-seekers set about booking a vacation, they are often
   overworked, overloaded and overtired. Their vacation is a chance to
   leave that burden behind — as much as they can.

   With the EY team’s help, Royal Caribbean was able to realize its
   objective of offering guests a fully integrated shore-to-ship digital
   experience. A redesigned terminal experience supports facial
   recognition for faster boarding so that guests can start vacationing
   earlier. Integrated automation and intelligent personalization improve
   guest satisfaction, increase onboard revenue and lower costs.

   Royal Caribbean’s digital transformation journey is a win-win for
   cruise guests and the company’s bottom line. Seamless, personalized
   experiences allow guests to enjoy their adventure, their way, while new
   in-app revenue opportunities lead the way for more profitable growth.
