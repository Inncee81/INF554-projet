    I love how adding paint to furniture can easily give an updated look.
   It’s easy to modernize an outdated buffet with custom green paint or

   wanted to make a statement as we welcomed new guests into the guest
   suite.   This is how she looked when I…

   Do you have a hard time figuring out what to call your decorating
   style?  It used to be so simple because there were only a handful of

   Have you noticed the decorating trend of having bed runners or bed
   scarfs at the foot of the beds?  This is sometimes to replace a throw
   blanket or a heavy quilt.  You may have noticed them initially in hotel

   Have you ever thought about buying kitchen cabinets online?  Like most

   Where do I begin on sharing the modern kitchen makeover for the guest

Modernize an outdated buffet -custom deep green paint

   12 Sep

    I love how adding paint to furniture can easily give an updated look.
   It’s easy to modernize an outdated buffet with custom green paint or
   any paint for that matter.  This is our entryway to our Airbnb and I
   wanted to make a statement as we welcomed new guests into the guest
   suite.   This is how she looked when I…

Modern Transitional Living Room Design-Touches of Vintage for the Airbnb

   Decorating· HOFHideaway· My Home
   22 Aug

   Do you have a hard time figuring out what to call your decorating
   style?  It used to be so simple because there were only a handful of
   categories.  Now with today’s trends, you have so many different names
   of a design style and a lot of those names pretty much mean the same
   thing, it gets confusing.  Well, I am…

DIY Fabric Placemat Pillow Shams for the Guest Suite

   Decorating· DIY Projects· HOFHideaway· Home Decor
   8 Aug

   Have you noticed the decorating trend of having bed runners or bed
   scarfs at the foot of the beds?  This is sometimes to replace a throw
   blanket or a heavy quilt.  You may have noticed them initially in hotel

   for the bed in the guest suite. …

   25 Jul

   Have you ever thought about buying kitchen cabinets online?  Like most
   people, I am sure you have your reasons why you decided not to hit the
   buy button.  I shopped both online and local for the kitchen cabinets
   in our guest suite.  I ended up buying online over the box store for
   many reasons and I want to share my…

Modern Kitchen Makeover for the Guest Suite

   DIY Projects· HOFHideaway· My Home
   11 Jul

   Where do I begin on sharing the modern kitchen makeover for the guest
   suite?  The only thing that we used from the original kitchen was the
   location of the plumbing.  I never know what image to share first, the
   before or after as to which one will make the bigger impact.  Either
   way, stick around so you can see the…

   Have you ever stayed in a perfect place that was warm, inviting and
   made you want to stay there forever?  You enjoyed your day touring the

   Is your entryway lacking an inviting appeal?  Do your guests walk into
   your home and are greeted with clutter and chaos? Your entryway
   immediately sets the tone for all guests who walk into your home, what

   Are you ready for a change in your dining room?  Have you tried to add
   in new accessories and your dining room still falls short on how you
   want it to look?   Sometimes we spend way too much time and money to
