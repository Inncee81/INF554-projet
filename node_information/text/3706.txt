Significance

   Nanoparticle-mediated delivery of siRNA to hepatocytes has treated
   disease in humans. However, systemically delivering RNA drugs to
   nonliver tissues remains an important challenge. To increase the number
   of nanoparticles that could be studied in vivo, we designed a
   high-throughput method to measure how >100 nanoparticles delivered mRNA
   that was translated into functional protein in vivo. We quantified how
   >250 lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) delivered mRNA in vivo, identifying two
   LNPs that deliver mRNA to endothelial cells. One of the LNPs
   codelivered Cas9 mRNA and single-guide RNA in vivo, leading to
   endothelial cell gene editing. This approach can identify nanoparticles
   that target new cells.

Abstract

   Dysfunctional endothelium causes more disease than any other cell type.
   Systemically administered RNA delivery to nonliver tissues remains
   challenging, in large part because there is no high-throughput method
   to identify nanoparticles that deliver functional mRNA to cells in
   vivo. Here we report a system capable of simultaneously quantifying how
   >100 lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) deliver mRNA that is translated into
   functional protein. Using this system (named FIND), we measured how
   >250 LNPs delivered mRNA to multiple cell types in vivo and identified
   7C2 and 7C3, two LNPs that efficiently deliver siRNA, single-guide RNA
   (sgRNA), and mRNA to endothelial cells. The 7C3 delivered Cas9 mRNA and
   sgRNA to splenic endothelial cells as efficiently as hepatocytes,
   distinguishing it from LNPs that deliver Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA to
   hepatocytes more than other cell types. These data demonstrate that
   FIND can identify nanoparticles with novel tropisms in vivo.

   A lipid nanoparticle (LNP) siRNA therapy targeted to hepatocytes (1, 2)
   has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This
   advance is exciting, but its long-term implications are tempered by the
   fact that clinical LNP therapies have targeted hepatocytes (when
   administered systemically) (1, 3) and muscle (when administered
   locally) (4). In mice, nanoparticles have delivered Cas9 mRNA and
   ribonucleoproteins via systemic or local injection (5⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓–12).
   Systemically administered Cas9 delivery to nonliver tissues remains a
   challenge. When LNPs are administered systemically, they display an
   affinity for the liver; this is thought to be driven by natural
   physiological advantages including slow blood flow (13, 14) and
   discontinuous vasculature in hepatic sinusoids (15). One additional
   reason most LNPs target the liver may be the process by which they are
   selected. LNPs are screened in vitro before a few LNPs are tested in
   vivo. In vitro LNP delivery can predict in vivo LNP delivery to
   hepatocytes (16), but in vitro nanoparticle can be a poor predictor of
   in vivo delivery to endothelial cells and macrophages (17). Moreover,
   LNP siRNA delivery is often tested in vivo using the FVII assay, which
   predicts hepatocyte delivery; this assay is enhanced by its ease, as
   well as the fact that validated, potent siRNA targeting FVII is
   available (18, 19). It is possible that LNPs target hepatocytes in part
   because established assays select for hepatocyte delivery.

   We reasoned that measuring hundreds of distinct LNPs in vivo would
   provide the best chance of identifying nanoparticles that deliver mRNA
   to new cell types. Using DNA barcodes (17, 20⇓–22), we previously
   quantified how >350 LNPs distributed in vivo. However, biodistribution
   is necessary, but not sufficient, for functional RNA delivery. Over 96%
   of RNA delivered into the endosome of a target cell can be degraded
   (23, 24), and cell-type-specific changes in endosomal escape are not
   understood (25). Thus, it is difficult to predict functional delivery
   using biodistribution. As a result, a high-throughput method to
   quantify functional, cytosolic delivery of mRNA in vivo could
   accelerate the discovery of clinically relevant LNPs.

   An ideal system would (i) enable scientists to test many LNPs
   simultaneously, (ii) utilize commonly available animal models, (iii)
   rely on a robust signal, and (iv) measure functional RNA delivery to
   any combinations of cell types in vivo. Measuring delivery to
   “on-target” cells and “off-target” cells would enable iterative screens
   to improve LNP specificity. We designed a system named Fast
   Identification of Nanoparticle Delivery (FIND) that meets these
   criteria. FIND measures cytosolic mRNA delivery by >100 LNPs in vivo to
   any combination of cell types. We quantified how >250 LNPs functionally
   delivered mRNA to multiple cell types in vivo and identified two
   formulations that deliver RNA to endothelial beds. FIND is a system
   that facilitates high-throughput screens of functional mRNA delivery
   and may identify LNPs with novel tropisms.

Results

   FIND combined rationally designed DNA barcodes and the Cre-Lox system
   to generate a multiplexed readout of functional mRNA delivery. FIND is
   distinct from previous barcoding systems we developed, which measure
   biodistribution (Fig. 1A). Using high-throughput microfluidics (26), we
   coformulated LNPs with Cre mRNA and a unique DNA barcode. LNP-1, with
   chemical structure 1, carried DNA barcode 1 and Cre mRNA; LNP-N, with
   chemical structure N, carried DNA barcode N and Cre mRNA (Fig. 1 A–C).
   We characterized the size and stability of each LNP using dynamic light
   scattering (DLS) and discarded LNPs that did not meet two criteria: (i)
   diameters between 20 and 200 nm and (ii) an autocorrelation curve with
   one inflection point (SI Appendix, Fig. S1A). LNPs that met these
   criteria were pooled together and administered to Lox-Stop-Lox-tdTomato
   (Ai14) mice (27). Ai14 cells fluoresce if Cre mRNA is translated into
   Cre protein, which then translocates to the nucleus and edits target
   DNA. We isolated tdTomato^+ cells with FACS and deep-sequenced the
   cells to identify LNPs that delivered mRNA. We reasoned the codelivery
   of mRNA and a 56-nt ssDNA could approximate the codelivery of an mRNA
   encoding a nuclease and guide RNA (28⇓–30). After sequencing tdTomato^+
   cells (Fig. 1C), we ranked LNPs by calculating the “normalized
   delivery” of each barcode. Normalized delivery is analogous to counts
   per million in RNA-sequencing data (Fig. 1D and SI Appendix, Fig. S1B).
   We used barcodes we previously described and validated with a number of
   control experiments (SI Appendix, Fig. S1 C–E) (17, 20, 21).

   FIND is a high-throughput screen for functional mRNA delivery. (A)
   Unlike previous biodistribution screens, which cannot distinguish
   between bound particles, particles stuck in endosomes, and particles
   that delivered RNA into the cytoplasm, FIND identifies LNPs that
   functionally deliver RNA. (B and C) Nanoparticles were formulated to
   carry Cre mRNA and a DNA barcode, before they were administered to Cre
   reporter cell lines or mice. Cells that underwent Cre-mediated genetic
   changes were isolated using FACS, and the DNA barcode was sequenced to
   identify the LNP that delivered the mRNA. (D) LNP barcodes were ranked
   by “normalized delivery”; each sample (e.g., lung 1 vs. heart 1) was
   analyzed individually on a single sequencing run. Using these data, we
   would hypothesize that LNP-1 delivered nucleic acids more efficiently
   to the lungs than LNP-2 and LNP-N. (E) LGSL-R cells were treated with
   naked Cre mRNA or Cre mRNA carrried by Lipofectamine 2000 (L2K). RFP
   expression indicates cytoplasmic Cre mRNA delivery. (F) Alexa 647 and
   RFP intensities after treatment with L2K carrying Cre mRNA and Alexa
   647-labeled DNA barcode. Compared with untreated cells, there are no
   Alexa 647-RFP+ cells, demonstrating that biodistribution is necessary,
   but not sufficient, for cytoplasmic delivery. (G) RFP+ HEK cells as a
   function of the administered Cre mRNA, which was delivered with L2K.
   (H) Normalized DNA barcode delivery for 54 LNPs sequenced from RFP+ HEK
   cells after the administration of 10 ng or 100 ng total mRNA. A high
   degree of correlation between samples suggests that LNPs which deliver
   mRNA at the first dose deliver mRNA at the second dose. (I) RFP+ HEK
   cells following the administration of 54 LNPs (100 ng total mRNA),
   after cells were treated with endocytosis inhibitors. n = 3–4 wells per
   group. **P < 0.01, ****P < 0.0001, two-tailed t test.

   We characterized FIND using in vitro and in vivo experiments. First, we
   cultured HEK.293 cells that expressed LoxP-GFP-Stop-LoxP-RFP (LGSL-RFP)
   under a CMV promoter (Fig. 1B). These cells became RFP^+ 72 h after
   treatment with Cre mRNA carried by Lipofectamine 2000 (L2K), but not
   with naked Cre mRNA, which served as the negative control (Fig. 1E and
   SI Appendix, Fig. S1F). The number of RFP^+ cells after L2K treatment
   increased with dose and time, up to 3 d (SI Appendix, Fig. S1G). We
   then coformulated L2K with Cre mRNA and an Alexa 647-labeled DNA
   barcode. After 24 h, 62, 36, 2, and 0% of the cells were 647^+RFP^−,
   647^+RFP^+, 647^−RFP^−, and 647^−RFP^+, respectively. This indicates
   that biodistribution is required, but not sufficient for functional
   cytosolic delivery, as we expected (Fig. 1F). Untreated cells—used to
   control for autofluorescence—were 647^−RFP^− (Fig. 1F and SI Appendix,
   Fig. S1H).

   We then formulated 54 chemically distinct LNPs (SI Appendix, Fig. S1 I
   and J) carrying Cre mRNA and a unique DNA barcode. We administered the
   LNPs to LGSL-RFP cells with mRNA doses of 10, 100, or 1,000 ng and an
   mRNA:DNA barcode mass ratio of 10:1. We observed a dose-dependent
   increase in RFP^+ cells, with over 80% of the cells RFP^+ 3 d after the
   1,000-ng transfection (Fig. 1G). We sequenced barcodes at all three
   doses, reasoning that barcode delivery at the lowest dose (4% RFP^+
   cells) would predict delivery at the middle dose (20% RFP^+ cells); we
   observed a strong correlation (R^2 > 0.9) between normalized delivery
   at 10-ng and 100-ng doses, suggesting this was the case (Fig. 1H). As a
   control, we sequenced cells treated with 1,000 ng mRNA; in this case,
   the system was saturated (>80% of the cells were RFP^+). As expected,
   the correlation between 1,000 ng and either 10 or 100 ng was weaker (SI
   Appendix, Fig. S1K) than the correlation between the two lower doses;
   importantly, these data indicate that FIND can become saturated as the
   percent of RFP^+ increases. Therefore, varying the dose by the potency
   of the nanoparticles pooled may be critical. We then evaluated whether
   the number of RFP^+ cells decreased after pretreatment with
   chlorpromazine, genistein, or ethylisopropyl amiloride (EIPA), which
   inhibit clathrin-, caveolin-, and macropinocytosis-mediated
   endocytosis, respectively. Compared with control cells that were not
   treated with inhibitors, RFP^+ cells decreased by 40–60%,
   recapitulating results previously obtained with individual LNPs (24,
   31) (Fig. 1I). Taken together, these results led us to conclude that
   FIND could analyze mRNA delivery in vitro.

   We investigated whether FIND could identify nanoparticles that deliver
   mRNA in vivo (Fig. 2 A and B). We formulated 112 LNPs, varying four
   chemical traits that influence LNP delivery in vitro: the lipid-amine
   compound, the molar amount of PEG, the structure of PEG, and the molar
   amount of cholesterol (Fig. 2C and SI Appendix, Fig. S2 A and B).
   Seventy-one LNPs met our two criteria for inclusion and were pooled
   (Fig. 2D). Naked DNA barcode, which should not be delivered as
   efficiently as DNA barcodes in LNPs, was included as a negative
   control. We i.v. injected the pooled LNPs and naked barcode into Ai14
   mice at a 1.5 mg/kg total mRNA dose (average dose 0.021 mg/kg per
   particle). Three days later, we isolated tdTomato^+ lung and kidney
   endothelial cells (tdTomato^+CD31^+CD45^−). Separately, we injected 1.0
   mg/kg total mRNA into mice intramuscularly and isolated immune
   (tdTomato^+CD45^+) and nonimmune (tdTomato^+CD45^−) cells from muscle.
   We gated on PBS-injected Ai14 mice for i.v. injected mice and the
   contralateral limb for intramuscular administration. It was important
   to gate on untreated Ai14 mice instead of C57BL/6J mice; gating on
   C57BL/6J mice could lead to inflated values of tdTomato^+ cells (SI
   Appendix, Fig. S2C). Separately, we administered the same LNPs to
   LGSL-RFP cells in vitro. Several lines of evidence suggested the data
   were robust. In all routes of administration, the naked barcode was
   delivered less efficiently than every LNP (Fig. 2E). Second, 7C1-based
   LNPs, which we previously optimized for in vivo RNA delivery (32), were
   enriched in the top 20% LNPs, compared with the other six lipid-amine
   compounds. (SI Appendix, Fig. S2 D and E). Finally, we reasoned that
   the route of administration would affect delivery; Euclidean
   clustering, a common bioinformatics technique (33) that compares how
   similar/dissimilar groups are to one another, and can be used to study
   nanoparticles in vivo (17, 20), separated intravenous, intramuscular,
   and in vitro delivery into three distinct clusters, as expected (Fig.
   2F).

   FIND can quantify LNP delivery in vivo. (A) Cre recombinase leads to
   the deletion of a stop codon allowing for the expression of tdTomato
   driven by a CAG promoter. (B) Libraries of LNPs containing Cre mRNA and
   DNA barcodes are administered to LSL-tdTom (Ai14) mice. tdTomato+ cells
   are isolated by FACS and DNA barcodes are sequenced. (C) Screen 1
   consisted of a library of 112 distinct LNPs created by formulating
   seven compounds with cholesterol, DOPE, and C14-PEG2000 at 16 different
   mole ratios. (D) DLS analysis of all 112 LNPs from this library; 71
   formed stable LNPs and were included. (E) Normalized DNA delivery in
   kidney and lung endothelial cells (CD31+CD45−) after LNPs were i.v.
   injected, as well as CD45+ and CD45− cells isolated following
   intramuscular injection. (F) In vivo LNP targeting heat map generated
   by unbiased, Euclidean clustering. In vitro LNP delivery, in vivo
   intramuscular delivery, and in vivo i.v. delivery cluster separately,
   as expected.

   We formulated a second LNP library to study how PEG, cholesterol, and
   helper lipids [e.g., dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE)] influence
   delivery to cells in vivo. We focused on 7C1-based LNPs, since 7C1 was
   enriched in the first screen. We varied the PEG molar amount, as well
   as the alkyl length on the PEG-lipid (SI Appendix, Fig. S2F).
   Seventy-eight out of 108 LNPs met our two criteria for inclusion; we
   i.v. administered the pool to the mice at a total mRNA dose of 1.5
   mg/kg. Three days later, we sequenced barcodes from tdTomato^+ lung and
   kidney endothelial cells. LNPs containing C[14] alkyl PEG were enriched
   in lung endothelial cells, whereas LNPs containing C[18] alkyl PEG were
   enriched in kidney endothelial cells (SI Appendix, Fig. S2 G and H). To
   validate the relationship between lung delivery, kidney delivery, and
   PEG structure, we formulated a third LNP library. We formulated 158
   LNPs designed to improve lung delivery relative to kidney delivery by
   only using C[14] alkyl-tail PEG varying helper lipid composition (SI
   Appendix, Fig. S2I). We found 3.75 times more lung endothelial cells
   were tdTomato^+ than kidney endothelial cells, a ratio that was
   significantly higher than the second screen (SI Appendix, Fig. S2J), as
   expected. Consistent with previous results (17, 20), we did not observe
   a relationship between LNP size and delivery to endothelial cells
   between the range of 20–200 nm (SI Appendix, Fig. S2K). The poor
   performance of the naked barcode, enrichment of 7C1, the fact that
   unbiased clustering separated the three routes of administration, and
   the PEG data convinced us FIND was capable of quantifying delivery in
   vivo.

   After completing these in vitro and in vivo validation experiments, we
   selected two LNPs (named 7C2 and 7C3) for more thorough
   characterization (Fig. 3 A and B and SI Appendix, Fig. S3 A and B). The
   7C2 was formulated with 7C1:cholesterol:C14-PEG2000:18:1 Lyso PC at a
   molar ratio of 50:23.5:6.5:20. The 7C3 was formulated with
   7C1:cholesterol:C14-PEG2000:DOPE at a molar ratio of 60:10:25:5. The
   7C2 and 7C3 formed stable LNPs with average diameters between 50 and 80
   nm when formulated with siRNA, single-guide RNA (sgRNA), or mRNA (SI
   Appendix, Fig. S3 C and D). The in vitro endocytosis and functional Cre
   mRNA delivery of both LNPs in LGSL-RFP cells decreased by at least 40%
   when cells were pretreated with chlorpromazine and genistein, relative
   to cells that were not treated with inhibitors. EIPA impacted LNP
   uptake but did not significantly decrease functional delivery in vitro
   (SI Appendix, Fig. S3 E–H). These results suggest 7C2 and 7C3 are
   endocytosed in vitro via several pathways. To study biodistribution,
   7C2 and 7C3 were formulated with a Cy5.5-conjugated DNA barcode and
   i.v. injected into separate mice at a dose of 0.75 mg/kg DNA. Three
   hours later—a time point that is sufficiently long for LNPs to be
   cleared from the blood (34)—Cy5.5 ex vivo fluorescence, normalized by
   tissue weight, was highest in the spleen, kidney, and liver, suggesting
   7C2 and 7C3 distributed to these tissues (Fig. 3C and SI Appendix, Fig.
   S3I).

   Characterization of lead nanoparticles discovered by FIND. (A) The top
   two particles, 7C2 and 7C3, discovered following three rounds of FIND
   are characterized by measuring biodistribution, delivery of siRNA,
   sgRNA. (B) The 7C2 and 7C3 were composed of 7C1 compound, cholesterol,
   C14-PEG2000, and helper lipids, 18:1 Lyso PC and DOPE, respectively.
   (C) Following a 0.75-mg/kg Barcode-Cy5.5 administration,
   biodistribution of 7C2 and 7C3 was quantified and normalized to tissue
   weight. n = 4 miceper group. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, two-way ANOVA. (D)
   Following a 1-mg/kg siICAM2 administration, both 7C2 and 7C3 induced
   ICAM2 protein silencing in endothelial cells by flow cytometry. The 7C2
   demonstrates more robust protein silencing in lung endothelial cells
   than 7C3. n = 4 mice per group. **P < 0.01, two tailed t test. (E–G)
   Following repeat administration of 7C2 and 7C3 at 1.5 mg/kg sgICAM2a
   and sgICAM2b, ICAM2 (E) protein and (F and G) indels were measured in
   endothelial cells isolated from multiple organs using FACS. n = 3–4
   mice per group. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, two-tailed t test.

   We tested whether 7C2 and 7C3 functionally delivered siRNA, sgRNA, and
   mRNA, which are all clinically relevant. We performed our individual
   LNP proof-of-concept experiments with nucleic acids targeting ICAM-2.
   We chose this target for three reasons. First, ICAM-2 is related to a
   number of inflammatory diseases (35, 36). Second, ICAM-2 expression is
   robust on endothelial cells. Third, there is a well-validated
   monoclonal antibody to ICAM-2, which allows us to quantify protein
   expression robustly using FACS.

   First, we formulated the LNPs to carry siRNA targeting ICAM-2. Three
   days after i.v. injecting mice with PBS, 2.0 mg/kg siGFP (a higher dose
   was used to test tolerability), or 1.0 mg/kg siICAM-2, we quantified
   ICAM-2 protein mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) in lung, kidney, and
   splenic endothelial cells using flow cytometry (32, 37). Both siRNAs
   were previously validated and chemically modified to reduce
   immunostimulation and promote on-target mRNA degradation (32, 37) (SI
   Appendix, Fig. S3J). ICAM-2 MFI was constant in PBS- and siGFP-treated
   mice but decreased by 60% in lung endothelial cells isolated from mice
   injected with siICAM-2. The 7C2-mediated delivery of siRNA reduced
   ICAM-2 expression in lung endothelial cells more than in splenic
   endothelial cells, whereas 7C3 silencing was more robust in splenic
   endothelial cells (Fig. 3D and SI Appendix, Fig. S3K). Compared with
   PBS-treated mice, mice injected with 2.0 mg/kg siGFP did not show any
   weight loss or changes in organ weight (SI Appendix, Fig. S3 L–N).

   We then quantified 7C2- and 7C3-mediated sgRNA delivery. We
   coformulated two sgRNAs that were chemically modified at the 5′ and 3′
   termini (38) and injected each at a dose of 0.75 mg/kg into mice that
   constitutively express SpCas9 (39) (SI Appendix, Fig. S3O). After three
   injections, ICAM-2 MFI decreased by up to 90, 75, and 59% in lung,
   spleen, and kidney endothelial cells, respectively for 7C2 (Fig. 3E).
   To confirm protein silencing was mediated by gene editing, we measured
   (40) ICAM-2 insertions and deletions (indels) in lung, spleen, and
   kidney endothelial cells and found between 30 and 70% editing per
   locus, leading to overall ICAM-2 indel percentages of 135, 95, and 123%
   indel, respectively for 7C2 (Fig. 3 F and G and SI Appendix, Fig. S3 P
   and Q). In these experiments, we utilized two sgRNAs per gene; thus,
   the total indel percentage was 200% (100% per site). Compared with PBS
   mice, mice treated with LNPs did not lose weight (SI Appendix, Fig. S3
   R and S). Based on these experiments, we concluded that 7C2 potently
   delivered small RNAs to pulmonary endothelial cells in vivo.

   In our siRNA and sgRNA experiments, 7C2 outperformed 7C3 and potently
   delivered RNAs to pulmonary endothelial cells. We then investigated
   whether the same observations were true for the delivery of large RNAs
   (mRNA). We formulated 7C2 and 7C3 to carry Cre mRNA and injected the
   LNPs into separate mice at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg mRNA (Fig. 4A). Three
   days later, we isolated tdTomato^+ immune cells and endothelial cells
   from the spleen, kidney, heart, lung, and liver, as well as
   hepatocytes. We made two interesting observations. First, contrasting
   the small RNA delivery experiments, 7C3 outperformed 7C2. Second,
   splenic endothelial cells were targeted efficiently (Fig. 4B). Notably,
   relative to splenic endothelial cells, very few immune cells and
   hepatocytes were tdTomato^+ (SI Appendix, Fig. S3 T and U). Given this
   degree of specificity has not been reported to date, we repeated the
   experiment using 34 Ai14 mice over the course of several months. The
   7C3 delivered Cre mRNA to splenic endothelial cells in every experiment
   (Fig. 4C). However, we did observe batch-to-batch variability with
   respect to hepatocyte targeting (Fig. 4 C and D). In 22 of the 34 mice,
   a low percentage of hepatocytes were tdTomato^+ (<13%); in 12 of the 34
   mice, we observed high percentages of tdTomato^+ cells. Averaging data
   from all 34 mice, the number of tdTomato^+ splenic endothelial cells
   (43%) was 2.2 times higher than the number of tdTomato^+ hepatocytes
   (20%) (Fig. 4D). Splenic endothelial cell delivery was also
   dose-dependent (SI Appendix, Fig. S3V). The variable delivery to
   hepatocytes was unlikely to be driven by toxicity; throughout our
   studies, we injected 34 mice with 7C3 and did not observe changes in
   mouse weight or obvious signs of toxicity (SI Appendix, Fig. S3W). We
   were unable to identify the source of batch variability; however, we
   hypothesize it is driven by the polymeric backbone of 7C3 and the
   resulting heterogenous chemical structure. Our data strongly suggest
   that future FIND screens should focus on compounds with defined
   chemical structures, which may be less likely to exhibit biological
   heterogeneity. The data also demonstrate that 7C3 can efficiently
   deliver mRNA to splenic endothelial cells in vivo. Importantly, the 7C2
   and 7C3 formulations both included the lipomer 7C1 but had variable
   molar compositions of helper lipids (18:1 Lyso PC and DOPE), which
   distinguished them chemically from previously described
   endothelial-targeting nanoparticles. The differences in delivery
   between 7C2 and 7C3 provide interesting preliminary evidence that
   suggests changing the composition of helper lipids added to a given
   ionizable amine can alter tropism. The compositions and efficacy of 7C2
   and 7C3 are included in SI Appendix, Fig. S4.

   (A) The top two particles, 7C2 and 7C3, are characterized by delivery

   eight experiments of tdTomato+ splenic endothelial cells and
   hepatocytes in LSL-Tom mice following a single 1.5-mg/kg injection of
   Cre mRNA delivered by 7C3. n = 34. ****P < 0.0001, two-tailed t test.
   (E) Indel percentage in splenic ECs following two injections of 7C3
   carrying Cas9 mRNA and e-sgICAM2 at a mass ratio of 1:1, 3:1, and 5:1.
   (F) Indel percentage in hepatocytes following two injections of 7C3
   carrying Cas9 mRNA and e-sgICAM2 at a mass ratio of 1:1, 3:1, and 5:1.

   Given the difference between small and large RNA delivery, we
   quantified how LNPs codelivered CRISPR-Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA. We
   formulated Cas9 mRNA and two guides targeting ICAM-2 into LNPs at a 3:1
   mass ratio and injected a 2.0 mg/kg total i.v. on day 0 and 2. On day
   7, we isolated endothelial cells from the spleen, lung, kidney, and
   liver, as well as hepatocytes (SI Appendix, Fig. S5A). Splenic
   endothelial cell editing mediated by 7C3 was more robust than editing
   in hepatocytes (SI Appendix, Fig. S5B). Mice injected with 7C2 and 7C3
   did not lose weight, compared with PBS-treated mice (SI Appendix, Fig.
   S5C). These studies were also conducted with sgRNAs that were
   chemically modified at the 5′ and 3′ termini (38); during the course of
   the experiments, two groups demonstrated that heavily modified sgRNAs
   improved in vivo editing (7, 8). We redesigned sgICAM2b with “enhanced”
   modifications (8) (referred to as e-sgICAM2) (SI Appendix, Fig. S5D)
   and formulated 7C3 to carry Cas9 mRNA and e-sgICAM2. Given that
   e-sgICAM2 was more likely to resist degradation in vivo (8), we
   hypothesized that the optimal mass ratio of Cas9 mRNA:sgRNA would
   decrease from 3:1, which is the optimized ratio with minimally
   stablized sgRNAs. To test this, we formulated 7C3 with Cas9
   mRNA:e-sgRNA ratios of 5:1, 3:1, and 1:1, keeping the total injected
   dose constant at 2.0 mg/kg. After injecting mice i.v. with 2.0 mg/kg
   total RNA (Cas9 mRNA + sgRNA) on days 0 and 2, we isolated splenic
   endothelial cells and hepatocytes using FACS on day 7. We observed gene
   editing in splenic endothelial cells and hepatocytes at all
   mRNA-to-sgRNA ratios, with an average of 20% editing in the 1:1 mass
   ratio group (Fig. 4 E and F). As expected, the lower Cas9 mRNA:e-sgRNA
   mass ratio led to increased editing. Once again, mice injected with 7C3
   did not lose weight compared with PBS-treated controls (SI Appendix,
   Fig. S5E). This is a demonstration of systemic Cas9-mediated editing of
   endothelial cells in wild-type mice. These data demonstrate that
   systemically administered nanoparticles can edit endothelial cells, and
   that the ideal Cas9:sgRNA ratio will depend on the relative stability
   of the two molecules.

Discussion

   FIND is a high-throughput method to quantify functional mRNA delivery
   mediated by LNPs. The distinction between biodistribution and
   functional delivery is significant; >96% of delivered RNA does not
   escape the endosome (23, 24), and endosomal escape may vary with cell
   type or disease state (41), making it hard to predict functional
   delivery using biodistribution. Notably, Cre mRNA must be translated in
   the cytoplasm, translocate into the nucleus, and edit target DNA. The
   similarity between these steps and the steps required for
   nuclease-mediated gene editing is one reason we selected a Cre-based
   FIND system. We also chose the Cre-lox system because Ai14 mice are
   well-validated and commonly available (27). Moreover, the Cre-mediated
   signal is strong and does not vary dramatically with time; by contrast,
   a GFP-based system would have a signal that varies hour by hour, making
   FACS gates impossible to interpret during a long experimental day.

   Although we focused on endothelial cells, FIND is agnostic to cell
   type; we envision FIND studies that identify LNPs targeting other
   cells. Ai14 mice have recently been used to monitor LNP-mediated
   delivery to immune populations at a cellular resolution (42). Given
   that on- and off-target cells can be isolated from the same mouse, FIND
   may also be used to identify (or iteratively evolve) LNPs with high
   therapeutic windows. To further increase the ratio of splenic
   endothelial cell:hepatocyte delivery, we could incorporate
   endothelial-cell-targeting ligands (43, 44).

   More generally, this ability to study how hundreds of LNPs target
   combinations of cells in vivo may elucidate relationships between LNP
   structure and in vivo functional delivery. In this case, FIND enabled
   us to quickly identify two lead LNPs. Here we delivered sgRNAs
   targeting the inflammation-related gene ICAM-2. However, the long-term
   utility of FIND will be defined by its ability to identify
   nanoparticles for in vivo gene editing more efficiently than the
   current gold standard, which is in vitro screening. Relatedly, to fully
   utilize the large in vivo datasets generated by FIND, efforts will need
   to be made to develop high-throughput ways of characterizing LNP
   characterizations zeta-potential, pK[a], and lipid bilayer structure.
   We believe that, in time, these advances will help position FIND to
   help facilitate the discovery of structure–activity relationships to
   nonliver tissues. In future studies, it will also be important to
   further improve the efficiency of gene editing in endothelial cells
   beyond 20%.

   We did not observe noticeable experimental variability within a given
   FIND screening experiment. We quantified the consistency of the
   sequencing readouts by analyzing the normalized DNA delivery values
   between bioreplicates. In all cell types, in each of the three screens,
   there were no overt differences between bioreplicates, suggesting the
   precision of the sequencing was high (SI Appendix, Fig. S6). In
   individual LNP testing, we did observe variability in hepatocyte
   delivery when 7C3 was administered over several batches to a total of
   34 mice. Notably, delivery to splenic ECs was consistent, as was the
   (lack of) delivery to all other tested cell types. We were unable to
   identify the chemical variations that led to batch variability in
   hepatocyte targeting. Two possibilities that will require further
   investigation include variable LNP chemical structure and variable mRNA
   activity. Performing FIND screens with well-defined compounds could
   minimize batch-to-batch variability.

   We note that when testing many new LNPs batch variability may be
   observed since the formulations are not yet optimized. However, this
   issue is not related to FIND or to pooled LNP screens; it is just as
   likely to occur when LNPs are tested individually. We believe FIND may
   actually minimize unwanted error in two ways. First, Cre-based
   reporters quantify delivery at the level of cell type. Identifying the
   cell type with batch issues is much easier than with two common
   approaches used in the field today: mRNA encoding luciferase or
   erythropoietin, which quantifies protein production at the tissue- and
   organism-level, respectively. Second, when nanoparticles are screened
   individually, missed injections, small changes in time points, mouse
   age, and other variables can introduce “silent” experimental
   variability that affects how LNP1 performs, relative to LNP2. Here, we
   inject all of the nanoparticles into the same mouse, which helps to
   reduce these sources of unintentional experimental variance. At the
   same time, FIND has several important limitations. LNPs must be stable
   and must be well-tolerated. Like all DNA-based screens, it is
   imperative to prevent DNA contamination.

   Finally, we note that the doses of mRNA or gene editing constructs that
   are well-tolerated after systemic administration to patients has not
   yet been established. In one related example, the FDA approved ONPATTRO
   therapeutic, which is an siRNA systemically administered in an LNP, at
   a dose of 0.3 mg/kg. This may provide an initial estimate of the mRNA
   doses that are tolerated in the clinic. However, Cas9 mRNA is >100
   times larger than a single siRNA duplex (∼4,500-nt ssRNA vs. 21-nt
   dsRNA). As a result, there is still a need to further improve the
   potency of the drug delivery systems as well as the mRNA drugs to
   advance novel Cas9 therapies into the clinic. Despite these caveats,
   FIND is a robust method to quantify how hundreds of LNPs deliver mRNA
   to any combination of cell types in vivo. We believe FIND is
   well-positioned to help identify LNPs with novel tropisms, which could
   lead to improved nonliver RNA drugs.

Materials and Methods

Nanoparticle Formulation.

   Nanoparticles were formulated using a microfluidic device as previously
   described (26). Briefly, nucleic acids (mRNA, DNA barcodes, siRNA, and
   sgRNA) were diluted in 10 mM citrate buffer (Teknova) while lipid-amine
   compounds, alkyl-tailed PEG, cholesterol, and helper lipids were
   diluted in ethanol. For nanoparticle screens, Cre mRNA and DNA barcodes
   were mixed at a 10:1 mass ratio. Citrate and ethanol phases were
   combined in a microfluidic device by syringes (Hamilton Company) at a
   flow rate of 600 µL/min and 200 µL/min, respectively. All PEGs,
   cholesterol, and helper lipids were purchased from Avanti Lipids.

DNA Barcoding.

   Each chemically distinct LNP was formulated to carry its own unique DNA
   barcode (Fig. 1). For example, LNP1 carried DNA barcode 1, while the
   chemically distinct LNP2 carried DNA barcode 2. DNA barcodes were
   designed rationally with several characteristics, as we previously
   described (20). Fifty-six- nucleotide-long ssDNA sequences were
   purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. The two nucleotides on the
   5′ and 3′ ends of the 56-nt ssDNA were modified with phosphorothioates
   to reduce exonuclease degradation and improve DNA barcode stability. To
   ensure equal amplification of each sequence, we included universal
   forward and reverse primer regions on all barcodes. To monitor for PCR
   bias, each barcode was also designed with seven random nucleotides.
   Each barcode was distinguished using a unique 8-bp sequence. An 8-bp
   sequence can generate over 4^8 (65,536) distinct barcodes. We used 240
   distinct 8-bp sequences designed by to prevent sequence bleaching on
   the Illumina MiniSeq sequencing machine.

Nanoparticle Characterization.

   LNP hydrodynamic diameter was measured using high-throughput DLS
   (DynaPro Plate Reader II; Wyatt). LNPs were diluted in sterile 1× PBS
   to a concentration of ∼0.06 μg/mL and analyzed. To avoid using unstable
   LNPs, and to enable sterile purification using a 0.22-μm filter, LNPs
   were included only if they met three criteria: diameter >20 nm,
   diameter <200 nm, and correlation function with one inflection point.
   Particles that met these criteria were dialyzed with 1× PBS
   (Invitrogen) and were sterile-filtered with a 0.22-μm filter.

Cell Culture.

   In vitro experiments were performed using HEK.293 cells (GenTarget)
   stably transduced with a CMV-lox-GFP-stop-lox-RFP construct cultured in
   DMEM/F-12 50/50 media (Corning) supplemented by 10% (vol/vol) FBS (VWR)
   and 1% (vol/vol) penicillin–streptomycin (VWR). Cells were seeded in a
   six-well plate at a density of 300,000 cells per well; 24 h later, LNPs
   were added with a total mRNA dose of 100 ng. Six hours after
   transfection, media was refreshed. DNA was isolated using 50 μL of
   QuickExtract (EpiCentre).

Endocytosis Inhibition.

   For experiments shown in Fig. 1 and SI Appendix, Fig. S3 E–H, cells
   were incubated with endocytosis inhibitors. Specifically, 1 h before
   incubation with pooled LNPs, inhibitors of clathrin-mediated
   endocytosis (chlorpromazine, 100 μM; Alfa Aesar), caveolae-mediated
   endocytosis (genistein, 100μM; TCI America), and macropinocytosis
   [5-(N-Ethyl-N-isopropyl) Amiloride, EIPA, 50 μM; Toronto Research
   Chemicals] were added to cells.

Animal Experiments.

   All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the Georgia
   Institute of Technology’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
   LSL-Tomato (007914), C57BL/6J (000664), and constitutive SpCas9
   (026179) mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory and used
   between 5–12 wk of age. In all experiments, we used n = 3–5 mice per
   group. Mice were injected i.v. via the lateral tail vein or
   intramuscularly into the quadriceps, tibialis anterior, and
   gastrocnemius. The nanoparticle concentration was determined using
   NanoDrop (Thermo Scientific). For in vivo nanoparticle screens, mice
   were administered 1.5 mg/kg for intravascular and 1 mg/kg for
   intramuscular administration. The dosing schedule for each experiment
   is shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S7.

Cell Isolation and Staining.

   Cells were isolated 72 h after injection with LNPs unless otherwise
   noted. Mice were perfused with 20 mL of 1× PBS through the right
   atrium. Tissues were finely cut and then placed in a digestive enzyme
   solution with collagenase type I (Sigma-Aldrich), collagenase XI
   (Sigma-Aldrich), and hyaluronidase (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37 °C at 550 rpm
   for 45 min. The digestive enzyme for heart and spleen included
   collagenase IV (32, 37, 45). Cell suspension was filtered through 70-μm
   mesh and red blood cells were lysed. Cells were stained to identify
   specific cell populations and sorted using the BD FacsFusion and BD
   Facs Aria IIIu cell sorters in the Georgia Institute of Technology
   Cellular Analysis Core. For in vitro experiments, BD Accuri C6 and BD
   FacsFusion were used. The antibody clones used were anti-CD31 (390;
   BioLegend), anti-CD45.2 (104; BioLegend), and anti-CD102 (3C4;
   BioLegend). PE anti-mCD47 (miap301; BioLegend) was used for tdTomato
   compensation. Representative flow gates are located in SI Appendix,
   Fig. S8. PBS-injected Ai14 mice were used to gate tdTomato populations
   for i.v. administration, while contralateral limbs were used to gate
   for intramuscular experiments.

Biodistribution.

   LNPs encapsulating Cy5.5-tagged DNA barcode were administered at 0.75
   mg/kg. After 3 h, tissues were isolated without perfusion, weighed
   individually, and imaged using the Licor Odyssey CLx imaging system.
   Signal intensity was normalized to tissue weight.

Endothelial RNA interference.

   C57BL/6J mice were injected with 7C2 and 7C3 with PBS, 2 mg/kg siCTRL
   (siGFP-647) (AxoLabs), or 1 mg/kg siICAM2 (AxoLabs). In all cases,
   siRNAs were chemically modified at the 2′ position to increase
   stability and negate immunostimulation. Both siGFP and siICAM2
   sequences have been previously reported several times (32, 37, 45).
   Seventy-two hours after injection, tissues were isolated and protein
   expression was determined via flow cytometry. ICAM2 MFI in PBS-treated
   mice was normalized to 100%, and all treated groups were compared with
   this control group.

Endothelial Gene Editing.

   Mice constitutively expressing SpCas9 were injected three times with
   7C2 or 7C3 carrying 1.5 mg/kg of two chemically modified sgRNAs with
   thee nucleotides modified on the 5′ and 5′ ends (TriLink
   Biotechnologies) targeting ICAM2 (sgICAM2ab) (1:1 mass ratio).
   Separately, C57BL/6J mice were injected two times with 2 mg/kg with 7C2
   and 7C3 formulated to carry both SpCas9 mRNA (L-7206; Trilink
   Biotechnology) and sgICAM2ab at a 3:1 mass ratio. Five days after the
   last injection, tissues were isolated, and ICAM2 protein expression was
   measured concurrently while ∼20,000 cells were sorted into
   QuickExtract. Next, C57BL/6J mice were injected two times with 2 mg/kg
   with 7C3 formulated to carry both SpCas9 mRNA (L-7206; Trilink
   Biotechnology) and e-sgICAM2 (AxoLabs) at a 1:1, 3:1, and 5:1 mass
   ratio. Five days after the last injection, tissues were isolated, and
   ICAM2 protein expression was measured concurrently while ∼20,000 cells
   were sorted into QuickExtract. Indel formation was measured by TIDE
   (https://www.deskgen.com/landing/tide.html).

Tissue Immunostaining.

   Excised organs were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron
   Microscopy Systems) in PBS. Tissues were washed twice in PBS and
   cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in PBS until the organs sank to the bottom
   of the container. Organs were then embedded in optimal cutting
   temperature compound (Tissue-Tek) and cryosectioned (10 μm) onto
   slides. Antigen retrieval was performed on slides for 10 min in a
   pressure cooker using low-pH antigen-retrieval solution (Life
   Technologies). Sections were then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100
   (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 10 min at room temperature (RT) before being
   blocked for nonspecific binding with 5% donkey serum (Sigma-Aldrich) in
   PBS for 1 h at RT. Sections were incubated with anti-VE cadherin (BV13;
   Biolegend), diluted to 0.5 μg/mL in PBS, overnight at 4 °C. After three
   washes with PBS, sections were incubated at RT with Alexa Flour 647
   conjugated donkey anti-rat (Thermo Fisher) diluted in PBS for 2 h.
   After two PBS washes, nuclei were stained with DAPI (Life
   Technologies), and coverslips were mounted using Prolong Gold (Life
   Technologies).

   Images were acquired with a Hamamatsu Flash 4.0 v2 sCMOS camera on a
   PerkinElmer UltraView spinning disk confocal microscope mounted to a
   Zeiss Axiovert 200M body. Single-cell images were acquired using
   Volocity (PerkinElmer) with Z-stacks taken in 0.2-μm increments with a
   63× N.A. 1.4 plan-apochromat objective. Stitched images were acquired
   using a 20× N.A. 0.8 objective with an automated XY stage (ASI)
   controlled by Volocity and set to 20% overlap. All images were linearly
   contrast enhanced.

PCR Amplification.

   All samples were amplified and prepared for sequencing using a one-step
   PCR protocol as previously described (20). More specifically, 1 μL of
   primers (5 μM for final reverse/forward, 0.5 μM for base forward) were
   added to 5 μL of Kapa HiFi 2× master mix, and 4 μL template DNA/water.
   The reaction was run for 30 cycles. When the PCR did not produce clear
   bands, the primer concentrations, DNA template input, PCR temperature,
   and number of cycles were optimized for individual samples.

Deep Sequencing.

   Illumina deep sequencing was conducted in Georgia Institute of
   Technology’s Molecular Evolution core. Runs were performed on an
   Illumina Miniseq. Primers were designed based on Nextera XT adapter
   sequences.

Data Normalization.

   Counts for each particle, per tissue, were normalized to the barcoded
   LNP mixture we injected into the mouse. This “input” DNA provided the
   DNA counts and was used to normalize DNA counts from the cells and
   tissues.

Data Analysis and Statistics.

   Sequencing results were processed using a custom Python-based tool to
   extract raw barcode counts for each tissue. These raw counts were then
   normalized with an R script prior for further analysis. Statistical
   analysis was done using GraphPad Prism 7; more specifically, one-tailed
   t test or one-way ANOVAs were used where appropriate. Data are plotted
   as mean ± SEM unless otherwise stated.

Significance

   Jawless, boneless, and virtually without fossil record, hagfish have
   long escaped systematists’ grip on their place among other fish. Yet
   their systematic resolution is critical to define vertebrates as a
   clade. Here we report an unequivocal fossil hagfish from the Cretaceous
   Mediterranean. Using this fossil to calibrate the evolutionary history
   of the group, our analysis supports hagfish and lampreys as sister
   groups, which likely diverged from one another in early Paleozoic
   times. As a result, vertebrates have a deep dichotomy, where some
   fossil jawless vertebrates sit closer to hagfish and lampreys than to
   jawed vertebrates. We showed that morphology-based analysis converged
   onto molecular inferences when characters are coded nonindependently,
   providing a case study for morphological–molecular conflicts in animal
   phylogeny.

Abstract

   Hagfish depart so much from other fishes anatomically that they were
   sometimes considered not fully vertebrate. They may represent: (i) an
   anatomically primitive outgroup of vertebrates (the morphology-based
   craniate hypothesis); or (ii) an anatomically degenerate vertebrate
   lineage sister to lampreys (the molecular-based cyclostome hypothesis).
   This systematic conundrum has become a prominent case of conflict
   between morphology- and molecular-based phylogenies. To date, the
   fossil record has offered few insights to this long-branch problem or
   the evolutionary history of hagfish in general, because unequivocal
   fossil members of the group are unknown. Here, we report an unequivocal
   fossil hagfish from the early Late Cretaceous of Lebanon. The soft
   tissue anatomy includes key attributes of living hagfish: cartilages of
   barbels, postcranial position of branchial apparatus, and chemical
   traces of slime glands. This indicates that the suite of characters
   unique to living hagfish appeared well before Cretaceous times. This
   new hagfish prompted a reevaluation of morphological characters for
   interrelationships among jawless vertebrates. By addressing
   nonindependence of characters, our phylogenetic analyses recovered
   hagfish and lampreys in a clade of cyclostomes (congruent with the
   cyclostome hypothesis) using only morphological data. This new
   phylogeny places the fossil taxon within the hagfish crown group, and
   resolved other putative fossil cyclostomes to the stem of either
   hagfish or lamprey crown groups. These results potentially resolve the
   morphological–molecular conflict at the base of the Vertebrata. Thus,
   assessment of character nonindependence may help reconcile
   morphological and molecular inferences for other major discords in
   animal phylogeny.

   Hagfish and lampreys (cyclostomes) represent the only living lineages
   of jawless vertebrates (or agnathans) (1). Cyclostomes are generally
   considered primitive morphologically with respect to jawed vertebrates
   (gnathostomes) (1, 2). However, consensus is still lacking about
   cyclostome relationships. None of the traits proposed to unite hagfish
   and lampreys sets them apart clearly from extinct lineages of jawless
   vertebrates (3, 4). Furthermore, characters distribute asymmetrically.
   Hagfish have fewer traits than lampreys in common with gnathostomes,
   and are characterized by rudimentary state or absence of otherwise
   pan-vertebrate traits such as electroreceptors or taste buds (5, 6).
   Thus, resolving the cyclostome relationships holds direct implications
   for defining the vertebrate crown group, and for describing early
   character evolution in that clade. Motivated by this prospect, a number
   of analyses have set out to clarify positions of hagfish and lampreys
   with respect to gnathostomes.

   The endeavor has generated variants of four main topological schemes
   (Fig. 1 A–D). Early classifications split vertebrates between agnathans
   and gnathostomes, with cyclostomes nested within the former (Fig. 1A)
   (7). With the advent of cladistics, this dichotomy was challenged:
   hagfish fell outside the vertebrate node, rendering cyclostomes
   paraphyletic (craniate hypothesis; Fig. 1B) (8). More recent analyses
   of morphological data continue to support the paraphyly, but differ
   from the earlier analyses in placing fossil agnathans on the
   gnathostome stem (Fig. 1D) (9⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓–16). Meanwhile, cyclostome
   paraphyly has been contested by molecular phylogenetics, which nearly
   unanimously favor cyclostomes as a clade (cyclostome hypothesis; Fig.
   1C) (17, 18). Thus, the controversy has been locked in a stalemate
   between the molecular inferences for cyclostome monophyly (Fig. 1C) and
   the morphologically supported cyclostome paraphyly (Fig. 1D).

   A summary of hypotheses for cyclostome relationships. The hypotheses
   differ in cyclostome monophyly or paraphyly (columns), and about
   relationships of fossil “agnathans” with respect to the cyclostome and
   gnathostome crowns (rows). Blue box = support from morphological data;
   red box = support from molecular data. Yellow box = compatible with
   both data types. (A) Noncladistic classification schemes based on
   morphological data with cyclostomes nested among agnathans. (B)
   Craniate hypothesis in early cladistic analyses based on morphological
   data, where hagfish and fossil agnathans become nested outside the
   crown vertebrate node. (C) Cyclostome hypothesis as supported by
   molecular data. Fossil agnathans are assumed on the gnathostome stem.
   (D) Craniate hypothesis in recent analyses of morphological data, where
   hagfish remain nested outside the crown vertebrate node. Fossil
   agnathans are placed on the gnathostome stem. (E) Updated cyclostome
   hypothesis supported by the analyses of morphological data presented in
   this paper. Hagfish and lampreys form a clade of cyclostomes as
   supported by the molecular inferences. However, some fossil agnathans
   are closer to the cyclostome crown than to the gnathostome crown.

   Despite the ever more complete molecular datasets, consensus has not
   been achieved. This is because (i) monophyly is an anticipated outcome
   of long-branch attraction in molecular data; and (ii) fossil taxa that
   potentially break up the long branches are only accessible via
   morphological data. Interpretations of character polarities are
   radically different between the two topologies. The
   morphology-supported paraphyly implies rudimentary state or absence of
   traits in hagfish as primitive (8). For the monophyly, molecular trees
   are agnostic about character polarities, but the rudiments and absence
   in hagfish tend to be interpreted as secondary (2, 3). An equally
   parsimonious alternative— hagfish as primitive and lampreys and
   gnathostomes as convergent—is rarely discussed (2). As such, cyclostome
   relationships provide a classic example of long-branch problems
   hindering morphological–molecular congruence.

   Although fossils are critical in reducing branch lengths, the patchy
   fossil record of cyclostomes remains a formidable challenge. For
   hagfish (myxinoids), three soft-bodied Carboniferous forms
   (Gilpichthys, Myxineidus, and Myxinikela) have each been posited as a
   stem myxinoid (19⇓–21), but myxinoid affinities for the former two have
   been questioned (9, 22, 23). Myxinikela is the sole putative myxinoid
   with any degree of cladistic support (9), but its similarities to
   living hagfish may partly be artifacts of preservation (23). As these
   Carboniferous forms are only preserved with a handful of morphological
   structures, the inferences have been based on a few myxinoid- or
   cyclostome-diagnostic characters (potential keratinous teeth in
   Gilpichthys; a longitudinally elongate nasohypophyseal system in
   Myxinikela) and the general absence of lamprey-like traits (e.g., oral
   funnel, discrete dorsal fins) (19⇓–21). Consequently, living hagfishes
   imply long ghost lineages, making it difficult to interpret the
   peculiar morphology of the group. Here, we report an unequivocal
   hagfish fossil from the Late Cretaceous of Lebanon—which reduces this
   gap in the fossil record by 100 My—and present an updated
   morphology-based phylogeny of cyclostomes. We also describe the
   exquisitely preserved soft-tissue anatomy of this new hagfish using
   trace elements mapped by synchrotron rapid-scanning X-ray fluorescence
   (SRS-XRF; described in Methods and SI Appendix, Part B).

Etymology.

   The generic name is derived from “Tethys” after the Tethys Sea and
   “myxinos” (Latinized Greek for “slimy fish”). The specific name is
   derived from “tapirus” (Latinized Old Tupi for tapir) and “rostrum” (a
   Latin root for snout) for the elongated tapering snout.

Horizon and Locality.

   The type specimen was collected from sublithographic limestones of
   Hâdjula Lagerstätte (Cenomanian, Upper Cretaceous), 10 km east of
   Byblos, Lebanon. The locality is interpreted as an interreef basin on a
   carbonate platform (24). See SI Appendix, Part A for detailed
   information on provenance and geological settings.

Diagnosis.

   Tethymyxine tapirostrum is a myxinoid exhibiting the following unique
   combination of characters: tapering nasohypophyseal profile; tentacular
   cartilage not extending beyond nasohypophyseal aperture; prebranchial
   length nearly equal to branchial length; 8 pairs of branchial pouches;
   133 slime glands on one side; and caudal fin not expanded into a round
   lobe.

Description and Comparisons.

   In visible light, BHI 6445 (Fig. 2) is preserved in full-body outline
   with soft tissues (body length = 313 mm). The trunk lies on its left
   side, whereas the head was twisted counterclockwise to expose the
   ventral side. The preserved tissues are marked by greater abundance of
   P, Mn, Fe, Cu, and Zn relative to the surrounding matrix (Fig. 2C and
   SI Appendix, Fig. S3). These tissues are inferred to be (i) composed of
   collagenous extracellular matrix (e.g., chondrocranium); (ii) enclosed
   by a highly vascularized epithelial sheet (e.g., branchial pouches,
   livers); or (iii) secreted keratin (e.g., infillings of slime glands,
   tooth-like apparatus). The original outline of the body is clearly
   demarcated from the matrix in most elements mapped by SRS-XRF (Fig. 2C
   and SI Appendix, Fig. S3). Al, P, S, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, and As are
   markedly more abundant in the preserved tissues than in the matrix,
   whereas the reverse is true for Si, Ca, and Hg. The preservation of
   structures and imprints is partly obscured by glue and paint, but the
   fossilized tissues can be distinguished from artifacts. Optically, the
   structural preservation is distinguished by surface topography under
   the artifacts. In SRS-XRF, the artifacts are clearly differentiated
   from the fossil and matrix based on distributions of S, Ti, V, and Fe.
   In particular, X-ray absorption spectroscopy reveals differential
   distributions of sulfur species in this specimen (SI Appendix, Fig.
   S4). Sulfate is the dominant species in all residues; organic sulfur is
   present in both the fossil and matrix, but virtually absent in the glue
   (SI Appendix, Part B). This result highlights the utility of SRS-XRF in
   identifying curatorial artifacts in fossil specimens.

   The preservation of decay-prone soft tissues such as branchial pouches
   and slime (Fig. 2) suggests that BHI 6445 was rapidly buried (25).
   Although the mode of preservation is similar to that of the Early
   Cretaceous freshwater lamprey Mesomyzon from the Jehol Group of China,
   internal structures of BHI 6445 are not obscured by the preserved
   integument and muscles as in specimens of Mesomyzon (26) (for detailed
   discussion, see SI Appendix, Part A).

   The overall characteristics clearly reject nonmyxinoid hypotheses for
   the identity of BHI 6445. The absence of a mineralized skeleton, paired
   fins, and jaws rules out anguilliform gnathostomes like the coeval eel
   Luenchelys (27). BHI 6445 is not a lamprey either, because it does not
   have an oral sucker, tectal cartilages, branchial basket, dorsal fins,
   and other skeletal and proportional features of lampreys that would
   have been present given the state of preservation (25). Instead, BHI
   6445 has characters diagnostic of myxinoids, including an elongate
   nasohypophyseal portion of the chondrocranium, posteriorly placed
   branchial pouches, and slime glands.

   Tethymyxine has a small head relative to its body size. The
   prebranchial length of BHI 6445 is shorter than that in living
   hagfishes, relative to the total body length (13% versus 20–30%) (28).
   As a consequence, the first branchial pouch sits more anteriorly than
   in living hagfish species, leaving a relatively short space for the
   lingual apparatus to occupy. The snout tapers toward the
   nasohypophyseal aperture (nostril). The nasohypophyseal barbels are
   preserved with the sigmoidal tentacular cartilage on the left side of
   BHI 6445. The barbels sit behind the aperture as in living Rubicundus
   (29) (Fig. 3 B and C), but the specimen differs from it in lacking a
   protruded nasohypophyseal tube. The tentacular cartilage is fused
   posteriorly with the lateral element of the anterior lingual
   cartilages. Both the left and right parts of the keratinous tooth
   plates are preserved in association with the anterior lingual
   cartilages. Although several cusps can be identified by the
   distributions of Ca, Mn, Fe, Ni, and Hg (SI Appendix, Fig. S3), precise
   cusp number and shape cannot be determined. Unlike the preservation of
   comb-like tooth plates in Gilpichthys from Mazon Creek (20), the plates
   may have been pyrolysated in BHI 6445 as seen in the scales of
   actinopterygians from the same locality (27). Presumably the missing
   counterpart of BHI 6445 has the rest of preserved chondrocranial
   elements.

   A time-scaled phylogenetic tree of cyclostomes. (A) Summary tree
   showing cyclostome relationships. Maximum parsimony and Bayesian
   inferences converged onto each other in placing Tethymyxine within the
   hagfish crown group and supporting cyclostome monophyly. The precise
   topology is from the maximum parsimony analysis (SI Appendix, Fig. S6).
   Node ages represent median of 95% HPD distribution in a Bayesian
   molecular clock analysis of mitogenomic sequences (16S and COI) under
   fossilized birth–death model (see SI Appendix, Fig. S9 for a fully
   calibrated maximum clade credibility tree with node intervals). The
   crown group of cyclostomes is united by at least two morphological
   characters (shown on each stem): keratinous tooth plates (yellow) and
   periocular position of trunk muscles (red). At Top Right, the
   nasohypophyseal profiles are compared in ventral view among three
   selected crown-group hagfishes (B: Tethymyxine tapirostrum; C,
   Rubicundus eos; D, Eptatretus stoutii; the latter two based on ref.
   29). To show morphological divergence among the three major crown
   groups of living vertebrates (E, myxinoids; F, petromyzontiforms; G,
   gnathostomes), each is accompanied by a chondrocranium in left lateral
   view (green: neural crest-derived nasohypophyseal skeleton; red:
   mesodermally derived neurocranium; blue: neural crest-derived
   pharyngeal skeleton). Filled squares represent occurrences of the
   terminal taxa. Crown nodes are each indicated by a filled circle, and
   total nodes by an empty circle. Abbreviations: nha, nasohypophyseal
   aperture; nhb, nasohypophyseal barbels; mo, mouth; ob, oral barbels.

   Tethymyxine has eight pairs of branchial pouches. This number is
   greater than in Rubicundus spp. (n = 5) and most other living hagfishes
   (n = 4∼7), equal to some species of Eptatretus and Nemamyxyne, and
   smaller than in some species of Eptatretus (n = 14 in E. polytrema)
   (28). A structure immediately behind the branchial series is
   topographically and morphologically consistent with a heart, which has
   Fe in higher abundance than in the surrounding tissues (Fig. 2 D and
   E). The intestine extends between the anterior and posterior liver
   lobes. These visceral tissues have different textures and colors that
   allow clear delineation under natural light (SI Appendix, Fig. S2).
   However, the element mapping by SRS-XRF shows similar compositions
   among these tissues. P, S, and Cl appear to have greater abundances in
   the branchial pouches than in the intestine, and Ca seems to be the
   reverse (SI Appendix, Fig. S3).

   A characteristic unique to hagfish, slime glands are preserved in an
   uninterrupted series of infillings that extends nearly the entire
   length of the body on the ventral side. The infillings are
   distinguished from other tissues by surface profile, high Ca, P, and S
   abundances, and higher levels of Cl, Ti, Mn, Fe, Cu, Ni, Zn, and Hg
   relative to the matrix (Fig. 2 and SI Appendix, Figs. S2 and S3 and
   Table S1). The chemical mapping is consistent with the fact that a
   major component of hagfish slime is tightly coiled, mucin-coated
   α-keratin threads (30)—pyrolysates of which are characterized by
   calcium phosphatic content (31). The number of the slime glands (n =
   133 on the right) is greater than in most living hagfishes (n =
   70∼110), but close to that of R. eos (n = 128∼130) (28). The end of the
   tail is obscured by paint, but it is possible to outline the body by
   relatively high concentrations of Cu, P, S, and Fe (contained in paint,
   but higher in preserved tissues) and relatively low concentrations of
   Ca (Fig. 2C and SI Appendix, Figs. S3 and S4 and Table S1). The
   notochord is difficult to identify optically (as it is generally in
   fossils of soft-bodied vertebrates), but can be delineated with the
   high P and S concentrations along the dorsal midline (SI Appendix,
   Figs. S3 and S4 B and C). The tail tapers rather than expanding into a
   round lobe.

Phylogenetics.

   We generated a morphological dataset to test the relationships of
   Tethymyxine and cyclostomes. Tethymyxine has myxinoid apomorphies not
   identified in other fossil taxa. These traits include the posteriorly
   placed branchial series and slime glands, which are absent, missing, or
   ambiguous in Myxinikela and other putative fossil cyclostomes (9). To
   code these unequivocal and potential myxinoids in a phylogenetic
   dataset, we reevaluated morphological characters that are
   nonindependent, and enhanced contingency coding to reduce implicit
   weighting (32). For example, attributes of a mineralized skeleton such
   as bones and scales are not simply absent in the soft-bodied myxinoids.
   Those characters are inapplicable in this lineage. Applying no
   character values to attributes of biomineralization in myxinoids
   removes additive weight of lacking mineralization in every coded
   skeletal element. This contingency coding eliminated, on average, 70%
   of character information from nonvertebrate outgroups and 32% from
   cyclostomes, which would otherwise be available to coding (SI Appendix,
   Parts B–D and Fig. S5 for comparative analysis).

   Searches of this dataset, using both maximum parsimony and Bayesian
   methods, resolved Tethymyxine within the myxinoid crown group, sister
   to species of the living genus Rubicundus (Fig. 3A and SI Appendix,
   Figs. S6–S8). These two genera with an elongate snout, indented
   barbels, and a large number of slime glands (>100) (Fig. 3 B and C)
   were nested outside the clade of more conventional living myxinoids
   (Eptatretus, Myxine, and Neomyxine) (Fig. 3D). Myxinikela was resolved
   as a stem myxinoid, whereas other Carboniferous forms (Gilpichthys,
   Hardistiella, Mayomyzon, and Myxineidus) and Priscomyzon were found
   along the stem of lampreys. Under maximum parsimony, the crown group of
   cyclostomes is united by two unambiguous character changes: keratinous
   tooth plates and migration of postotic myomeres to position of eyes
   (Fig. 3A and SI Appendix, Table S3). Euconodonts, Pipiscius, and
   anaspids fell into the cyclostome stem. Together, these lineages
   comprised the total group of cyclostomes. Controversial Cambrian forms
   (Haikouella, Haikouichthys, Metaspriggina, and Myllokunmingia) were
   resolved in the vertebrate stem.

   Given the topology obtained in the maximum parsimony analysis, and
   using the fossil-calibrated dataset of mitogenomic sequences, tip-dated
   Bayesian estimates of divergence placed the crown cyclostome node from
   the earliest Cambrian (Terreneuvian) to Early Silurian (Wenlockian)
   times [95% highest posterior density interval (HPD): 536.31–428.44 Mya]
   with median near the Cambrian–Ordovician boundary (485.57 Mya) (SI
   Appendix, Fig. S9). Both the myxinoid and petromyzontiform crowns were
   estimated to have their origins in Mesozoic times, with the myxinoid
   estimates straddling the Jurassic–Cretaceous boundary (95% HPD:
   183.95–103.30 Mya; median: 138.59 Mya) and with the petromyzontiform
   estimates within the Jurassic times (95% HPD: 194.84–163.14 Mya;
   median: 169.82 Mya).

Discussion

   Tethymyxine is significant as being the sole fossil of the crown group
   Myxinoidea. It therefore provides a crucial calibration point for the
   evolution of the myxinoid clade as well as the distinctive morphology
   of the group. In our dataset, the myxinoid topologies were robust to
   altered character coding schemes (assuming taphonomic artifacts) or
   different taxonomic combinations (SI Appendix, Part C and Fig. S8).
   Multiple traits of the myxinoid crown in Tethymyxine are lacking in the
   Carboniferous stem myxinoid Myxinikela. In Myxinikela, the branchial
   apparatus sits well within the cranial domain, and the liver appears to
   be a single lobe. Given its state of preservation, α-keratin in the
   slime glands would have been preserved if present in Myxinikela. Thus,
   these crown myxinoid traits were likely acquired along the remaining
   200–250 My ghost lineage (Fig. 3A).

   Our analyses reveal cyclostomes as a clade using morphological data.
   Both maximum parsimony and Bayesian analyses converged on this result
   with the same clade membership (SI Appendix, Figs. S6 and S7). The
   dataset performed consistently with theoretical predictions (33).
   Maximum parsimony and Bayesian inferences generated trees that are
   largely congruent with each other. The maximum parsimony trees are
   better resolved (more precise) than the Bayesian trees. Importantly,
   cyclostome monophyly based on morphology corroborates the topology
   consistently supported by molecular data (17, 18). The
   fossil-calibrated mitogenomic molecular clock (SI Appendix, Fig. S9)
   also produced divergence estimates for cyclostome crown clades that are
   largely congruent with the previous molecular clock analysis of nuclear
   genes (34). For the cyclostome crown, our divergence estimates
   (536.31–428.44 Mya) agree well with the previous estimates (480–430
   Mya). Calibrated with Tethymyxine (100.5–93.9 Mya), the myxinoid crown
   is now pushed to an older interval (183.95–103.30 Mya) than in the
   previous analysis (90–40 Mya). The petromyzontiform crown is estimated
   shallower (194.84–163.14 Mya) than in the analysis of nuclear genes
   (280–220 Mya), but the split between the southern and northern
   hemispheric clades is constrained to before the separation and breakup
   of Gondwana in both analyses (Fig. 3A and SI Appendix, Fig. S9) (34).

   This morphological–molecular congruence is a significant update of the
   cyclostome hypothesis (Fig. 1 C and E). One principal advance is
   phylogenetic resolution of fossil jawless vertebrates under cyclostome
   monophyly. These fossil forms include (i) putative stem taxa of
   cyclostome lineages (e.g., Myxinikela), and (ii) lineages that have
   been placed on the gnathostome stem under cyclostome paraphyly (e.g.,
   anaspids and euconodonts). Molecular datasets contain no information
   from the fossils, but previous schemes of the cyclostome hypothesis
   assumed the taxa within cyclostomes and the taxa on the gnathostome
   stem without including them all in a single cladistic test (18). The
   stem cyclostome status of anaspids and euconodonts has never been
   supported quantitatively in previous analyses (Fig. 3A and SI Appendix,
   Figs. S6 and S8). Furthermore, our Bayesian analysis (i) did not
   resolve the polytomy of several other lineages with cyclostome and
   gnathostome total clades; and (ii) supported euconodonts as stem
   myxinoids (SI Appendix, Fig. S7). These results are reminiscent of
   early classification schemes of cyclostomes (Fig. 1 A and B) and
   precladistic attempts to classify conodonts, but have the basis in
   different characters.

   Our morphological dataset has a long list of characters that support
   cyclostome monophyly and stem cyclostome status of anaspids and
   euconodonts (SI Appendix, Table S3). The crown has two unambiguous
   synapomorphies in keratinous tooth plates and periocular position of
   trunk myomeres (Fig. 3A). The characters posited previously as
   cyclostome synapomorphies (e.g., pulley-like feeding apparatus) (4) are
   either not preserved in fossils [thus optimized to the crown cyclostome
   node only under delayed transformation (DELTRAN)] or symplesiomorphic
   to cyclostomes. In comparison, keratin is decay-resistant relative to
   other soft tissues (25), and myomeric positions can be determined using
   a number of osteological correlates, such as postbranchial wall in
   osteostracans (10). As for euconodonts, their position in the
   cyclostome stem is supported by the lack of anterior extension of the
   midline fin and the presence of denticulate elements within the buccal
   cavity (SI Appendix, Table S3). Recent attempts to associate conodonts
   with cyclostomes (or myxinoids) were based on the inferred presence of
   a pulley-like feeding apparatus (35) or the alleged homology of
   conodont elements with the keratinous tooth plates in living
   cyclostomes (36, 37). Both of these characters were coded as ambiguous
   in euconodonts in our dataset (SI Appendix, Fig. S7). Nevertheless, the
   Bayesian inferences supported the stem-myxinoid position. For
   parsimony, the cyclostome crown collapsed after coding these ambiguous
   characters for conodonts as seen in living cyclostomes (SI Appendix,
   Fig. S8C).

   The morphological support for cyclostome monophyly emerged after
   enhancement of contingency coding method. Nearly all cyclostome
   synapomorphies in our dataset were included in previous morphological
   datasets in various definitions and coding schemes, and would have been
   optimized as cyclostome synapomorphies if the topology were constrained
   (SI Appendix, Table S4). These datasets suggest a number of other
   characters as potentially synapomorphic to cyclostomes under the same
   topological constraint. In our dataset, most of those additional
   characters are symplesiomorphic to cyclostomes (denoted with “§,” SI
   Appendix, Table S4) optimized in opposite character polarity (**), or
   parsimony-uninformative and not included (‡)—all consequences of
   assigning nonapplicable scores within those characters (SI Appendix,
   Parts D and E). Recoding nonapplicable scores to discrete character
   states resurrected paraphyletic cyclostomes (SI Appendix, Fig. S8A).

   Our phylogeny implies hagfish morphology as specialized, not primitive.
   In myxinoids, trait absence or underdeveloped condition has been
   difficult to interpret—whether the absence (e.g., electroreceptors or
   extrinsic eye musculature) represents an ancestral or secondary
   condition, or whether the underdeveloped traits (e.g., vertebrae) are
   rudimentary or vestigial. Hagfish nested within cyclostomes suggest
   that these are derived states. Indeed, a large number of reversal
   events are optimized between the total and crown myxinoid nodes under
   both accelerated transformation (ACCTRAN) and DELTRAN (SI Appendix,
   Table S3). Regarding those listed traits, hagfish appear to have lost
   them secondarily, in line with the narrative of the cyclostome
   hypothesis (5, 38). These character changes are parallel with
   acquisitions of the traits unique to hagfish, such as slime glands (SI
   Appendix, Table S3). Even cyclostomes on the whole appear to be rather
   specialized than primitive. The last common ancestor of all living
   vertebrates has often been posited as a soft-bodied
   hagfish/lamprey-like form (1). However, the stem cyclostome status of
   anaspids and euconodonts in the new phylogeny implies that the
   potential to mineralize skeletal matrix predated the cyclostome crown.
   This scenario is consistent with observations that modern hagfish and
   lampreys deposit calcium phosphates to line their inner ears (39), or
   that lamprey cartilages spontaneously calcify in vitro (40).

Conclusions

   An assessment of nonindependence among morphological characters may
   lead to unexpected congruence when a phylogenetic dispute is locked in
   a stalemate between internally consistent morphological and molecular
   inferences. Our phylogenetic analysis of cyclostomes provides one such
   case study. In this phylogeny of cyclosotmes, the new fossil hagfish
   Tethymyxine represents an important calibration point not just for the
   divergence of the myxinoid crown, but also for many morphological
   traits (e.g., slime glands) that set hagfish apart from all other
   vertebrates. The morphologically supported Cyclostomi implies some of
   the characters conventionally considered primitive in hagfish (e.g.,
   the absence of extraocular muscles, electroreceptors, or taste buds) as
   specialized. This view is consistent with the developmental features of
   hagfish interpreted as vestigial and derived (e.g., axial skeleton)
   (38, 41). Between two living cyclostome lineages, lampreys may serve as
   a better outgroup to gnathostomes, but a full extent of their utility
   as an outgroup remains unknown until evolutionary origins of the
   peculiar life history (distinct larval phase with dramatic
   metamorphosis) are resolved (42, 43).

Methods

   SRS-XRF was performed at beam line 6–2 at the Stanford Synchrotron
   Radiation Lightsource (SSRL), SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory.
   SRS-XRF is a noninvasive technique that can spatially resolve chemical
   element composition in large samples in short time frames (44). For the
   new phylogeny, three lines of analyses were performed: (i) maximum
   parsimony analyses; (ii) nonclock Bayesian analyses; and (iii) clock
   analyses. The morphological dataset was the same for all of the
   analyses and included 52 taxa (SI Appendix, Table S2) and 168
   characters (SI Appendix, Part E). For the parsimony analyses, heuristic
   search was used with no topological constraint. For the non-clock-based
   Bayesian analyses, each analysis was run for 5 million generations with
   2 runs of 4 chains, without topological constraint, and sampling every
   5,000 generations. Finally, we generated a dataset with 16S and COI
   sequences for extant taxa and with fossil calibrations. This dataset
   was subjected to a Bayesian analysis under the fossilized birth–death
   model, given topology obtained from the parsimony analysis. This
   analysis provided divergence estimates shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S9.
   For full description, see SI Appendix, Parts B–E. Original data for
   SRS-XRF and phylogenetic analyses are placed in a permanent depository
   (45).

Significance

   The Pólya–Jensen criterion for the Riemann hypothesis asserts that RH
   is equivalent to the hyperbolicity of certain Jensen polynomials for
   all degrees d≥1 and all shifts n. For each degree d≥1, we confirm this
   criterion for all sufficiently large shifts n. This represents a
   theoretical advance in the field. The method of proof is rooted in the
   newly discovered phenomenon that these polynomials are nicely
   approximated by Hermite polynomials. Furthermore, it is shown that this
   method applies to a large class of related problems.

Abstract

   In 1927, Pólya proved that the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the
   hyperbolicity of Jensen polynomials for the Riemann zeta function ζ(s)
   at its point of symmetry. This hyperbolicity has been proved for
   degrees d≤3. We obtain an asymptotic formula for the central
   derivatives ζ(2n)(1/2) that is accurate to all orders, which allows us
   to prove the hyperbolicity of all but finitely many of the Jensen
   polynomials of each degree. Moreover, we establish hyperbolicity for
   all d≤8. These results follow from a general theorem which models such
   polynomials by Hermite polynomials. In the case of the Riemann zeta
   function, this proves the Gaussian unitary ensemble random matrix model
   prediction in derivative aspect. The general theorem also allows us to
   prove a conjecture of Chen, Jia, and Wang on the partition function.

1. Introduction and Statement of Results

   Expanding on notes of Jensen, Pólya (1) proved that the Riemann
   hypothesis (RH) is equivalent to the hyperbolicity of the Jensen
   polynomials for the Riemann zeta function ζ(s) at its point of
   symmetry. More precisely, he showed that the RH is equivalent to the
   hyperbolicity of all Jensen polynomials associated with the sequence of
   Taylor coefficients {γ(n)} defined
   by−1+4z2 Λ12+z=∑n=0∞γ(n)n!⋅z2n,[1]where Λ(s)=π−s/2Γ(s/2)ζ(s)=Λ(1−s),
   where we say that a polynomial with real coefficients is hyperbolic if
   all of its zeros are real, and where the Jensen polynomial of degree d
   and shift n of an arbitrary sequence {α(0),α(1),α(2),…} of real numbers
   is the polynomialJαd,n(X)≔∑j=0ddjα(n+j)Xj.[2]Thus, the RH is equivalent
   to the hyperbolicity of the polynomials Jγd,n(X) for all nonnegative
   integers d and n (1⇓–3). Since this condition is preserved under
   differentiation, to prove RH, it would be enough to show hyperbolicity
   for the Jγd,0(X).* Due to the difficulty of proving RH, research has
   focused on establishing hyperbolicity for all shifts n for small d.
   Previous to this paper, hyperbolicity was known for d≤3 by work^† of
   Csordas et al. (5) and Dimitrov and Lucas (3).

   Asymptotics for the γ(n) were obtained from Coffey (6) and Pustyl’nikov
   (7). We improve on their results by obtaining an arbitrary precision
   asymptotic formula^‡(Theorem 9), a result that is of independent
   interest. We will use this strengthened result to prove the following
   theorem for all degrees d.

Theorem 1.

   If d≥1, then Jγd,n(X) is hyperbolic for all sufficiently large n.

   An effective proof of Theorem 1 for small d gives the following
   theorem.

Theorem 2.

   If 1≤d≤8, then Jγd,n(X) is hyperbolic for every n≥0.

   Theorem 1 follows from a general phenomenon that Jensen polynomials for
   a wide class of sequences α can be modeled by the Hermite polynomials
   Hd(X), which we define (in a somewhat nonstandard normalization) as the
   orthogonal polynomials for the measure μ(X)=e−X2/4 or more explicitly
   by the generating
   function∑d=0∞Hd(X) tdd! = e−t2+Xt = 1 +X t + (X2−2) t22! + (X3−6X) t33!
    + ⋯ .[3]More precisely, we will prove the following general theorem
   describing the limiting behavior of Jensen polynomials of sequences
   with appropriate growth.

Theorem 3.

   Let {α(n)}, {A(n)}, and {δ(n)} be three sequences of positive real
   numbers with δ(n) tending to zero and
   satisfyinglogα(n+j)α(n)=A(n)j−δ(n)2j2+oδ(n)d as n→∞,[4]for some integer
   d≥1 and all 0≤j≤d. Then, we
   havelimn→∞δ(n)−dα(n) Jαd,nδ(n) X − 1exp(A(n)) = Hd(X),[5]uniformly for
   X in any compact subset of R.

   Since the Hermite polynomials have distinct roots, and since this
   property of a polynomial with real coefficients is invariant under
   small deformation, we immediately deduce the following corollary.

Corollary 4.

   The Jensen polynomials Jαd,n(X) for a sequence α:N→R satisfying the
   conditions in Theorem 3 are hyperbolic for all but finitely many values
   n.

   Theorem 1 is a special case of this corollary. Namely, we shall use
   Theorem 9 to prove that the Taylor coefficients {γ(n)} satisfy the
   required growth conditions in Theorem 3 for every d≥2.

   Theorem 3 in the case of the Riemann zeta function is the derivative
   aspect Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE) random matrix model prediction
   for the zeros of Jensen polynomials. To make this precise, recall that
   Dyson (8), Montgomery (9), and Odlyzko (10) conjecture that the
   nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function are distributed like the
   eigenvalues of random Hermitian matrices. These eigenvalues satisfy
   Wigner’s Semicircular Law, as do the roots of the Hermite polynomials
   Hd(X), when suitably normalized, as d→+∞ (see chapter 3 of ref. 11).
   The roots of Jγd,0(X), as d→+∞, approximate the zeros of Λ12+z (see
   ref. 1 or lemma 2.2 of ref. 12), and so GUE predicts that these roots
   also obey the Semicircular Law. Since the derivatives of Λ12+z are also
   predicted to satisfy GUE, it is natural to consider the limiting
   behavior of Jγd,n(X) as n→+∞. The work here proves that these
   derivative aspect limits are the Hermite polynomials Hd(X), which, as
   mentioned above, satisfy GUE in degree aspect.

   Returning to the general case of sequences with suitable growth
   conditions, Theorem 3 has applications in combinatorics where the
   hyperbolicity of polynomials determines the log-concavity of
   enumerative statistics. For example, see the classic theorem by
   Heilmann and Leib (13), along with works by Chudnovsky and Seymour
   (14), Haglund (15), Haglund et al. (16), Stanley (17), and Wagner (18),
   to name a few. Theorem 3 represents a criterion for establishing the
   hyperbolicity of polynomials in enumerative combinatorics. The theorem
   reduces the problem to determining whether suitable asymptotics hold.
   Here, we were motivated by a conjecture of Chen, Jia, and Wang
   concerning the Jensen polynomials Jpd,n(X), where p(n) is the partition
   function. Nicolas (19) and Desalvo and Pak (20) proved that Jp2,n(X) is
   hyperbolic for n≥25, and, more recently, Chen et al. proved (21) that
   Jp3,n(X) is hyperbolic for n≥94, inspiring them to state as a
   conjecture the following result.

Theorem 5 (Chen–Jia–Wang Conjecture).

   For every integer d≥1, there exists an integer N(d) such that Jpd,n(X)
   is hyperbolic for n≥N(d).

   Table 1 gives the conjectured minimal value for N(d) for d=2j with
   1≤j≤5. More precisely, for each d≤32 it gives the smallest integer such
   that Jpd,n(X) is hyperbolic for N(d) ≤ n ≤ 50,000.

Remark 6:

   Larson and Wagner (22) have made the proof of Theorem 5 effective by a
   brute-force implementation of Hermite’s criterion (see theorem C of
   ref. 3). They showed that the values in the table are correct for d=4
   and d=5 and that N(d)≤(3d)24d(50d)3d2 in general. The true values are
   presumably much smaller and are probably of only polynomial growth, the
   numbers N(d) in the table being approximately of size 10 d2⁡log⁡d.

   Theorem 5 suggests a natural generalization. As is well known, the
   numbers p(n) are the Fourier coefficients of a modular form,
   namely,1η(τ) = ∑n=0∞ p(n) qn−124 (I(τ)>0, q=e2πiτ),[6]where
   η(τ)=q1/24∏(1−qn) is the Dedekind eta-function. Theorem 5 is then an
   example of a more general theorem about the Jensen polynomials of the
   Fourier coefficients of an arbitrary weakly holomorphic modular form,
   which, for the purposes of this work, will mean a modular form
   (possibly of fractional weight and with multiplier system) with real
   Fourier coefficients on the full modular group SL2(Z) that is
   holomorphic apart from a pole of (possibly fractional) positive order
   at infinity. If f is such a form, we denote its Fourier expansion by^§
   f(τ) = ∑n∈−m+Z≥0af(n) qn (m∈Q>0, af(−m) ≠ 0).[7]Then, we will prove the
   following theorem, which includes Theorem 5.

Theorem 7.

   If f is a weakly holomorphic modular form as above, then for any fixed
   d≥1, the Jensen polynomials Jafd,n(X) are hyperbolic for all
   sufficiently large n.

   Our results are proved by showing that each of the sequences of
   interest to us [the partition function, the Fourier coefficients of
   weakly holomorphic modular forms, and the Taylor coefficients at s=12
   of 4s(1−s)Λ(s)] satisfies the hypotheses of Theorem 3, which we prove
   in Section 2. Actually, in Section 2, we prove a more general result
   (Theorem 8) that gives the limits of suitably normalized Jensen
   polynomials for an even bigger class of sequences having suitable
   asymptotic properties (but without necessarily the corollary about
   hyperbolicity). Theorem 7 giving the hyperbolicity for coefficients of
   modular forms (and hence also for the partition function) is proved in
   Section 3. In Section 4, we prove Theorem 9, which gives an asymptotic
   formula to all orders for the Taylor coefficients of Λ(s) at s=12, and
   in Section 5, we prove Theorems 1 and 2 for the Riemann zeta function
   by using these asymptotics to verify that the hypotheses of Theorem 3
   are fulfilled by the numbers γ(n). We conclude in Section 6 with some
   numerical examples.

2. Proof of Theorem 3

   We deduce Theorem 3 from the following more general result.

Theorem 8.

   Suppose that {E(n)} and {δ(n)} are positive real sequences with δ(n)
   tending to 0, and that F(t)=∑i=0∞citi is a formal power series with
   complex coefficients. For a fixed d≥1, suppose that there are real
   sequences {C0(n)},…,{Cd(n)}, with limn→+∞Ci(n)=ci for 0≤i≤d, such that
   for 0≤j≤d, we
   haveα(n+j)α(n) E(n)−j = ∑i=0d Ci(n) δ(n)iji + oδ(n)d as n→+∞.[8]Then,
   the conclusion of Theorem 3 holds with  exp(A(n))  replaced by E(n) and
   Hd(X) replaced by HF,d(X), where the polynomials HF,m(X)∈C[x] are now
   defined either by the generating function F(−t) eXt=∑HF,m(X) tm/m! or
   in closed form by HF,m(X) ≔ m! ∑k=0m(−1)m−kcm−k Xk/k! .

Proof of Theorems 8 and 3.

   After replacing exp(A(n)) by E(n), the polynomial appearing on the
   left-hand side of [5]
   becomesδ(n)−dα(n) Jαd,nδ(n) X − 1E(n) = ∑k=0ddk δ(n)k−d ∑j=kd (−1)j−k d
   −kj−k α(n+j)α(n)E(n)j Xk.Since 0≤j≤d, and since the error term in [8]
   is o(δ(n)d), we may reorder summation and find that the limiting value
   as n→+∞ of the quantity in square brackets
   satisfieslimn→+∞∑i=0dCi(n) δ(n)k−d+i ∑j=kd(−1)j−k d−kj−k ji = (−1)d−k(d
   −k)! cd−k,because the inner sum, which is the (d−k)th difference of the
   polynomial j↦ji evaluated at j=0, vanishes for i<d−k and equals (d−k)!
   for i=d−k. Theorem 8 follows, and Theorem 3 is just the special case
   E(n)=eA(n) and F(t)=e−t2. □

3. Proof of Theorem 7

   Assume that f is a modular form of (possibly fractional) weight k on
   SL2(Z) (possibly with multiplier system) and with a pole of (possibly
   fractional) order m>0 at infinity and write its Fourier expansion at
   infinity as in [7]. It is standard, either by the circle method of
   Hardy–Ramanujan–Rademacher or by using Poincaré series (for example,
   see ref. 23), that the Fourier coefficients of f have the asymptotic
   formaf(n)=Af nk−12 Ik−1(4πmn)+OnC e2πmn,[9]as n→∞ for some nonzero
   constants Af [an explicit multiple of af(−m)] and C, where Iκ(x)
   denotes the usual I-Bessel function. In view of the expansion of Bessel
   functions at infinity, this implies that af(n) has an asymptotic
   expansion to all orders in 1/n of the
   formaf(n) ∼ e4πmn n2k−34 expc0 + c1n + c2n2 + ⋯,for some constants
   c0, c1, …  depending on f [and in fact only on m and k if we normalize
   the leading coefficient af(−m) of f to be equal to 1]. This gives an
   asymptotic
   expansionlogaf(n+j)af(n) ∼ 4πm ∑i=1∞1/2ijini−12 + 2k−34∑i=1∞(−1)i−1jii 
   ni + ∑i,k≥1ck−kijini+k,[10]valid to all orders in n, and it follows
   that the sequence {af(n)} satisfies the hypotheses of Theorem 3 with
   A(n)=2πm/n+O(1/n) and δ(n)=(π/2)1/2m1/4n−3/4+O(n−5/4). Theorem 7 then
   follows from the corollary to Theorem 3.

4. Asymptotics for Λ(n)(12)

   Previous work of Coffey (6) and Pustyl’nikov (7) offer asymptotics^¶
   for the derivatives Λ(n)12. Here, we follow a slightly different
   approach and obtain effective asymptotics, a result which is of
   independent interest. To describe our asymptotic expansion, we first
   give a formula for these derivatives in terms of an auxiliary function,
   whose asymptotic expansion we shall then determine.

   Following Riemann (cf. chapter 8 of ref. 25), we
   haveΛ(s)=∫0∞ts2−1 θ0(t) dt=1s(s−1)+∫1∞ts2+t1−s2 θ0(t) dtt,where
   θ0(t)=∑k=1∞e−πk2t=12(t−1/2−1)+t−1/2θ0(1/t). It follows
   thatΛ(n)12=− 2n+2 n!+F(n)2n−1,[11]for n>0 (both are of course zero for
   n odd), where F(n) is defined for any real n≥0
   byF(n)=∫1∞(log⁡t)n t−3/4 θ0(t) dt.[12]In particular, if n is a positive
   integer, then the Taylor coefficients γ(n) defined in [1]
   satisfyγ(n)=n!(2n)!⋅82n2Λ(2n−2)12−Λ(2n)12=n!(2n)!⋅ 322n2F(2n−2)−F(2n)22
   n−1.[13]

Theorem 9.

   If n>0, then the function F(n) defined by [12] is given to all orders
   in n by the asymptotic
   expansionF(n) ∼ 2π Ln+1(1+L)n−34L2 eL/4−n/L+3/4 1+b1n+b2n2+⋯ (n→∞),wher
   e L=L(n)≈lognlog⁡n is the unique positive solution of the equation
   n=L(πeL+34) and each coefficient bk belongs to Q(L), the first value
   being b1=2L4+9L3+16L2+6L+224 (L+1)3.

Example 10:

   Here, we illustrate Theorem 9. The two-term
   approximationF(n) ≈ 2π Ln+1(1+L)n−34L2 eL/4−n/L+3/4 1+b1n=:F^(n),is
   sufficiently strong for the proof of Theorem 1. In particular, Theorem
   9 and [13] implyγ^(n)≔n!(2n)!26−2n2n2F^(2n−2)=γ(n)1+O1n2−ε.[14]Here are
   some approximations γ^(n) obtained from this expression by numerically
   computing L using its defining equation above. Table 2 illustrates the
   high precision of this formula.

   Table 2.

   Comparison of γ(n) and γ^(n)

Proof of Theorem 9:

   We approximate the integrand in [12] by f(t)=(log⁡t)nt−3/4e−πt (from
   now on, we consider n as fixed and omit it from the notations). We have
   tddtlog⁡f(t)=nlog⁡t−πt−34, so f(t) assumes its unique maximum at t=a,
   where a=eL is the solution in (1,∞) ofn=πa+34log⁡a.We can then apply
   the usual saddle point method. The Taylor expansion of f(t) around t=a
   is given
   byf(1+λ)af(a)=1+log(1+λ)log⁡an(1+λ)−3/4e−πλa=e−Cλ2/21+A3λ3+A4λ4+⋯,where
   C=(ε+ε2)n−34 (here we have set ε=1log⁡a=L−1) and the Ai (i≥3) are
   polynomials of degree ⌊i/3⌋ in n with coefficients in Q[ε]. This
   expansion is found by expanding log(f((1+λ)a))−log(f(a)) in λ. The
   linear term vanishes by the choice of a, the quadratic term is −Cλ2/2,
   and the coefficients of the higher powers of λ are all linear
   expressions in n with coefficients in Q[ε]. Exponentiating this
   expansion gives the claimed expression for f((1+λ)a)/f(a), where the
   dominant term of each Ai is governed primarily by the exponential of
   the cubic term of the logarithmic expansion. The first few Ai
   areA3=ε3+ε22+ε33 n−14, A4=−ε4+11ε224+ε32+ε44 n+316,A5=ε5+5ε212+7ε312+ε4
   2+ε55 n − 320,A6=ε218+ε36+17ε472+ε56+ε618 n2 − ε4+91ε2180+17ε324+17ε424
   +ε52+ε66 n+532.Plugging in t=(1+λ)a immediately gives the asymptotic
   expansion∫1∞f(t) dt=a f(a) ∫−1+1/a∞e−Cλ2/21+A3λ3+A4λ4+⋯ dλ=a f(a) 2πC 1
   +3A4C2+15A6C3+⋯+(2i−1)!!A2iCi+⋯.(Here, only the part of the integral
   with Cλ2<B⁡log⁡n, where B is any function of n going to infinity as n
   does, contributes.) This equality and the expression in Theorem 9 are
   interpreted as asymptotic expansions. Although these series themselves
   may not converge for a fixed n, we may truncate the resulting
   approximation at O(n−A) for some A>0, and as n→+∞, this approximation
   becomes true to the specified precision. Substituting into this
   expansion the formulas for C and Ai in terms of n, we obtain the
   statement of the theorem with F(n) replaced by the integral over f(t),
   with only A2i (i≤3k) contributing to bk. But then the same asymptotic
   formula holds also for F(n), since the ratio f(t)/θ0(t)=1+e−3πt+⋯  is
   equal to 1+O(n−K) for any K>0 for t near a. □

5. Proof of Theorems 1 and 2

A. Proof of Theorem 1

   For each d≥1, we use Theorem 3 with sequences {A(n)} and {δ(n)} for
   whichlogγ(n+j)γ(n)=A(n)j−j2δ(n)2+∑i=3dgi(n)ji+oδ(n)d,[15]for all 0≤j≤d,
   where gi(n)=oδ(n)i. Stirling’s formula, [13], and [14]
   giveγ(n)=en−2nn+12(1+112n)Ln^2n^−3n^n^+12(1+112n^)2πK⋅expL4−n^L+341+b1(
   n^)n^1+O1n2−ε,[16]where n^≔2n−2, L≔L(n^), and
   K≔K(n^)≔L(n^)−1+L(n^)−2n^−3/4. The L(n^) are values of a nonvanishing
   holomorphic function for R(n)>1, and so for |j|<n−1, we have the Taylor
   expansionL(j;n)≔L(n^+2j)L(n^)=1+∑m≥1ℓm(n)jmm!.If J=λ(n−1) with −1<λ<1,
   then the asymptotic L(n)≈log(nlog⁡n)
   implieslimn→+∞L(J,n)=limn→+∞Ln^(λ+1)L(n^)=1.In particular, we have
   ℓ1(n)=2K⋅L2 and ℓ2(n)=−8(n^−3/4L)(1+L/2)K3⋅L5 and ℓm(n)=o1(n−1)m. By a
   similar argument applied
   toK(j;n)≔K(n^+2j)K(n^)=1+∑m≥1km(n)jmm! and B(j;n)≔1+b1(n^+2j)n^+2j1+b1(
   n^)n^=1+∑m≥1βm(n)jmm!,we find that βm(n)=o1(n−1)m+1,
   k1(n)=2(L+1)K⋅L2−2n^(L+2)K2L4, and km(n)=o1(n−1)m for m≥2.

   Let R(j;n) be the approximation for γ(n+j)/γ(n) obtained from [16]. We
   then expand log⁡R(j;n)=:∑m≥1gm(n)jm, with the idea that we will choose
   A(n)∼g1(n) and δ(n)∼−g2(n). To this end, if J=λ(n−1) for −1<λ<1, then a
   calculation reveals
   that−(1+λ)log(1+λ)=limn→+∞log⁡R(J;n)−J⁡lognL24n^2−Jn−1.[17]Therefore,
   gm(n)=O(n−1)1−m, and algebraic manipulations
   giveg1(n)=lognL24n^2+n^ℓ1(n)L+1L−2L+ℓ1(n)⋅L4−k1(n)2+O1n2−ε,g2(n)=−1n^+4
   ℓ1(n)+n^ℓ2(n)L+12L−n^ℓ1(n)2L+22L+O1n2−ε.Using the formulas for
   ℓ1(n), ℓ2(n), and k1(n) above, we
   defineδ(n)≔1n^−2L2⋅K and A(n)≔lognL24n^2+L−1L2⋅K+n^(L+2)L4⋅K2.[18]The
   bounds for the gm(n) and the asymptotics above imply the o(1) error
   term in [15], and also that for sufficiently large n we have 0<δ(n)→0.
   Therefore, Theorem 3 applies, and its corollary gives Theorem 1.

B. Sketch of the Proof of Theorem 2

   Let A(n) and δ(n) be as in [18]. If we
   letJ^γd,n(X)≔δ(n)−dγ(n)⋅Jγd,nδ(n) X − 1exp(A(n))=∑k=0dβkd,nXk,then
   Theorem 1 implies that limn→+∞J^γd,n(X)=Hd(X) =: ∑k=0dhkXk. We have
   confirmed the hyperbolicity of the J^γd,n(X) for n≤106 and 4≤d≤8 using
   Hermite’s criterion (see theorem C of ref. 3).

   Using this criterion, we also chose vectors εd≔(εd(d),εd(d−1),…,εd(0))
   of positive numbers and signs sd,sd−1,…,s0∈{±1} for which J^γd,n(X) is
   hyperbolic if 0≤sk(βkd,n−hk)<εd(k) for all k. To make use of these
   inequalities, for positive integers n and 1≤j≤8, define real numbers
   C(n,j) byγ(n+j)γ(n)eA(n)j⋅eδ(n)2j2=1+C(n,j)n3/2.[19]Using an effective
   form of [16], it can be shown^∥ that 0<C(n,j)<14.25 for all n≥7 and
   1≤j≤8. Finally, we determined numbers Mεd for which the required
   inequalities hold for n≥Mεd. The proof follows from the fact that we
   found suitable choices for which Mεd<106.

Example 11:

   We illustrate the case of d=4 using ε4≔(0.041,1.384,0.813,7.313,0.804).
   For n≥100 the odd degree coefficients
   satisfy0<β34,n<28 δ(n) and −145.70δ(n)<β14,n<0,while the even degree
   coefficients
   satisfy1−16.05 δ(n)2<β44,n<1, −12<β24,n<−12+16.20 δ(n), 12−16.01 δ(n)<β
   04,n<12.It turns out that Mε4≔104<106.

6. Examples

   For convenience, we let the J^αd,n(X) denote the polynomials which
   converge to Hd(X) in [5]. We now illustrate Theorem 7 with [6], where
   m=1/24 and k=−1/2. Using [10], we may choose A(n)=2π24n−1−2424n−1 and
   δ(n)=12π(24n−1)3/2−288(24n−1)2. Although the one-term approximations of
   [10] given at the end of Section 3 also satisfy Theorem 3, the two-term
   approximations converge more quickly and better illustrate the result.
   With these data, we observe in Table 3 indeed that the degree 2 and 3
   partition Jensen polynomials are modeled by H2(X)=X2−2 and H3(X)=X3−6X.

Significance

   Nanoparticle-mediated delivery of siRNA to hepatocytes has treated
   disease in humans. However, systemically delivering RNA drugs to
   nonliver tissues remains an important challenge. To increase the number
   of nanoparticles that could be studied in vivo, we designed a
   high-throughput method to measure how >100 nanoparticles delivered mRNA
   that was translated into functional protein in vivo. We quantified how
   >250 lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) delivered mRNA in vivo, identifying two
   LNPs that deliver mRNA to endothelial cells. One of the LNPs
   codelivered Cas9 mRNA and single-guide RNA in vivo, leading to
   endothelial cell gene editing. This approach can identify nanoparticles
   that target new cells.

Abstract

   Dysfunctional endothelium causes more disease than any other cell type.
   Systemically administered RNA delivery to nonliver tissues remains
   challenging, in large part because there is no high-throughput method
   to identify nanoparticles that deliver functional mRNA to cells in
   vivo. Here we report a system capable of simultaneously quantifying how
   >100 lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) deliver mRNA that is translated into
   functional protein. Using this system (named FIND), we measured how
   >250 LNPs delivered mRNA to multiple cell types in vivo and identified
   7C2 and 7C3, two LNPs that efficiently deliver siRNA, single-guide RNA
   (sgRNA), and mRNA to endothelial cells. The 7C3 delivered Cas9 mRNA and
   sgRNA to splenic endothelial cells as efficiently as hepatocytes,
   distinguishing it from LNPs that deliver Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA to
   hepatocytes more than other cell types. These data demonstrate that
   FIND can identify nanoparticles with novel tropisms in vivo.

   A lipid nanoparticle (LNP) siRNA therapy targeted to hepatocytes (1, 2)
   has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This
   advance is exciting, but its long-term implications are tempered by the
   fact that clinical LNP therapies have targeted hepatocytes (when
   administered systemically) (1, 3) and muscle (when administered
   locally) (4). In mice, nanoparticles have delivered Cas9 mRNA and
   ribonucleoproteins via systemic or local injection (5⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓–12).
   Systemically administered Cas9 delivery to nonliver tissues remains a
   challenge. When LNPs are administered systemically, they display an
   affinity for the liver; this is thought to be driven by natural
   physiological advantages including slow blood flow (13, 14) and
   discontinuous vasculature in hepatic sinusoids (15). One additional
   reason most LNPs target the liver may be the process by which they are
   selected. LNPs are screened in vitro before a few LNPs are tested in
   vivo. In vitro LNP delivery can predict in vivo LNP delivery to
   hepatocytes (16), but in vitro nanoparticle can be a poor predictor of
   in vivo delivery to endothelial cells and macrophages (17). Moreover,
   LNP siRNA delivery is often tested in vivo using the FVII assay, which
   predicts hepatocyte delivery; this assay is enhanced by its ease, as
   well as the fact that validated, potent siRNA targeting FVII is
   available (18, 19). It is possible that LNPs target hepatocytes in part
   because established assays select for hepatocyte delivery.

   We reasoned that measuring hundreds of distinct LNPs in vivo would
   provide the best chance of identifying nanoparticles that deliver mRNA
   to new cell types. Using DNA barcodes (17, 20⇓–22), we previously
   quantified how >350 LNPs distributed in vivo. However, biodistribution
   is necessary, but not sufficient, for functional RNA delivery. Over 96%
   of RNA delivered into the endosome of a target cell can be degraded
   (23, 24), and cell-type-specific changes in endosomal escape are not
   understood (25). Thus, it is difficult to predict functional delivery
   using biodistribution. As a result, a high-throughput method to
   quantify functional, cytosolic delivery of mRNA in vivo could
   accelerate the discovery of clinically relevant LNPs.

   An ideal system would (i) enable scientists to test many LNPs
   simultaneously, (ii) utilize commonly available animal models, (iii)
   rely on a robust signal, and (iv) measure functional RNA delivery to
   any combinations of cell types in vivo. Measuring delivery to
   “on-target” cells and “off-target” cells would enable iterative screens
   to improve LNP specificity. We designed a system named Fast
   Identification of Nanoparticle Delivery (FIND) that meets these
   criteria. FIND measures cytosolic mRNA delivery by >100 LNPs in vivo to
   any combination of cell types. We quantified how >250 LNPs functionally
   delivered mRNA to multiple cell types in vivo and identified two
   formulations that deliver RNA to endothelial beds. FIND is a system
   that facilitates high-throughput screens of functional mRNA delivery
   and may identify LNPs with novel tropisms.

Results

   FIND combined rationally designed DNA barcodes and the Cre-Lox system
   to generate a multiplexed readout of functional mRNA delivery. FIND is
   distinct from previous barcoding systems we developed, which measure
   biodistribution (Fig. 1A). Using high-throughput microfluidics (26), we
   coformulated LNPs with Cre mRNA and a unique DNA barcode. LNP-1, with
   chemical structure 1, carried DNA barcode 1 and Cre mRNA; LNP-N, with
   chemical structure N, carried DNA barcode N and Cre mRNA (Fig. 1 A–C).
   We characterized the size and stability of each LNP using dynamic light
   scattering (DLS) and discarded LNPs that did not meet two criteria: (i)
   diameters between 20 and 200 nm and (ii) an autocorrelation curve with
   one inflection point (SI Appendix, Fig. S1A). LNPs that met these
   criteria were pooled together and administered to Lox-Stop-Lox-tdTomato
   (Ai14) mice (27). Ai14 cells fluoresce if Cre mRNA is translated into
   Cre protein, which then translocates to the nucleus and edits target
   DNA. We isolated tdTomato^+ cells with FACS and deep-sequenced the
   cells to identify LNPs that delivered mRNA. We reasoned the codelivery
   of mRNA and a 56-nt ssDNA could approximate the codelivery of an mRNA
   encoding a nuclease and guide RNA (28⇓–30). After sequencing tdTomato^+
   cells (Fig. 1C), we ranked LNPs by calculating the “normalized
   delivery” of each barcode. Normalized delivery is analogous to counts
   per million in RNA-sequencing data (Fig. 1D and SI Appendix, Fig. S1B).
   We used barcodes we previously described and validated with a number of
   control experiments (SI Appendix, Fig. S1 C–E) (17, 20, 21).

   FIND is a high-throughput screen for functional mRNA delivery. (A)
   Unlike previous biodistribution screens, which cannot distinguish
   between bound particles, particles stuck in endosomes, and particles
   that delivered RNA into the cytoplasm, FIND identifies LNPs that
   functionally deliver RNA. (B and C) Nanoparticles were formulated to
   carry Cre mRNA and a DNA barcode, before they were administered to Cre
   reporter cell lines or mice. Cells that underwent Cre-mediated genetic
   changes were isolated using FACS, and the DNA barcode was sequenced to
   identify the LNP that delivered the mRNA. (D) LNP barcodes were ranked
   by “normalized delivery”; each sample (e.g., lung 1 vs. heart 1) was
   analyzed individually on a single sequencing run. Using these data, we
   would hypothesize that LNP-1 delivered nucleic acids more efficiently
   to the lungs than LNP-2 and LNP-N. (E) LGSL-R cells were treated with
   naked Cre mRNA or Cre mRNA carrried by Lipofectamine 2000 (L2K). RFP
   expression indicates cytoplasmic Cre mRNA delivery. (F) Alexa 647 and
   RFP intensities after treatment with L2K carrying Cre mRNA and Alexa
   647-labeled DNA barcode. Compared with untreated cells, there are no
   Alexa 647-RFP+ cells, demonstrating that biodistribution is necessary,
   but not sufficient, for cytoplasmic delivery. (G) RFP+ HEK cells as a
   function of the administered Cre mRNA, which was delivered with L2K.
   (H) Normalized DNA barcode delivery for 54 LNPs sequenced from RFP+ HEK
   cells after the administration of 10 ng or 100 ng total mRNA. A high
   degree of correlation between samples suggests that LNPs which deliver
   mRNA at the first dose deliver mRNA at the second dose. (I) RFP+ HEK
   cells following the administration of 54 LNPs (100 ng total mRNA),
   after cells were treated with endocytosis inhibitors. n = 3–4 wells per
   group. **P < 0.01, ****P < 0.0001, two-tailed t test.

   We characterized FIND using in vitro and in vivo experiments. First, we
   cultured HEK.293 cells that expressed LoxP-GFP-Stop-LoxP-RFP (LGSL-RFP)
   under a CMV promoter (Fig. 1B). These cells became RFP^+ 72 h after
   treatment with Cre mRNA carried by Lipofectamine 2000 (L2K), but not
   with naked Cre mRNA, which served as the negative control (Fig. 1E and
   SI Appendix, Fig. S1F). The number of RFP^+ cells after L2K treatment
   increased with dose and time, up to 3 d (SI Appendix, Fig. S1G). We
   then coformulated L2K with Cre mRNA and an Alexa 647-labeled DNA
   barcode. After 24 h, 62, 36, 2, and 0% of the cells were 647^+RFP^−,
   647^+RFP^+, 647^−RFP^−, and 647^−RFP^+, respectively. This indicates
   that biodistribution is required, but not sufficient for functional
   cytosolic delivery, as we expected (Fig. 1F). Untreated cells—used to
   control for autofluorescence—were 647^−RFP^− (Fig. 1F and SI Appendix,
   Fig. S1H).

   We then formulated 54 chemically distinct LNPs (SI Appendix, Fig. S1 I
   and J) carrying Cre mRNA and a unique DNA barcode. We administered the
   LNPs to LGSL-RFP cells with mRNA doses of 10, 100, or 1,000 ng and an
   mRNA:DNA barcode mass ratio of 10:1. We observed a dose-dependent
   increase in RFP^+ cells, with over 80% of the cells RFP^+ 3 d after the
   1,000-ng transfection (Fig. 1G). We sequenced barcodes at all three
   doses, reasoning that barcode delivery at the lowest dose (4% RFP^+
   cells) would predict delivery at the middle dose (20% RFP^+ cells); we
   observed a strong correlation (R^2 > 0.9) between normalized delivery
   at 10-ng and 100-ng doses, suggesting this was the case (Fig. 1H). As a
   control, we sequenced cells treated with 1,000 ng mRNA; in this case,
   the system was saturated (>80% of the cells were RFP^+). As expected,
   the correlation between 1,000 ng and either 10 or 100 ng was weaker (SI
   Appendix, Fig. S1K) than the correlation between the two lower doses;
   importantly, these data indicate that FIND can become saturated as the
   percent of RFP^+ increases. Therefore, varying the dose by the potency
   of the nanoparticles pooled may be critical. We then evaluated whether
   the number of RFP^+ cells decreased after pretreatment with
   chlorpromazine, genistein, or ethylisopropyl amiloride (EIPA), which
   inhibit clathrin-, caveolin-, and macropinocytosis-mediated
   endocytosis, respectively. Compared with control cells that were not
   treated with inhibitors, RFP^+ cells decreased by 40–60%,
   recapitulating results previously obtained with individual LNPs (24,
   31) (Fig. 1I). Taken together, these results led us to conclude that
   FIND could analyze mRNA delivery in vitro.

   We investigated whether FIND could identify nanoparticles that deliver
   mRNA in vivo (Fig. 2 A and B). We formulated 112 LNPs, varying four
   chemical traits that influence LNP delivery in vitro: the lipid-amine
   compound, the molar amount of PEG, the structure of PEG, and the molar
   amount of cholesterol (Fig. 2C and SI Appendix, Fig. S2 A and B).
   Seventy-one LNPs met our two criteria for inclusion and were pooled
   (Fig. 2D). Naked DNA barcode, which should not be delivered as
   efficiently as DNA barcodes in LNPs, was included as a negative
   control. We i.v. injected the pooled LNPs and naked barcode into Ai14
   mice at a 1.5 mg/kg total mRNA dose (average dose 0.021 mg/kg per
   particle). Three days later, we isolated tdTomato^+ lung and kidney
   endothelial cells (tdTomato^+CD31^+CD45^−). Separately, we injected 1.0
   mg/kg total mRNA into mice intramuscularly and isolated immune
   (tdTomato^+CD45^+) and nonimmune (tdTomato^+CD45^−) cells from muscle.
   We gated on PBS-injected Ai14 mice for i.v. injected mice and the
   contralateral limb for intramuscular administration. It was important
   to gate on untreated Ai14 mice instead of C57BL/6J mice; gating on
   C57BL/6J mice could lead to inflated values of tdTomato^+ cells (SI
   Appendix, Fig. S2C). Separately, we administered the same LNPs to
   LGSL-RFP cells in vitro. Several lines of evidence suggested the data
   were robust. In all routes of administration, the naked barcode was
   delivered less efficiently than every LNP (Fig. 2E). Second, 7C1-based
   LNPs, which we previously optimized for in vivo RNA delivery (32), were
   enriched in the top 20% LNPs, compared with the other six lipid-amine
   compounds. (SI Appendix, Fig. S2 D and E). Finally, we reasoned that
   the route of administration would affect delivery; Euclidean
   clustering, a common bioinformatics technique (33) that compares how
   similar/dissimilar groups are to one another, and can be used to study
   nanoparticles in vivo (17, 20), separated intravenous, intramuscular,
   and in vitro delivery into three distinct clusters, as expected (Fig.
   2F).

   are isolated by FACS and DNA barcodes are sequenced. (C) Screen 1
   consisted of a library of 112 distinct LNPs created by formulating
   seven compounds with cholesterol, DOPE, and C14-PEG2000 at 16 different
   mole ratios. (D) DLS analysis of all 112 LNPs from this library; 71
   formed stable LNPs and were included. (E) Normalized DNA delivery in
   kidney and lung endothelial cells (CD31+CD45−) after LNPs were i.v.
   injected, as well as CD45+ and CD45− cells isolated following
   intramuscular injection. (F) In vivo LNP targeting heat map generated
   by unbiased, Euclidean clustering. In vitro LNP delivery, in vivo
   intramuscular delivery, and in vivo i.v. delivery cluster separately,
   as expected.

   We formulated a second LNP library to study how PEG, cholesterol, and
   helper lipids [e.g., dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE)] influence
   delivery to cells in vivo. We focused on 7C1-based LNPs, since 7C1 was
   enriched in the first screen. We varied the PEG molar amount, as well
   as the alkyl length on the PEG-lipid (SI Appendix, Fig. S2F).
   Seventy-eight out of 108 LNPs met our two criteria for inclusion; we
   i.v. administered the pool to the mice at a total mRNA dose of 1.5
   mg/kg. Three days later, we sequenced barcodes from tdTomato^+ lung and
   kidney endothelial cells. LNPs containing C[14] alkyl PEG were enriched
   in lung endothelial cells, whereas LNPs containing C[18] alkyl PEG were
   enriched in kidney endothelial cells (SI Appendix, Fig. S2 G and H). To
   validate the relationship between lung delivery, kidney delivery, and
   PEG structure, we formulated a third LNP library. We formulated 158
   LNPs designed to improve lung delivery relative to kidney delivery by
   only using C[14] alkyl-tail PEG varying helper lipid composition (SI
   Appendix, Fig. S2I). We found 3.75 times more lung endothelial cells
   were tdTomato^+ than kidney endothelial cells, a ratio that was
   significantly higher than the second screen (SI Appendix, Fig. S2J), as
   expected. Consistent with previous results (17, 20), we did not observe
   a relationship between LNP size and delivery to endothelial cells
   between the range of 20–200 nm (SI Appendix, Fig. S2K). The poor
   performance of the naked barcode, enrichment of 7C1, the fact that
   unbiased clustering separated the three routes of administration, and
   the PEG data convinced us FIND was capable of quantifying delivery in
   vivo.

   After completing these in vitro and in vivo validation experiments, we
   selected two LNPs (named 7C2 and 7C3) for more thorough
   characterization (Fig. 3 A and B and SI Appendix, Fig. S3 A and B). The
   7C2 was formulated with 7C1:cholesterol:C14-PEG2000:18:1 Lyso PC at a
   molar ratio of 50:23.5:6.5:20. The 7C3 was formulated with
   7C1:cholesterol:C14-PEG2000:DOPE at a molar ratio of 60:10:25:5. The
   7C2 and 7C3 formed stable LNPs with average diameters between 50 and 80
   nm when formulated with siRNA, single-guide RNA (sgRNA), or mRNA (SI
   Appendix, Fig. S3 C and D). The in vitro endocytosis and functional Cre
   mRNA delivery of both LNPs in LGSL-RFP cells decreased by at least 40%
   when cells were pretreated with chlorpromazine and genistein, relative
   to cells that were not treated with inhibitors. EIPA impacted LNP
   uptake but did not significantly decrease functional delivery in vitro
   (SI Appendix, Fig. S3 E–H). These results suggest 7C2 and 7C3 are
   endocytosed in vitro via several pathways. To study biodistribution,
   7C2 and 7C3 were formulated with a Cy5.5-conjugated DNA barcode and
   i.v. injected into separate mice at a dose of 0.75 mg/kg DNA. Three
   hours later—a time point that is sufficiently long for LNPs to be
   cleared from the blood (34)—Cy5.5 ex vivo fluorescence, normalized by
   tissue weight, was highest in the spleen, kidney, and liver, suggesting
   7C2 and 7C3 distributed to these tissues (Fig. 3C and SI Appendix, Fig.
   S3I).

   Characterization of lead nanoparticles discovered by FIND. (A) The top
   two particles, 7C2 and 7C3, discovered following three rounds of FIND
   are characterized by measuring biodistribution, delivery of siRNA,
   sgRNA. (B) The 7C2 and 7C3 were composed of 7C1 compound, cholesterol,
   C14-PEG2000, and helper lipids, 18:1 Lyso PC and DOPE, respectively.
   (C) Following a 0.75-mg/kg Barcode-Cy5.5 administration,
   biodistribution of 7C2 and 7C3 was quantified and normalized to tissue
   weight. n = 4 miceper group. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, two-way ANOVA. (D)
   Following a 1-mg/kg siICAM2 administration, both 7C2 and 7C3 induced
   ICAM2 protein silencing in endothelial cells by flow cytometry. The 7C2
   demonstrates more robust protein silencing in lung endothelial cells
   than 7C3. n = 4 mice per group. **P < 0.01, two tailed t test. (E–G)
   Following repeat administration of 7C2 and 7C3 at 1.5 mg/kg sgICAM2a
   and sgICAM2b, ICAM2 (E) protein and (F and G) indels were measured in
   endothelial cells isolated from multiple organs using FACS. n = 3–4
   mice per group. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, two-tailed t test.

   We tested whether 7C2 and 7C3 functionally delivered siRNA, sgRNA, and
   mRNA, which are all clinically relevant. We performed our individual
   LNP proof-of-concept experiments with nucleic acids targeting ICAM-2.
   We chose this target for three reasons. First, ICAM-2 is related to a
   number of inflammatory diseases (35, 36). Second, ICAM-2 expression is
   robust on endothelial cells. Third, there is a well-validated
   monoclonal antibody to ICAM-2, which allows us to quantify protein
   expression robustly using FACS.

   First, we formulated the LNPs to carry siRNA targeting ICAM-2. Three
   days after i.v. injecting mice with PBS, 2.0 mg/kg siGFP (a higher dose
   was used to test tolerability), or 1.0 mg/kg siICAM-2, we quantified
   ICAM-2 protein mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) in lung, kidney, and
   splenic endothelial cells using flow cytometry (32, 37). Both siRNAs
   were previously validated and chemically modified to reduce
   immunostimulation and promote on-target mRNA degradation (32, 37) (SI
   Appendix, Fig. S3J). ICAM-2 MFI was constant in PBS- and siGFP-treated
   mice but decreased by 60% in lung endothelial cells isolated from mice
   injected with siICAM-2. The 7C2-mediated delivery of siRNA reduced
   ICAM-2 expression in lung endothelial cells more than in splenic
   endothelial cells, whereas 7C3 silencing was more robust in splenic
   endothelial cells (Fig. 3D and SI Appendix, Fig. S3K). Compared with
   PBS-treated mice, mice injected with 2.0 mg/kg siGFP did not show any
   weight loss or changes in organ weight (SI Appendix, Fig. S3 L–N).

   We then quantified 7C2- and 7C3-mediated sgRNA delivery. We
   coformulated two sgRNAs that were chemically modified at the 5′ and 3′
   termini (38) and injected each at a dose of 0.75 mg/kg into mice that
   constitutively express SpCas9 (39) (SI Appendix, Fig. S3O). After three
   injections, ICAM-2 MFI decreased by up to 90, 75, and 59% in lung,
   spleen, and kidney endothelial cells, respectively for 7C2 (Fig. 3E).
   To confirm protein silencing was mediated by gene editing, we measured
   (40) ICAM-2 insertions and deletions (indels) in lung, spleen, and
   kidney endothelial cells and found between 30 and 70% editing per
   locus, leading to overall ICAM-2 indel percentages of 135, 95, and 123%
   indel, respectively for 7C2 (Fig. 3 F and G and SI Appendix, Fig. S3 P
   and Q). In these experiments, we utilized two sgRNAs per gene; thus,
   the total indel percentage was 200% (100% per site). Compared with PBS
   mice, mice treated with LNPs did not lose weight (SI Appendix, Fig. S3
   R and S). Based on these experiments, we concluded that 7C2 potently
   delivered small RNAs to pulmonary endothelial cells in vivo.

   In our siRNA and sgRNA experiments, 7C2 outperformed 7C3 and potently
   delivered RNAs to pulmonary endothelial cells. We then investigated
   whether the same observations were true for the delivery of large RNAs
   (mRNA). We formulated 7C2 and 7C3 to carry Cre mRNA and injected the
   LNPs into separate mice at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg mRNA (Fig. 4A). Three
   days later, we isolated tdTomato^+ immune cells and endothelial cells
   from the spleen, kidney, heart, lung, and liver, as well as
   hepatocytes. We made two interesting observations. First, contrasting
   the small RNA delivery experiments, 7C3 outperformed 7C2. Second,
   splenic endothelial cells were targeted efficiently (Fig. 4B). Notably,
   relative to splenic endothelial cells, very few immune cells and
   hepatocytes were tdTomato^+ (SI Appendix, Fig. S3 T and U). Given this
   degree of specificity has not been reported to date, we repeated the
   experiment using 34 Ai14 mice over the course of several months. The
   7C3 delivered Cre mRNA to splenic endothelial cells in every experiment
   (Fig. 4C). However, we did observe batch-to-batch variability with
   respect to hepatocyte targeting (Fig. 4 C and D). In 22 of the 34 mice,
   a low percentage of hepatocytes were tdTomato^+ (<13%); in 12 of the 34
   mice, we observed high percentages of tdTomato^+ cells. Averaging data
   from all 34 mice, the number of tdTomato^+ splenic endothelial cells
   (43%) was 2.2 times higher than the number of tdTomato^+ hepatocytes
   (20%) (Fig. 4D). Splenic endothelial cell delivery was also
   dose-dependent (SI Appendix, Fig. S3V). The variable delivery to
   hepatocytes was unlikely to be driven by toxicity; throughout our
   studies, we injected 34 mice with 7C3 and did not observe changes in
   mouse weight or obvious signs of toxicity (SI Appendix, Fig. S3W). We
   were unable to identify the source of batch variability; however, we
   hypothesize it is driven by the polymeric backbone of 7C3 and the
   resulting heterogenous chemical structure. Our data strongly suggest
   that future FIND screens should focus on compounds with defined
   chemical structures, which may be less likely to exhibit biological
   heterogeneity. The data also demonstrate that 7C3 can efficiently
   deliver mRNA to splenic endothelial cells in vivo. Importantly, the 7C2
   and 7C3 formulations both included the lipomer 7C1 but had variable
   molar compositions of helper lipids (18:1 Lyso PC and DOPE), which
   distinguished them chemically from previously described
   endothelial-targeting nanoparticles. The differences in delivery
   between 7C2 and 7C3 provide interesting preliminary evidence that
   suggests changing the composition of helper lipids added to a given
   ionizable amine can alter tropism. The compositions and efficacy of 7C2
   and 7C3 are included in SI Appendix, Fig. S4.

   eight experiments of tdTomato+ splenic endothelial cells and

   (E) Indel percentage in splenic ECs following two injections of 7C3
   carrying Cas9 mRNA and e-sgICAM2 at a mass ratio of 1:1, 3:1, and 5:1.
   (F) Indel percentage in hepatocytes following two injections of 7C3
   carrying Cas9 mRNA and e-sgICAM2 at a mass ratio of 1:1, 3:1, and 5:1.

   Given the difference between small and large RNA delivery, we
   quantified how LNPs codelivered CRISPR-Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA. We
   formulated Cas9 mRNA and two guides targeting ICAM-2 into LNPs at a 3:1
   mass ratio and injected a 2.0 mg/kg total i.v. on day 0 and 2. On day
   7, we isolated endothelial cells from the spleen, lung, kidney, and
   liver, as well as hepatocytes (SI Appendix, Fig. S5A). Splenic
   endothelial cell editing mediated by 7C3 was more robust than editing
   in hepatocytes (SI Appendix, Fig. S5B). Mice injected with 7C2 and 7C3
   did not lose weight, compared with PBS-treated mice (SI Appendix, Fig.
   S5C). These studies were also conducted with sgRNAs that were
   chemically modified at the 5′ and 3′ termini (38); during the course of
   the experiments, two groups demonstrated that heavily modified sgRNAs
   improved in vivo editing (7, 8). We redesigned sgICAM2b with “enhanced”
   modifications (8) (referred to as e-sgICAM2) (SI Appendix, Fig. S5D)
   and formulated 7C3 to carry Cas9 mRNA and e-sgICAM2. Given that
   e-sgICAM2 was more likely to resist degradation in vivo (8), we
   hypothesized that the optimal mass ratio of Cas9 mRNA:sgRNA would
   decrease from 3:1, which is the optimized ratio with minimally
   stablized sgRNAs. To test this, we formulated 7C3 with Cas9
   mRNA:e-sgRNA ratios of 5:1, 3:1, and 1:1, keeping the total injected
   dose constant at 2.0 mg/kg. After injecting mice i.v. with 2.0 mg/kg
   total RNA (Cas9 mRNA + sgRNA) on days 0 and 2, we isolated splenic
   endothelial cells and hepatocytes using FACS on day 7. We observed gene
   editing in splenic endothelial cells and hepatocytes at all
   mRNA-to-sgRNA ratios, with an average of 20% editing in the 1:1 mass
   ratio group (Fig. 4 E and F). As expected, the lower Cas9 mRNA:e-sgRNA
   mass ratio led to increased editing. Once again, mice injected with 7C3
   did not lose weight compared with PBS-treated controls (SI Appendix,
   Fig. S5E). This is a demonstration of systemic Cas9-mediated editing of
   endothelial cells in wild-type mice. These data demonstrate that
   systemically administered nanoparticles can edit endothelial cells, and
   that the ideal Cas9:sgRNA ratio will depend on the relative stability
   of the two molecules.

Discussion

   FIND is a high-throughput method to quantify functional mRNA delivery
   mediated by LNPs. The distinction between biodistribution and
   functional delivery is significant; >96% of delivered RNA does not
   escape the endosome (23, 24), and endosomal escape may vary with cell
   type or disease state (41), making it hard to predict functional
   delivery using biodistribution. Notably, Cre mRNA must be translated in
   the cytoplasm, translocate into the nucleus, and edit target DNA. The
   similarity between these steps and the steps required for
   nuclease-mediated gene editing is one reason we selected a Cre-based
   FIND system. We also chose the Cre-lox system because Ai14 mice are
   well-validated and commonly available (27). Moreover, the Cre-mediated
   signal is strong and does not vary dramatically with time; by contrast,
   a GFP-based system would have a signal that varies hour by hour, making
   FACS gates impossible to interpret during a long experimental day.

   Although we focused on endothelial cells, FIND is agnostic to cell
   type; we envision FIND studies that identify LNPs targeting other
   cells. Ai14 mice have recently been used to monitor LNP-mediated
   delivery to immune populations at a cellular resolution (42). Given
   that on- and off-target cells can be isolated from the same mouse, FIND
   may also be used to identify (or iteratively evolve) LNPs with high
   therapeutic windows. To further increase the ratio of splenic
   endothelial cell:hepatocyte delivery, we could incorporate
   endothelial-cell-targeting ligands (43, 44).

   More generally, this ability to study how hundreds of LNPs target
   combinations of cells in vivo may elucidate relationships between LNP
   structure and in vivo functional delivery. In this case, FIND enabled
   us to quickly identify two lead LNPs. Here we delivered sgRNAs
   targeting the inflammation-related gene ICAM-2. However, the long-term
   utility of FIND will be defined by its ability to identify
   nanoparticles for in vivo gene editing more efficiently than the
   current gold standard, which is in vitro screening. Relatedly, to fully
   utilize the large in vivo datasets generated by FIND, efforts will need
   to be made to develop high-throughput ways of characterizing LNP
   characterizations zeta-potential, pK[a], and lipid bilayer structure.
   We believe that, in time, these advances will help position FIND to
   help facilitate the discovery of structure–activity relationships to
   nonliver tissues. In future studies, it will also be important to
   further improve the efficiency of gene editing in endothelial cells
   beyond 20%.

   We did not observe noticeable experimental variability within a given
   FIND screening experiment. We quantified the consistency of the
   sequencing readouts by analyzing the normalized DNA delivery values
   between bioreplicates. In all cell types, in each of the three screens,
   there were no overt differences between bioreplicates, suggesting the
   precision of the sequencing was high (SI Appendix, Fig. S6). In
   individual LNP testing, we did observe variability in hepatocyte
   delivery when 7C3 was administered over several batches to a total of
   34 mice. Notably, delivery to splenic ECs was consistent, as was the
   (lack of) delivery to all other tested cell types. We were unable to
   identify the chemical variations that led to batch variability in
   hepatocyte targeting. Two possibilities that will require further
   investigation include variable LNP chemical structure and variable mRNA
   activity. Performing FIND screens with well-defined compounds could
   minimize batch-to-batch variability.

   We note that when testing many new LNPs batch variability may be
   observed since the formulations are not yet optimized. However, this
   issue is not related to FIND or to pooled LNP screens; it is just as
   likely to occur when LNPs are tested individually. We believe FIND may
   actually minimize unwanted error in two ways. First, Cre-based
   reporters quantify delivery at the level of cell type. Identifying the
   cell type with batch issues is much easier than with two common
   approaches used in the field today: mRNA encoding luciferase or
   erythropoietin, which quantifies protein production at the tissue- and
   organism-level, respectively. Second, when nanoparticles are screened
   individually, missed injections, small changes in time points, mouse
   age, and other variables can introduce “silent” experimental
   variability that affects how LNP1 performs, relative to LNP2. Here, we
   inject all of the nanoparticles into the same mouse, which helps to
   reduce these sources of unintentional experimental variance. At the
   same time, FIND has several important limitations. LNPs must be stable
   and must be well-tolerated. Like all DNA-based screens, it is
   imperative to prevent DNA contamination.

   Finally, we note that the doses of mRNA or gene editing constructs that
   are well-tolerated after systemic administration to patients has not
   yet been established. In one related example, the FDA approved ONPATTRO
   therapeutic, which is an siRNA systemically administered in an LNP, at
   a dose of 0.3 mg/kg. This may provide an initial estimate of the mRNA
   doses that are tolerated in the clinic. However, Cas9 mRNA is >100
   times larger than a single siRNA duplex (∼4,500-nt ssRNA vs. 21-nt
   dsRNA). As a result, there is still a need to further improve the
   potency of the drug delivery systems as well as the mRNA drugs to
   advance novel Cas9 therapies into the clinic. Despite these caveats,
   FIND is a robust method to quantify how hundreds of LNPs deliver mRNA
   to any combination of cell types in vivo. We believe FIND is
   well-positioned to help identify LNPs with novel tropisms, which could
   lead to improved nonliver RNA drugs.

Materials and Methods

Nanoparticle Formulation.

   Nanoparticles were formulated using a microfluidic device as previously
   described (26). Briefly, nucleic acids (mRNA, DNA barcodes, siRNA, and
   sgRNA) were diluted in 10 mM citrate buffer (Teknova) while lipid-amine
   compounds, alkyl-tailed PEG, cholesterol, and helper lipids were
   diluted in ethanol. For nanoparticle screens, Cre mRNA and DNA barcodes
   were mixed at a 10:1 mass ratio. Citrate and ethanol phases were
   combined in a microfluidic device by syringes (Hamilton Company) at a
   flow rate of 600 µL/min and 200 µL/min, respectively. All PEGs,
   cholesterol, and helper lipids were purchased from Avanti Lipids.

DNA Barcoding.

   Each chemically distinct LNP was formulated to carry its own unique DNA
   barcode (Fig. 1). For example, LNP1 carried DNA barcode 1, while the
   chemically distinct LNP2 carried DNA barcode 2. DNA barcodes were
   designed rationally with several characteristics, as we previously
   described (20). Fifty-six- nucleotide-long ssDNA sequences were
   purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. The two nucleotides on the
   5′ and 3′ ends of the 56-nt ssDNA were modified with phosphorothioates
   to reduce exonuclease degradation and improve DNA barcode stability. To
   ensure equal amplification of each sequence, we included universal
   forward and reverse primer regions on all barcodes. To monitor for PCR
   bias, each barcode was also designed with seven random nucleotides.
   Each barcode was distinguished using a unique 8-bp sequence. An 8-bp
   sequence can generate over 4^8 (65,536) distinct barcodes. We used 240
   distinct 8-bp sequences designed by to prevent sequence bleaching on
   the Illumina MiniSeq sequencing machine.

Nanoparticle Characterization.

   LNP hydrodynamic diameter was measured using high-throughput DLS
   (DynaPro Plate Reader II; Wyatt). LNPs were diluted in sterile 1× PBS
   to a concentration of ∼0.06 μg/mL and analyzed. To avoid using unstable
   LNPs, and to enable sterile purification using a 0.22-μm filter, LNPs
   were included only if they met three criteria: diameter >20 nm,
   diameter <200 nm, and correlation function with one inflection point.
   Particles that met these criteria were dialyzed with 1× PBS
   (Invitrogen) and were sterile-filtered with a 0.22-μm filter.

Cell Culture.

   In vitro experiments were performed using HEK.293 cells (GenTarget)
   stably transduced with a CMV-lox-GFP-stop-lox-RFP construct cultured in
   DMEM/F-12 50/50 media (Corning) supplemented by 10% (vol/vol) FBS (VWR)
   and 1% (vol/vol) penicillin–streptomycin (VWR). Cells were seeded in a
   six-well plate at a density of 300,000 cells per well; 24 h later, LNPs
   were added with a total mRNA dose of 100 ng. Six hours after
   transfection, media was refreshed. DNA was isolated using 50 μL of
   QuickExtract (EpiCentre).

Endocytosis Inhibition.

   For experiments shown in Fig. 1 and SI Appendix, Fig. S3 E–H, cells
   were incubated with endocytosis inhibitors. Specifically, 1 h before
   incubation with pooled LNPs, inhibitors of clathrin-mediated
   endocytosis (chlorpromazine, 100 μM; Alfa Aesar), caveolae-mediated
   endocytosis (genistein, 100μM; TCI America), and macropinocytosis
   [5-(N-Ethyl-N-isopropyl) Amiloride, EIPA, 50 μM; Toronto Research
   Chemicals] were added to cells.

Animal Experiments.

   All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the Georgia
   Institute of Technology’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
   LSL-Tomato (007914), C57BL/6J (000664), and constitutive SpCas9
   (026179) mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory and used
   between 5–12 wk of age. In all experiments, we used n = 3–5 mice per
   group. Mice were injected i.v. via the lateral tail vein or
   intramuscularly into the quadriceps, tibialis anterior, and
   gastrocnemius. The nanoparticle concentration was determined using
   NanoDrop (Thermo Scientific). For in vivo nanoparticle screens, mice
   were administered 1.5 mg/kg for intravascular and 1 mg/kg for
   intramuscular administration. The dosing schedule for each experiment
   is shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S7.

Cell Isolation and Staining.

   Cells were isolated 72 h after injection with LNPs unless otherwise
   noted. Mice were perfused with 20 mL of 1× PBS through the right
   atrium. Tissues were finely cut and then placed in a digestive enzyme
   solution with collagenase type I (Sigma-Aldrich), collagenase XI
   (Sigma-Aldrich), and hyaluronidase (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37 °C at 550 rpm
   for 45 min. The digestive enzyme for heart and spleen included
   collagenase IV (32, 37, 45). Cell suspension was filtered through 70-μm
   mesh and red blood cells were lysed. Cells were stained to identify
   specific cell populations and sorted using the BD FacsFusion and BD
   Facs Aria IIIu cell sorters in the Georgia Institute of Technology
   Cellular Analysis Core. For in vitro experiments, BD Accuri C6 and BD
   FacsFusion were used. The antibody clones used were anti-CD31 (390;
   BioLegend), anti-CD45.2 (104; BioLegend), and anti-CD102 (3C4;
   BioLegend). PE anti-mCD47 (miap301; BioLegend) was used for tdTomato
   compensation. Representative flow gates are located in SI Appendix,
   Fig. S8. PBS-injected Ai14 mice were used to gate tdTomato populations
   for i.v. administration, while contralateral limbs were used to gate
   for intramuscular experiments.

Biodistribution.

   LNPs encapsulating Cy5.5-tagged DNA barcode were administered at 0.75
   mg/kg. After 3 h, tissues were isolated without perfusion, weighed
   individually, and imaged using the Licor Odyssey CLx imaging system.
   Signal intensity was normalized to tissue weight.

Endothelial RNA interference.

   C57BL/6J mice were injected with 7C2 and 7C3 with PBS, 2 mg/kg siCTRL
   (siGFP-647) (AxoLabs), or 1 mg/kg siICAM2 (AxoLabs). In all cases,
   siRNAs were chemically modified at the 2′ position to increase
   stability and negate immunostimulation. Both siGFP and siICAM2
   sequences have been previously reported several times (32, 37, 45).
   Seventy-two hours after injection, tissues were isolated and protein
   expression was determined via flow cytometry. ICAM2 MFI in PBS-treated
   mice was normalized to 100%, and all treated groups were compared with
   this control group.

Endothelial Gene Editing.

   Mice constitutively expressing SpCas9 were injected three times with
   7C2 or 7C3 carrying 1.5 mg/kg of two chemically modified sgRNAs with
   thee nucleotides modified on the 5′ and 5′ ends (TriLink
   Biotechnologies) targeting ICAM2 (sgICAM2ab) (1:1 mass ratio).
   Separately, C57BL/6J mice were injected two times with 2 mg/kg with 7C2
   and 7C3 formulated to carry both SpCas9 mRNA (L-7206; Trilink
   Biotechnology) and sgICAM2ab at a 3:1 mass ratio. Five days after the
   last injection, tissues were isolated, and ICAM2 protein expression was
   measured concurrently while ∼20,000 cells were sorted into
   QuickExtract. Next, C57BL/6J mice were injected two times with 2 mg/kg
   with 7C3 formulated to carry both SpCas9 mRNA (L-7206; Trilink
   Biotechnology) and e-sgICAM2 (AxoLabs) at a 1:1, 3:1, and 5:1 mass
   ratio. Five days after the last injection, tissues were isolated, and
   ICAM2 protein expression was measured concurrently while ∼20,000 cells
   were sorted into QuickExtract. Indel formation was measured by TIDE
   (https://www.deskgen.com/landing/tide.html).

Tissue Immunostaining.

   Excised organs were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron
   Microscopy Systems) in PBS. Tissues were washed twice in PBS and
   cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in PBS until the organs sank to the bottom
   of the container. Organs were then embedded in optimal cutting
   temperature compound (Tissue-Tek) and cryosectioned (10 μm) onto
   slides. Antigen retrieval was performed on slides for 10 min in a
   pressure cooker using low-pH antigen-retrieval solution (Life
   Technologies). Sections were then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100
   (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 10 min at room temperature (RT) before being
   blocked for nonspecific binding with 5% donkey serum (Sigma-Aldrich) in
   PBS for 1 h at RT. Sections were incubated with anti-VE cadherin (BV13;
   Biolegend), diluted to 0.5 μg/mL in PBS, overnight at 4 °C. After three
   washes with PBS, sections were incubated at RT with Alexa Flour 647
   conjugated donkey anti-rat (Thermo Fisher) diluted in PBS for 2 h.
   After two PBS washes, nuclei were stained with DAPI (Life
   Technologies), and coverslips were mounted using Prolong Gold (Life
   Technologies).

Microscopy.

   Images were acquired with a Hamamatsu Flash 4.0 v2 sCMOS camera on a
   PerkinElmer UltraView spinning disk confocal microscope mounted to a
   Zeiss Axiovert 200M body. Single-cell images were acquired using
   Volocity (PerkinElmer) with Z-stacks taken in 0.2-μm increments with a
   63× N.A. 1.4 plan-apochromat objective. Stitched images were acquired
   using a 20× N.A. 0.8 objective with an automated XY stage (ASI)
   controlled by Volocity and set to 20% overlap. All images were linearly
   contrast enhanced.

PCR Amplification.

   All samples were amplified and prepared for sequencing using a one-step
   PCR protocol as previously described (20). More specifically, 1 μL of
   primers (5 μM for final reverse/forward, 0.5 μM for base forward) were
   added to 5 μL of Kapa HiFi 2× master mix, and 4 μL template DNA/water.
   The reaction was run for 30 cycles. When the PCR did not produce clear
   bands, the primer concentrations, DNA template input, PCR temperature,
   and number of cycles were optimized for individual samples.

Deep Sequencing.

   Illumina deep sequencing was conducted in Georgia Institute of
   Technology’s Molecular Evolution core. Runs were performed on an
   Illumina Miniseq. Primers were designed based on Nextera XT adapter
   sequences.

Data Normalization.

   Counts for each particle, per tissue, were normalized to the barcoded
   LNP mixture we injected into the mouse. This “input” DNA provided the
   DNA counts and was used to normalize DNA counts from the cells and
   tissues.

Data Analysis and Statistics.

   Sequencing results were processed using a custom Python-based tool to
   extract raw barcode counts for each tissue. These raw counts were then
   normalized with an R script prior for further analysis. Statistical
   analysis was done using GraphPad Prism 7; more specifically, one-tailed
   t test or one-way ANOVAs were used where appropriate. Data are plotted
   as mean ± SEM unless otherwise stated.

Significance

   Jawless, boneless, and virtually without fossil record, hagfish have
   long escaped systematists’ grip on their place among other fish. Yet
   their systematic resolution is critical to define vertebrates as a
   clade. Here we report an unequivocal fossil hagfish from the Cretaceous
   Mediterranean. Using this fossil to calibrate the evolutionary history
   of the group, our analysis supports hagfish and lampreys as sister
   groups, which likely diverged from one another in early Paleozoic
   times. As a result, vertebrates have a deep dichotomy, where some
   fossil jawless vertebrates sit closer to hagfish and lampreys than to
   jawed vertebrates. We showed that morphology-based analysis converged
   onto molecular inferences when characters are coded nonindependently,
   providing a case study for morphological–molecular conflicts in animal
   phylogeny.

Abstract

   Hagfish depart so much from other fishes anatomically that they were
   sometimes considered not fully vertebrate. They may represent: (i) an
   anatomically primitive outgroup of vertebrates (the morphology-based
   craniate hypothesis); or (ii) an anatomically degenerate vertebrate
   lineage sister to lampreys (the molecular-based cyclostome hypothesis).
   This systematic conundrum has become a prominent case of conflict
   between morphology- and molecular-based phylogenies. To date, the
   fossil record has offered few insights to this long-branch problem or
   the evolutionary history of hagfish in general, because unequivocal
   fossil members of the group are unknown. Here, we report an unequivocal
   fossil hagfish from the early Late Cretaceous of Lebanon. The soft
   tissue anatomy includes key attributes of living hagfish: cartilages of
   barbels, postcranial position of branchial apparatus, and chemical
   traces of slime glands. This indicates that the suite of characters
   unique to living hagfish appeared well before Cretaceous times. This
   new hagfish prompted a reevaluation of morphological characters for
   interrelationships among jawless vertebrates. By addressing
   nonindependence of characters, our phylogenetic analyses recovered
   hagfish and lampreys in a clade of cyclostomes (congruent with the
   cyclostome hypothesis) using only morphological data. This new
   phylogeny places the fossil taxon within the hagfish crown group, and
   resolved other putative fossil cyclostomes to the stem of either
   hagfish or lamprey crown groups. These results potentially resolve the
   morphological–molecular conflict at the base of the Vertebrata. Thus,
   assessment of character nonindependence may help reconcile
   morphological and molecular inferences for other major discords in
   animal phylogeny.

   Hagfish and lampreys (cyclostomes) represent the only living lineages
   of jawless vertebrates (or agnathans) (1). Cyclostomes are generally
   considered primitive morphologically with respect to jawed vertebrates
   (gnathostomes) (1, 2). However, consensus is still lacking about
   cyclostome relationships. None of the traits proposed to unite hagfish
   and lampreys sets them apart clearly from extinct lineages of jawless
   vertebrates (3, 4). Furthermore, characters distribute asymmetrically.
   Hagfish have fewer traits than lampreys in common with gnathostomes,
   and are characterized by rudimentary state or absence of otherwise
   pan-vertebrate traits such as electroreceptors or taste buds (5, 6).
   Thus, resolving the cyclostome relationships holds direct implications
   for defining the vertebrate crown group, and for describing early
   character evolution in that clade. Motivated by this prospect, a number
   of analyses have set out to clarify positions of hagfish and lampreys
   with respect to gnathostomes.

   The endeavor has generated variants of four main topological schemes
   (Fig. 1 A–D). Early classifications split vertebrates between agnathans
   and gnathostomes, with cyclostomes nested within the former (Fig. 1A)
   (7). With the advent of cladistics, this dichotomy was challenged:
   hagfish fell outside the vertebrate node, rendering cyclostomes
   paraphyletic (craniate hypothesis; Fig. 1B) (8). More recent analyses
   of morphological data continue to support the paraphyly, but differ
   from the earlier analyses in placing fossil agnathans on the
   gnathostome stem (Fig. 1D) (9⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓⇓–16). Meanwhile, cyclostome
   paraphyly has been contested by molecular phylogenetics, which nearly
   unanimously favor cyclostomes as a clade (cyclostome hypothesis; Fig.
   1C) (17, 18). Thus, the controversy has been locked in a stalemate
   between the molecular inferences for cyclostome monophyly (Fig. 1C) and
   the morphologically supported cyclostome paraphyly (Fig. 1D).

   A summary of hypotheses for cyclostome relationships. The hypotheses
   differ in cyclostome monophyly or paraphyly (columns), and about
   relationships of fossil “agnathans” with respect to the cyclostome and
   gnathostome crowns (rows). Blue box = support from morphological data;
   red box = support from molecular data. Yellow box = compatible with
   both data types. (A) Noncladistic classification schemes based on
   morphological data with cyclostomes nested among agnathans. (B)
   Craniate hypothesis in early cladistic analyses based on morphological
   data, where hagfish and fossil agnathans become nested outside the
   crown vertebrate node. (C) Cyclostome hypothesis as supported by
   molecular data. Fossil agnathans are assumed on the gnathostome stem.
   (D) Craniate hypothesis in recent analyses of morphological data, where
   hagfish remain nested outside the crown vertebrate node. Fossil
   agnathans are placed on the gnathostome stem. (E) Updated cyclostome
   hypothesis supported by the analyses of morphological data presented in
   this paper. Hagfish and lampreys form a clade of cyclostomes as
   supported by the molecular inferences. However, some fossil agnathans
   are closer to the cyclostome crown than to the gnathostome crown.

   Despite the ever more complete molecular datasets, consensus has not
   been achieved. This is because (i) monophyly is an anticipated outcome
   of long-branch attraction in molecular data; and (ii) fossil taxa that
   potentially break up the long branches are only accessible via
   morphological data. Interpretations of character polarities are
   radically different between the two topologies. The
   morphology-supported paraphyly implies rudimentary state or absence of
   traits in hagfish as primitive (8). For the monophyly, molecular trees
   are agnostic about character polarities, but the rudiments and absence
   in hagfish tend to be interpreted as secondary (2, 3). An equally
   parsimonious alternative— hagfish as primitive and lampreys and
   gnathostomes as convergent—is rarely discussed (2). As such, cyclostome
   relationships provide a classic example of long-branch problems
   hindering morphological–molecular congruence.

   Although fossils are critical in reducing branch lengths, the patchy
   fossil record of cyclostomes remains a formidable challenge. For
   hagfish (myxinoids), three soft-bodied Carboniferous forms
   (Gilpichthys, Myxineidus, and Myxinikela) have each been posited as a
   stem myxinoid (19⇓–21), but myxinoid affinities for the former two have
   been questioned (9, 22, 23). Myxinikela is the sole putative myxinoid
   with any degree of cladistic support (9), but its similarities to
   living hagfish may partly be artifacts of preservation (23). As these
   Carboniferous forms are only preserved with a handful of morphological
   structures, the inferences have been based on a few myxinoid- or
   cyclostome-diagnostic characters (potential keratinous teeth in
   Gilpichthys; a longitudinally elongate nasohypophyseal system in
   Myxinikela) and the general absence of lamprey-like traits (e.g., oral
   funnel, discrete dorsal fins) (19⇓–21). Consequently, living hagfishes
   imply long ghost lineages, making it difficult to interpret the
   peculiar morphology of the group. Here, we report an unequivocal
   hagfish fossil from the Late Cretaceous of Lebanon—which reduces this
   gap in the fossil record by 100 My—and present an updated
   morphology-based phylogeny of cyclostomes. We also describe the
   exquisitely preserved soft-tissue anatomy of this new hagfish using
   trace elements mapped by synchrotron rapid-scanning X-ray fluorescence
   (SRS-XRF; described in Methods and SI Appendix, Part B).

Etymology.

   The generic name is derived from “Tethys” after the Tethys Sea and
   “myxinos” (Latinized Greek for “slimy fish”). The specific name is
   derived from “tapirus” (Latinized Old Tupi for tapir) and “rostrum” (a
   Latin root for snout) for the elongated tapering snout.

Horizon and Locality.

   The type specimen was collected from sublithographic limestones of
   Hâdjula Lagerstätte (Cenomanian, Upper Cretaceous), 10 km east of
   Byblos, Lebanon. The locality is interpreted as an interreef basin on a
   carbonate platform (24). See SI Appendix, Part A for detailed
   information on provenance and geological settings.

Diagnosis.

   Tethymyxine tapirostrum is a myxinoid exhibiting the following unique
   combination of characters: tapering nasohypophyseal profile; tentacular
   cartilage not extending beyond nasohypophyseal aperture; prebranchial
   length nearly equal to branchial length; 8 pairs of branchial pouches;
   133 slime glands on one side; and caudal fin not expanded into a round
   lobe.

Description and Comparisons.

   In visible light, BHI 6445 (Fig. 2) is preserved in full-body outline
   with soft tissues (body length = 313 mm). The trunk lies on its left
   side, whereas the head was twisted counterclockwise to expose the
   ventral side. The preserved tissues are marked by greater abundance of
   P, Mn, Fe, Cu, and Zn relative to the surrounding matrix (Fig. 2C and
   SI Appendix, Fig. S3). These tissues are inferred to be (i) composed of
   collagenous extracellular matrix (e.g., chondrocranium); (ii) enclosed
   by a highly vascularized epithelial sheet (e.g., branchial pouches,
   livers); or (iii) secreted keratin (e.g., infillings of slime glands,
   tooth-like apparatus). The original outline of the body is clearly
   demarcated from the matrix in most elements mapped by SRS-XRF (Fig. 2C
   and SI Appendix, Fig. S3). Al, P, S, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, and As are
   markedly more abundant in the preserved tissues than in the matrix,
   whereas the reverse is true for Si, Ca, and Hg. The preservation of
   structures and imprints is partly obscured by glue and paint, but the
   fossilized tissues can be distinguished from artifacts. Optically, the
   structural preservation is distinguished by surface topography under
   the artifacts. In SRS-XRF, the artifacts are clearly differentiated
   from the fossil and matrix based on distributions of S, Ti, V, and Fe.
   In particular, X-ray absorption spectroscopy reveals differential
   distributions of sulfur species in this specimen (SI Appendix, Fig.
   S4). Sulfate is the dominant species in all residues; organic sulfur is
   present in both the fossil and matrix, but virtually absent in the glue
   (SI Appendix, Part B). This result highlights the utility of SRS-XRF in
   identifying curatorial artifacts in fossil specimens.

   The preservation of decay-prone soft tissues such as branchial pouches
   and slime (Fig. 2) suggests that BHI 6445 was rapidly buried (25).
   Although the mode of preservation is similar to that of the Early
   Cretaceous freshwater lamprey Mesomyzon from the Jehol Group of China,
   internal structures of BHI 6445 are not obscured by the preserved
   integument and muscles as in specimens of Mesomyzon (26) (for detailed
   discussion, see SI Appendix, Part A).

   The overall characteristics clearly reject nonmyxinoid hypotheses for
   the identity of BHI 6445. The absence of a mineralized skeleton, paired
   fins, and jaws rules out anguilliform gnathostomes like the coeval eel
   Luenchelys (27). BHI 6445 is not a lamprey either, because it does not
   have an oral sucker, tectal cartilages, branchial basket, dorsal fins,
   and other skeletal and proportional features of lampreys that would
   have been present given the state of preservation (25). Instead, BHI
   6445 has characters diagnostic of myxinoids, including an elongate
   nasohypophyseal portion of the chondrocranium, posteriorly placed
   branchial pouches, and slime glands.

   Tethymyxine has a small head relative to its body size. The
   prebranchial length of BHI 6445 is shorter than that in living
   hagfishes, relative to the total body length (13% versus 20–30%) (28).
   As a consequence, the first branchial pouch sits more anteriorly than
   in living hagfish species, leaving a relatively short space for the
   lingual apparatus to occupy. The snout tapers toward the
   nasohypophyseal aperture (nostril). The nasohypophyseal barbels are
   preserved with the sigmoidal tentacular cartilage on the left side of
   BHI 6445. The barbels sit behind the aperture as in living Rubicundus
   (29) (Fig. 3 B and C), but the specimen differs from it in lacking a
   protruded nasohypophyseal tube. The tentacular cartilage is fused
   posteriorly with the lateral element of the anterior lingual
   cartilages. Both the left and right parts of the keratinous tooth
   plates are preserved in association with the anterior lingual
   cartilages. Although several cusps can be identified by the
   distributions of Ca, Mn, Fe, Ni, and Hg (SI Appendix, Fig. S3), precise
   cusp number and shape cannot be determined. Unlike the preservation of
   comb-like tooth plates in Gilpichthys from Mazon Creek (20), the plates
   may have been pyrolysated in BHI 6445 as seen in the scales of
   actinopterygians from the same locality (27). Presumably the missing
   counterpart of BHI 6445 has the rest of preserved chondrocranial
   elements.

   showing cyclostome relationships. Maximum parsimony and Bayesian
   inferences converged onto each other in placing Tethymyxine within the
   hagfish crown group and supporting cyclostome monophyly. The precise
   topology is from the maximum parsimony analysis (SI Appendix, Fig. S6).
   Node ages represent median of 95% HPD distribution in a Bayesian
   molecular clock analysis of mitogenomic sequences (16S and COI) under
   fossilized birth–death model (see SI Appendix, Fig. S9 for a fully
   calibrated maximum clade credibility tree with node intervals). The
   crown group of cyclostomes is united by at least two morphological
   characters (shown on each stem): keratinous tooth plates (yellow) and
   periocular position of trunk muscles (red). At Top Right, the
   nasohypophyseal profiles are compared in ventral view among three
   selected crown-group hagfishes (B: Tethymyxine tapirostrum; C,
   Rubicundus eos; D, Eptatretus stoutii; the latter two based on ref.
   29). To show morphological divergence among the three major crown
   groups of living vertebrates (E, myxinoids; F, petromyzontiforms; G,
   gnathostomes), each is accompanied by a chondrocranium in left lateral
   view (green: neural crest-derived nasohypophyseal skeleton; red:

   Tethymyxine has eight pairs of branchial pouches. This number is
   greater than in Rubicundus spp. (n = 5) and most other living hagfishes
   (n = 4∼7), equal to some species of Eptatretus and Nemamyxyne, and
   smaller than in some species of Eptatretus (n = 14 in E. polytrema)
   (28). A structure immediately behind the branchial series is
   topographically and morphologically consistent with a heart, which has
   Fe in higher abundance than in the surrounding tissues (Fig. 2 D and
   E). The intestine extends between the anterior and posterior liver
   lobes. These visceral tissues have different textures and colors that
   allow clear delineation under natural light (SI Appendix, Fig. S2).
   However, the element mapping by SRS-XRF shows similar compositions
   among these tissues. P, S, and Cl appear to have greater abundances in
   the branchial pouches than in the intestine, and Ca seems to be the
   reverse (SI Appendix, Fig. S3).

   A characteristic unique to hagfish, slime glands are preserved in an
   uninterrupted series of infillings that extends nearly the entire
   length of the body on the ventral side. The infillings are
   distinguished from other tissues by surface profile, high Ca, P, and S
   abundances, and higher levels of Cl, Ti, Mn, Fe, Cu, Ni, Zn, and Hg
   relative to the matrix (Fig. 2 and SI Appendix, Figs. S2 and S3 and
   Table S1). The chemical mapping is consistent with the fact that a
   major component of hagfish slime is tightly coiled, mucin-coated
   α-keratin threads (30)—pyrolysates of which are characterized by
   calcium phosphatic content (31). The number of the slime glands (n =
   133 on the right) is greater than in most living hagfishes (n =
   70∼110), but close to that of R. eos (n = 128∼130) (28). The end of the
   tail is obscured by paint, but it is possible to outline the body by
   relatively high concentrations of Cu, P, S, and Fe (contained in paint,
   but higher in preserved tissues) and relatively low concentrations of
   Ca (Fig. 2C and SI Appendix, Figs. S3 and S4 and Table S1). The
   notochord is difficult to identify optically (as it is generally in
   fossils of soft-bodied vertebrates), but can be delineated with the
   high P and S concentrations along the dorsal midline (SI Appendix,
   Figs. S3 and S4 B and C). The tail tapers rather than expanding into a
   round lobe.

Phylogenetics.

   We generated a morphological dataset to test the relationships of
   Tethymyxine and cyclostomes. Tethymyxine has myxinoid apomorphies not
   identified in other fossil taxa. These traits include the posteriorly
   placed branchial series and slime glands, which are absent, missing, or
   ambiguous in Myxinikela and other putative fossil cyclostomes (9). To
   code these unequivocal and potential myxinoids in a phylogenetic
   dataset, we reevaluated morphological characters that are
   nonindependent, and enhanced contingency coding to reduce implicit
   weighting (32). For example, attributes of a mineralized skeleton such
   as bones and scales are not simply absent in the soft-bodied myxinoids.
   Those characters are inapplicable in this lineage. Applying no
   character values to attributes of biomineralization in myxinoids
   removes additive weight of lacking mineralization in every coded
   skeletal element. This contingency coding eliminated, on average, 70%
   of character information from nonvertebrate outgroups and 32% from
   cyclostomes, which would otherwise be available to coding (SI Appendix,
   Parts B–D and Fig. S5 for comparative analysis).

   Searches of this dataset, using both maximum parsimony and Bayesian
   methods, resolved Tethymyxine within the myxinoid crown group, sister
   to species of the living genus Rubicundus (Fig. 3A and SI Appendix,
   Figs. S6–S8). These two genera with an elongate snout, indented
   barbels, and a large number of slime glands (>100) (Fig. 3 B and C)
   were nested outside the clade of more conventional living myxinoids
   (Eptatretus, Myxine, and Neomyxine) (Fig. 3D). Myxinikela was resolved
   as a stem myxinoid, whereas other Carboniferous forms (Gilpichthys,
   Hardistiella, Mayomyzon, and Myxineidus) and Priscomyzon were found
   along the stem of lampreys. Under maximum parsimony, the crown group of
   cyclostomes is united by two unambiguous character changes: keratinous
   tooth plates and migration of postotic myomeres to position of eyes
   (Fig. 3A and SI Appendix, Table S3). Euconodonts, Pipiscius, and
   anaspids fell into the cyclostome stem. Together, these lineages
   comprised the total group of cyclostomes. Controversial Cambrian forms
   (Haikouella, Haikouichthys, Metaspriggina, and Myllokunmingia) were
   resolved in the vertebrate stem.

   Given the topology obtained in the maximum parsimony analysis, and
   using the fossil-calibrated dataset of mitogenomic sequences, tip-dated
   Bayesian estimates of divergence placed the crown cyclostome node from
   the earliest Cambrian (Terreneuvian) to Early Silurian (Wenlockian)
   times [95% highest posterior density interval (HPD): 536.31–428.44 Mya]
   with median near the Cambrian–Ordovician boundary (485.57 Mya) (SI
   Appendix, Fig. S9). Both the myxinoid and petromyzontiform crowns were
   estimated to have their origins in Mesozoic times, with the myxinoid
   estimates straddling the Jurassic–Cretaceous boundary (95% HPD:
   183.95–103.30 Mya; median: 138.59 Mya) and with the petromyzontiform
   estimates within the Jurassic times (95% HPD: 194.84–163.14 Mya;
   median: 169.82 Mya).

Discussion

   Tethymyxine is significant as being the sole fossil of the crown group
   Myxinoidea. It therefore provides a crucial calibration point for the
   evolution of the myxinoid clade as well as the distinctive morphology
   of the group. In our dataset, the myxinoid topologies were robust to
   altered character coding schemes (assuming taphonomic artifacts) or
   different taxonomic combinations (SI Appendix, Part C and Fig. S8).
   Multiple traits of the myxinoid crown in Tethymyxine are lacking in the
   Carboniferous stem myxinoid Myxinikela. In Myxinikela, the branchial
   apparatus sits well within the cranial domain, and the liver appears to
   be a single lobe. Given its state of preservation, α-keratin in the
   slime glands would have been preserved if present in Myxinikela. Thus,
   these crown myxinoid traits were likely acquired along the remaining
   200–250 My ghost lineage (Fig. 3A).

   Our analyses reveal cyclostomes as a clade using morphological data.
   Both maximum parsimony and Bayesian analyses converged on this result
   with the same clade membership (SI Appendix, Figs. S6 and S7). The
   dataset performed consistently with theoretical predictions (33).
   Maximum parsimony and Bayesian inferences generated trees that are
   largely congruent with each other. The maximum parsimony trees are
   better resolved (more precise) than the Bayesian trees. Importantly,
   cyclostome monophyly based on morphology corroborates the topology
   consistently supported by molecular data (17, 18). The
   fossil-calibrated mitogenomic molecular clock (SI Appendix, Fig. S9)
   also produced divergence estimates for cyclostome crown clades that are
   largely congruent with the previous molecular clock analysis of nuclear
   genes (34). For the cyclostome crown, our divergence estimates
   (536.31–428.44 Mya) agree well with the previous estimates (480–430
   Mya). Calibrated with Tethymyxine (100.5–93.9 Mya), the myxinoid crown
   is now pushed to an older interval (183.95–103.30 Mya) than in the
   previous analysis (90–40 Mya). The petromyzontiform crown is estimated
   shallower (194.84–163.14 Mya) than in the analysis of nuclear genes
   (280–220 Mya), but the split between the southern and northern
   hemispheric clades is constrained to before the separation and breakup
   of Gondwana in both analyses (Fig. 3A and SI Appendix, Fig. S9) (34).

   This morphological–molecular congruence is a significant update of the
   cyclostome hypothesis (Fig. 1 C and E). One principal advance is
   phylogenetic resolution of fossil jawless vertebrates under cyclostome
   monophyly. These fossil forms include (i) putative stem taxa of
   cyclostome lineages (e.g., Myxinikela), and (ii) lineages that have
   been placed on the gnathostome stem under cyclostome paraphyly (e.g.,
   anaspids and euconodonts). Molecular datasets contain no information
   from the fossils, but previous schemes of the cyclostome hypothesis
   assumed the taxa within cyclostomes and the taxa on the gnathostome
   stem without including them all in a single cladistic test (18). The
   stem cyclostome status of anaspids and euconodonts has never been
   supported quantitatively in previous analyses (Fig. 3A and SI Appendix,
   Figs. S6 and S8). Furthermore, our Bayesian analysis (i) did not
   resolve the polytomy of several other lineages with cyclostome and
   gnathostome total clades; and (ii) supported euconodonts as stem
   myxinoids (SI Appendix, Fig. S7). These results are reminiscent of
   early classification schemes of cyclostomes (Fig. 1 A and B) and
   precladistic attempts to classify conodonts, but have the basis in
   different characters.

   Our morphological dataset has a long list of characters that support
   cyclostome monophyly and stem cyclostome status of anaspids and
   euconodonts (SI Appendix, Table S3). The crown has two unambiguous
   synapomorphies in keratinous tooth plates and periocular position of
   trunk myomeres (Fig. 3A). The characters posited previously as
   cyclostome synapomorphies (e.g., pulley-like feeding apparatus) (4) are
   either not preserved in fossils [thus optimized to the crown cyclostome
   node only under delayed transformation (DELTRAN)] or symplesiomorphic
   to cyclostomes. In comparison, keratin is decay-resistant relative to
   other soft tissues (25), and myomeric positions can be determined using
   a number of osteological correlates, such as postbranchial wall in
   osteostracans (10). As for euconodonts, their position in the
   cyclostome stem is supported by the lack of anterior extension of the
   midline fin and the presence of denticulate elements within the buccal
   cavity (SI Appendix, Table S3). Recent attempts to associate conodonts
   with cyclostomes (or myxinoids) were based on the inferred presence of
   a pulley-like feeding apparatus (35) or the alleged homology of
   conodont elements with the keratinous tooth plates in living
   cyclostomes (36, 37). Both of these characters were coded as ambiguous
   in euconodonts in our dataset (SI Appendix, Fig. S7). Nevertheless, the
   Bayesian inferences supported the stem-myxinoid position. For
   parsimony, the cyclostome crown collapsed after coding these ambiguous
   characters for conodonts as seen in living cyclostomes (SI Appendix,
   Fig. S8C).

   The morphological support for cyclostome monophyly emerged after
   enhancement of contingency coding method. Nearly all cyclostome
   synapomorphies in our dataset were included in previous morphological
   datasets in various definitions and coding schemes, and would have been
   optimized as cyclostome synapomorphies if the topology were constrained
   (SI Appendix, Table S4). These datasets suggest a number of other
   characters as potentially synapomorphic to cyclostomes under the same
   topological constraint. In our dataset, most of those additional
   characters are symplesiomorphic to cyclostomes (denoted with “§,” SI
   Appendix, Table S4) optimized in opposite character polarity (**), or
   parsimony-uninformative and not included (‡)—all consequences of
   assigning nonapplicable scores within those characters (SI Appendix,
   Parts D and E). Recoding nonapplicable scores to discrete character
   states resurrected paraphyletic cyclostomes (SI Appendix, Fig. S8A).

   Our phylogeny implies hagfish morphology as specialized, not primitive.
   In myxinoids, trait absence or underdeveloped condition has been
   difficult to interpret—whether the absence (e.g., electroreceptors or
   extrinsic eye musculature) represents an ancestral or secondary
   condition, or whether the underdeveloped traits (e.g., vertebrae) are
   rudimentary or vestigial. Hagfish nested within cyclostomes suggest
   that these are derived states. Indeed, a large number of reversal
   events are optimized between the total and crown myxinoid nodes under
   both accelerated transformation (ACCTRAN) and DELTRAN (SI Appendix,
   Table S3). Regarding those listed traits, hagfish appear to have lost
   them secondarily, in line with the narrative of the cyclostome
   hypothesis (5, 38). These character changes are parallel with
   acquisitions of the traits unique to hagfish, such as slime glands (SI
   Appendix, Table S3). Even cyclostomes on the whole appear to be rather
   specialized than primitive. The last common ancestor of all living
   vertebrates has often been posited as a soft-bodied
   hagfish/lamprey-like form (1). However, the stem cyclostome status of
   anaspids and euconodonts in the new phylogeny implies that the
   potential to mineralize skeletal matrix predated the cyclostome crown.
   This scenario is consistent with observations that modern hagfish and
   lampreys deposit calcium phosphates to line their inner ears (39), or
   that lamprey cartilages spontaneously calcify in vitro (40).

Conclusions

   An assessment of nonindependence among morphological characters may
   lead to unexpected congruence when a phylogenetic dispute is locked in
   a stalemate between internally consistent morphological and molecular
   inferences. Our phylogenetic analysis of cyclostomes provides one such
   case study. In this phylogeny of cyclosotmes, the new fossil hagfish
   Tethymyxine represents an important calibration point not just for the
   divergence of the myxinoid crown, but also for many morphological
   traits (e.g., slime glands) that set hagfish apart from all other
   vertebrates. The morphologically supported Cyclostomi implies some of
   the characters conventionally considered primitive in hagfish (e.g.,
   the absence of extraocular muscles, electroreceptors, or taste buds) as
   specialized. This view is consistent with the developmental features of
   hagfish interpreted as vestigial and derived (e.g., axial skeleton)
   (38, 41). Between two living cyclostome lineages, lampreys may serve as
   a better outgroup to gnathostomes, but a full extent of their utility
   as an outgroup remains unknown until evolutionary origins of the
   peculiar life history (distinct larval phase with dramatic
   metamorphosis) are resolved (42, 43).

Methods

   SRS-XRF was performed at beam line 6–2 at the Stanford Synchrotron
   Radiation Lightsource (SSRL), SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory.
   SRS-XRF is a noninvasive technique that can spatially resolve chemical
   element composition in large samples in short time frames (44). For the
   new phylogeny, three lines of analyses were performed: (i) maximum
   parsimony analyses; (ii) nonclock Bayesian analyses; and (iii) clock
   analyses. The morphological dataset was the same for all of the
   analyses and included 52 taxa (SI Appendix, Table S2) and 168
   characters (SI Appendix, Part E). For the parsimony analyses, heuristic
   search was used with no topological constraint. For the non-clock-based
   Bayesian analyses, each analysis was run for 5 million generations with
   2 runs of 4 chains, without topological constraint, and sampling every
   5,000 generations. Finally, we generated a dataset with 16S and COI
   sequences for extant taxa and with fossil calibrations. This dataset
   was subjected to a Bayesian analysis under the fossilized birth–death
   model, given topology obtained from the parsimony analysis. This
   analysis provided divergence estimates shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S9.
   For full description, see SI Appendix, Parts B–E. Original data for
   SRS-XRF and phylogenetic analyses are placed in a permanent depository
   (45).

Significance

   The Pólya–Jensen criterion for the Riemann hypothesis asserts that RH
   is equivalent to the hyperbolicity of certain Jensen polynomials for
   all degrees d≥1 and all shifts n. For each degree d≥1, we confirm this
   criterion for all sufficiently large shifts n. This represents a
   theoretical advance in the field. The method of proof is rooted in the
   newly discovered phenomenon that these polynomials are nicely
   approximated by Hermite polynomials. Furthermore, it is shown that this
   method applies to a large class of related problems.

Abstract

   In 1927, Pólya proved that the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the
   hyperbolicity of Jensen polynomials for the Riemann zeta function ζ(s)
   at its point of symmetry. This hyperbolicity has been proved for
   degrees d≤3. We obtain an asymptotic formula for the central
   derivatives ζ(2n)(1/2) that is accurate to all orders, which allows us
   to prove the hyperbolicity of all but finitely many of the Jensen
   polynomials of each degree. Moreover, we establish hyperbolicity for
   all d≤8. These results follow from a general theorem which models such
   polynomials by Hermite polynomials. In the case of the Riemann zeta
   function, this proves the Gaussian unitary ensemble random matrix model
   prediction in derivative aspect. The general theorem also allows us to
   prove a conjecture of Chen, Jia, and Wang on the partition function.

1. Introduction and Statement of Results

   Expanding on notes of Jensen, Pólya (1) proved that the Riemann
   hypothesis (RH) is equivalent to the hyperbolicity of the Jensen
   polynomials for the Riemann zeta function ζ(s) at its point of
   symmetry. More precisely, he showed that the RH is equivalent to the
   hyperbolicity of all Jensen polynomials associated with the sequence of
   Taylor coefficients {γ(n)} defined
   by−1+4z2 Λ12+z=∑n=0∞γ(n)n!⋅z2n,[1]where Λ(s)=π−s/2Γ(s/2)ζ(s)=Λ(1−s),
   where we say that a polynomial with real coefficients is hyperbolic if
   all of its zeros are real, and where the Jensen polynomial of degree d
   and shift n of an arbitrary sequence {α(0),α(1),α(2),…} of real numbers
   is the polynomialJαd,n(X)≔∑j=0ddjα(n+j)Xj.[2]Thus, the RH is equivalent
   to the hyperbolicity of the polynomials Jγd,n(X) for all nonnegative
   integers d and n (1⇓–3). Since this condition is preserved under
   differentiation, to prove RH, it would be enough to show hyperbolicity
   for the Jγd,0(X).* Due to the difficulty of proving RH, research has
   focused on establishing hyperbolicity for all shifts n for small d.
   Previous to this paper, hyperbolicity was known for d≤3 by work^† of
   Csordas et al. (5) and Dimitrov and Lucas (3).

   Asymptotics for the γ(n) were obtained from Coffey (6) and Pustyl’nikov
   (7). We improve on their results by obtaining an arbitrary precision
   asymptotic formula^‡(Theorem 9), a result that is of independent
   interest. We will use this strengthened result to prove the following
   theorem for all degrees d.

Theorem 1.

   If d≥1, then Jγd,n(X) is hyperbolic for all sufficiently large n.

   An effective proof of Theorem 1 for small d gives the following
   theorem.

Theorem 2.

   If 1≤d≤8, then Jγd,n(X) is hyperbolic for every n≥0.

   Theorem 1 follows from a general phenomenon that Jensen polynomials for
   a wide class of sequences α can be modeled by the Hermite polynomials
   Hd(X), which we define (in a somewhat nonstandard normalization) as the
   orthogonal polynomials for the measure μ(X)=e−X2/4 or more explicitly
   by the generating
   function∑d=0∞Hd(X) tdd! = e−t2+Xt = 1 +X t + (X2−2) t22! + (X3−6X) t33!
    + ⋯ .[3]More precisely, we will prove the following general theorem
   describing the limiting behavior of Jensen polynomials of sequences
   with appropriate growth.

Theorem 3.

   Let {α(n)}, {A(n)}, and {δ(n)} be three sequences of positive real
   numbers with δ(n) tending to zero and
   satisfyinglogα(n+j)α(n)=A(n)j−δ(n)2j2+oδ(n)d as n→∞,[4]for some integer
   d≥1 and all 0≤j≤d. Then, we
   havelimn→∞δ(n)−dα(n) Jαd,nδ(n) X − 1exp(A(n)) = Hd(X),[5]uniformly for
   X in any compact subset of R.

   Since the Hermite polynomials have distinct roots, and since this
   property of a polynomial with real coefficients is invariant under
   small deformation, we immediately deduce the following corollary.

Corollary 4.

   The Jensen polynomials Jαd,n(X) for a sequence α:N→R satisfying the
   conditions in Theorem 3 are hyperbolic for all but finitely many values
   n.

   Theorem 1 is a special case of this corollary. Namely, we shall use
   Theorem 9 to prove that the Taylor coefficients {γ(n)} satisfy the
   required growth conditions in Theorem 3 for every d≥2.

   Theorem 3 in the case of the Riemann zeta function is the derivative
   aspect Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE) random matrix model prediction
   for the zeros of Jensen polynomials. To make this precise, recall that
   Dyson (8), Montgomery (9), and Odlyzko (10) conjecture that the
   nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function are distributed like the
   eigenvalues of random Hermitian matrices. These eigenvalues satisfy
   Wigner’s Semicircular Law, as do the roots of the Hermite polynomials
   Hd(X), when suitably normalized, as d→+∞ (see chapter 3 of ref. 11).
   The roots of Jγd,0(X), as d→+∞, approximate the zeros of Λ12+z (see
   ref. 1 or lemma 2.2 of ref. 12), and so GUE predicts that these roots
   also obey the Semicircular Law. Since the derivatives of Λ12+z are also
   predicted to satisfy GUE, it is natural to consider the limiting
   behavior of Jγd,n(X) as n→+∞. The work here proves that these
   derivative aspect limits are the Hermite polynomials Hd(X), which, as
   mentioned above, satisfy GUE in degree aspect.

   Returning to the general case of sequences with suitable growth
   conditions, Theorem 3 has applications in combinatorics where the
   hyperbolicity of polynomials determines the log-concavity of
   enumerative statistics. For example, see the classic theorem by
   Heilmann and Leib (13), along with works by Chudnovsky and Seymour
   (14), Haglund (15), Haglund et al. (16), Stanley (17), and Wagner (18),
   to name a few. Theorem 3 represents a criterion for establishing the
   hyperbolicity of polynomials in enumerative combinatorics. The theorem
   reduces the problem to determining whether suitable asymptotics hold.
   Here, we were motivated by a conjecture of Chen, Jia, and Wang
   concerning the Jensen polynomials Jpd,n(X), where p(n) is the partition
   function. Nicolas (19) and Desalvo and Pak (20) proved that Jp2,n(X) is
   hyperbolic for n≥25, and, more recently, Chen et al. proved (21) that
   Jp3,n(X) is hyperbolic for n≥94, inspiring them to state as a
   conjecture the following result.

Theorem 5 (Chen–Jia–Wang Conjecture).

   For every integer d≥1, there exists an integer N(d) such that Jpd,n(X)
   is hyperbolic for n≥N(d).

   Table 1 gives the conjectured minimal value for N(d) for d=2j with
   1≤j≤5. More precisely, for each d≤32 it gives the smallest integer such
   that Jpd,n(X) is hyperbolic for N(d) ≤ n ≤ 50,000.

   Conjectured minimal values of N(d)

Remark 6:

   Larson and Wagner (22) have made the proof of Theorem 5 effective by a
   brute-force implementation of Hermite’s criterion (see theorem C of
   ref. 3). They showed that the values in the table are correct for d=4
   and d=5 and that N(d)≤(3d)24d(50d)3d2 in general. The true values are
   presumably much smaller and are probably of only polynomial growth, the
   numbers N(d) in the table being approximately of size 10 d2⁡log⁡d.

   Theorem 5 suggests a natural generalization. As is well known, the
   numbers p(n) are the Fourier coefficients of a modular form,
   namely,1η(τ) = ∑n=0∞ p(n) qn−124 (I(τ)>0, q=e2πiτ),[6]where
   η(τ)=q1/24∏(1−qn) is the Dedekind eta-function. Theorem 5 is then an
   example of a more general theorem about the Jensen polynomials of the
   Fourier coefficients of an arbitrary weakly holomorphic modular form,
   which, for the purposes of this work, will mean a modular form
   (possibly of fractional weight and with multiplier system) with real
   Fourier coefficients on the full modular group SL2(Z) that is
   holomorphic apart from a pole of (possibly fractional) positive order
   at infinity. If f is such a form, we denote its Fourier expansion by^§
   f(τ) = ∑n∈−m+Z≥0af(n) qn (m∈Q>0, af(−m) ≠ 0).[7]Then, we will prove the
   following theorem, which includes Theorem 5.

Theorem 7.

   If f is a weakly holomorphic modular form as above, then for any fixed
   d≥1, the Jensen polynomials Jafd,n(X) are hyperbolic for all
   sufficiently large n.

   Our results are proved by showing that each of the sequences of
   interest to us [the partition function, the Fourier coefficients of
   weakly holomorphic modular forms, and the Taylor coefficients at s=12
   of 4s(1−s)Λ(s)] satisfies the hypotheses of Theorem 3, which we prove
   in Section 2. Actually, in Section 2, we prove a more general result
   (Theorem 8) that gives the limits of suitably normalized Jensen
   polynomials for an even bigger class of sequences having suitable
   asymptotic properties (but without necessarily the corollary about
   hyperbolicity). Theorem 7 giving the hyperbolicity for coefficients of
   modular forms (and hence also for the partition function) is proved in
   Section 3. In Section 4, we prove Theorem 9, which gives an asymptotic
   formula to all orders for the Taylor coefficients of Λ(s) at s=12, and
   in Section 5, we prove Theorems 1 and 2 for the Riemann zeta function
   by using these asymptotics to verify that the hypotheses of Theorem 3
   are fulfilled by the numbers γ(n). We conclude in Section 6 with some
   numerical examples.

2. Proof of Theorem 3

   We deduce Theorem 3 from the following more general result.

Theorem 8.

   Suppose that {E(n)} and {δ(n)} are positive real sequences with δ(n)
   tending to 0, and that F(t)=∑i=0∞citi is a formal power series with
   complex coefficients. For a fixed d≥1, suppose that there are real
   sequences {C0(n)},…,{Cd(n)}, with limn→+∞Ci(n)=ci for 0≤i≤d, such that
   for 0≤j≤d, we
   haveα(n+j)α(n) E(n)−j = ∑i=0d Ci(n) δ(n)iji + oδ(n)d as n→+∞.[8]Then,
   the conclusion of Theorem 3 holds with  exp(A(n))  replaced by E(n) and
   Hd(X) replaced by HF,d(X), where the polynomials HF,m(X)∈C[x] are now
   defined either by the generating function F(−t) eXt=∑HF,m(X) tm/m! or
   in closed form by HF,m(X) ≔ m! ∑k=0m(−1)m−kcm−k Xk/k! .

Proof of Theorems 8 and 3.

   After replacing exp(A(n)) by E(n), the polynomial appearing on the
   left-hand side of [5]
   becomesδ(n)−dα(n) Jαd,nδ(n) X − 1E(n) = ∑k=0ddk δ(n)k−d ∑j=kd (−1)j−k d
   −kj−k α(n+j)α(n)E(n)j Xk.Since 0≤j≤d, and since the error term in [8]
   is o(δ(n)d), we may reorder summation and find that the limiting value
   as n→+∞ of the quantity in square brackets
   satisfieslimn→+∞∑i=0dCi(n) δ(n)k−d+i ∑j=kd(−1)j−k d−kj−k ji = (−1)d−k(d
   −k)! cd−k,because the inner sum, which is the (d−k)th difference of the
   polynomial j↦ji evaluated at j=0, vanishes for i<d−k and equals (d−k)!
   for i=d−k. Theorem 8 follows, and Theorem 3 is just the special case
   E(n)=eA(n) and F(t)=e−t2. □

3. Proof of Theorem 7

   Assume that f is a modular form of (possibly fractional) weight k on
   SL2(Z) (possibly with multiplier system) and with a pole of (possibly
   fractional) order m>0 at infinity and write its Fourier expansion at
   infinity as in [7]. It is standard, either by the circle method of
   Hardy–Ramanujan–Rademacher or by using Poincaré series (for example,
   see ref. 23), that the Fourier coefficients of f have the asymptotic
   formaf(n)=Af nk−12 Ik−1(4πmn)+OnC e2πmn,[9]as n→∞ for some nonzero
   constants Af [an explicit multiple of af(−m)] and C, where Iκ(x)
   denotes the usual I-Bessel function. In view of the expansion of Bessel
   functions at infinity, this implies that af(n) has an asymptotic
   expansion to all orders in 1/n of the
   formaf(n) ∼ e4πmn n2k−34 expc0 + c1n + c2n2 + ⋯,for some constants
   c0, c1, …  depending on f [and in fact only on m and k if we normalize
   the leading coefficient af(−m) of f to be equal to 1]. This gives an
   asymptotic
   expansionlogaf(n+j)af(n) ∼ 4πm ∑i=1∞1/2ijini−12 + 2k−34∑i=1∞(−1)i−1jii 
   ni + ∑i,k≥1ck−kijini+k,[10]valid to all orders in n, and it follows
   that the sequence {af(n)} satisfies the hypotheses of Theorem 3 with
   A(n)=2πm/n+O(1/n) and δ(n)=(π/2)1/2m1/4n−3/4+O(n−5/4). Theorem 7 then
   follows from the corollary to Theorem 3.

4. Asymptotics for Λ(n)(12)

   Previous work of Coffey (6) and Pustyl’nikov (7) offer asymptotics^¶
   for the derivatives Λ(n)12. Here, we follow a slightly different
   approach and obtain effective asymptotics, a result which is of
   independent interest. To describe our asymptotic expansion, we first
   give a formula for these derivatives in terms of an auxiliary function,
   whose asymptotic expansion we shall then determine.

   Following Riemann (cf. chapter 8 of ref. 25), we
   haveΛ(s)=∫0∞ts2−1 θ0(t) dt=1s(s−1)+∫1∞ts2+t1−s2 θ0(t) dtt,where
   θ0(t)=∑k=1∞e−πk2t=12(t−1/2−1)+t−1/2θ0(1/t). It follows
   thatΛ(n)12=− 2n+2 n!+F(n)2n−1,[11]for n>0 (both are of course zero for
   n odd), where F(n) is defined for any real n≥0
   byF(n)=∫1∞(log⁡t)n t−3/4 θ0(t) dt.[12]In particular, if n is a positive
   integer, then the Taylor coefficients γ(n) defined in [1]
   satisfyγ(n)=n!(2n)!⋅82n2Λ(2n−2)12−Λ(2n)12=n!(2n)!⋅ 322n2F(2n−2)−F(2n)22
   n−1.[13]

Theorem 9.

   If n>0, then the function F(n) defined by [12] is given to all orders
   in n by the asymptotic
   expansionF(n) ∼ 2π Ln+1(1+L)n−34L2 eL/4−n/L+3/4 1+b1n+b2n2+⋯ (n→∞),wher
   e L=L(n)≈lognlog⁡n is the unique positive solution of the equation
   n=L(πeL+34) and each coefficient bk belongs to Q(L), the first value
   being b1=2L4+9L3+16L2+6L+224 (L+1)3.

Example 10:

   Here, we illustrate Theorem 9. The two-term
   approximationF(n) ≈ 2π Ln+1(1+L)n−34L2 eL/4−n/L+3/4 1+b1n=:F^(n),is
   sufficiently strong for the proof of Theorem 1. In particular, Theorem
   9 and [13] implyγ^(n)≔n!(2n)!26−2n2n2F^(2n−2)=γ(n)1+O1n2−ε.[14]Here are
   some approximations γ^(n) obtained from this expression by numerically
   computing L using its defining equation above. Table 2 illustrates the
   high precision of this formula.

   Table 2.

   Comparison of γ(n) and γ^(n)

Proof of Theorem 9:

   We approximate the integrand in [12] by f(t)=(log⁡t)nt−3/4e−πt (from
   now on, we consider n as fixed and omit it from the notations). We have
   tddtlog⁡f(t)=nlog⁡t−πt−34, so f(t) assumes its unique maximum at t=a,
   where a=eL is the solution in (1,∞) ofn=πa+34log⁡a.We can then apply
   the usual saddle point method. The Taylor expansion of f(t) around t=a
   is given
   byf(1+λ)af(a)=1+log(1+λ)log⁡an(1+λ)−3/4e−πλa=e−Cλ2/21+A3λ3+A4λ4+⋯,where
   C=(ε+ε2)n−34 (here we have set ε=1log⁡a=L−1) and the Ai (i≥3) are
   polynomials of degree ⌊i/3⌋ in n with coefficients in Q[ε]. This
   expansion is found by expanding log(f((1+λ)a))−log(f(a)) in λ. The
   linear term vanishes by the choice of a, the quadratic term is −Cλ2/2,
   and the coefficients of the higher powers of λ are all linear
   expressions in n with coefficients in Q[ε]. Exponentiating this
   expansion gives the claimed expression for f((1+λ)a)/f(a), where the
   dominant term of each Ai is governed primarily by the exponential of
   the cubic term of the logarithmic expansion. The first few Ai
   areA3=ε3+ε22+ε33 n−14, A4=−ε4+11ε224+ε32+ε44 n+316,A5=ε5+5ε212+7ε312+ε4
   2+ε55 n − 320,A6=ε218+ε36+17ε472+ε56+ε618 n2 − ε4+91ε2180+17ε324+17ε424
   +ε52+ε66 n+532.Plugging in t=(1+λ)a immediately gives the asymptotic
   expansion∫1∞f(t) dt=a f(a) ∫−1+1/a∞e−Cλ2/21+A3λ3+A4λ4+⋯ dλ=a f(a) 2πC 1
   +3A4C2+15A6C3+⋯+(2i−1)!!A2iCi+⋯.(Here, only the part of the integral
   with Cλ2<B⁡log⁡n, where B is any function of n going to infinity as n
   does, contributes.) This equality and the expression in Theorem 9 are
   interpreted as asymptotic expansions. Although these series themselves
   may not converge for a fixed n, we may truncate the resulting
   approximation at O(n−A) for some A>0, and as n→+∞, this approximation
   becomes true to the specified precision. Substituting into this
   expansion the formulas for C and Ai in terms of n, we obtain the
   statement of the theorem with F(n) replaced by the integral over f(t),
   with only A2i (i≤3k) contributing to bk. But then the same asymptotic
   formula holds also for F(n), since the ratio f(t)/θ0(t)=1+e−3πt+⋯  is
   equal to 1+O(n−K) for any K>0 for t near a. □

5. Proof of Theorems 1 and 2

A. Proof of Theorem 1

   For each d≥1, we use Theorem 3 with sequences {A(n)} and {δ(n)} for
   whichlogγ(n+j)γ(n)=A(n)j−j2δ(n)2+∑i=3dgi(n)ji+oδ(n)d,[15]for all 0≤j≤d,
   where gi(n)=oδ(n)i. Stirling’s formula, [13], and [14]
   giveγ(n)=en−2nn+12(1+112n)Ln^2n^−3n^n^+12(1+112n^)2πK⋅expL4−n^L+341+b1(
   n^)n^1+O1n2−ε,[16]where n^≔2n−2, L≔L(n^), and
   K≔K(n^)≔L(n^)−1+L(n^)−2n^−3/4. The L(n^) are values of a nonvanishing
   holomorphic function for R(n)>1, and so for |j|<n−1, we have the Taylor
   expansionL(j;n)≔L(n^+2j)L(n^)=1+∑m≥1ℓm(n)jmm!.If J=λ(n−1) with −1<λ<1,
   then the asymptotic L(n)≈log(nlog⁡n)
   implieslimn→+∞L(J,n)=limn→+∞Ln^(λ+1)L(n^)=1.In particular, we have
   ℓ1(n)=2K⋅L2 and ℓ2(n)=−8(n^−3/4L)(1+L/2)K3⋅L5 and ℓm(n)=o1(n−1)m. By a
   similar argument applied
   toK(j;n)≔K(n^+2j)K(n^)=1+∑m≥1km(n)jmm! and B(j;n)≔1+b1(n^+2j)n^+2j1+b1(
   n^)n^=1+∑m≥1βm(n)jmm!,we find that βm(n)=o1(n−1)m+1,
   k1(n)=2(L+1)K⋅L2−2n^(L+2)K2L4, and km(n)=o1(n−1)m for m≥2.

   Let R(j;n) be the approximation for γ(n+j)/γ(n) obtained from [16]. We
   then expand log⁡R(j;n)=:∑m≥1gm(n)jm, with the idea that we will choose
   A(n)∼g1(n) and δ(n)∼−g2(n). To this end, if J=λ(n−1) for −1<λ<1, then a
   calculation reveals
   that−(1+λ)log(1+λ)=limn→+∞log⁡R(J;n)−J⁡lognL24n^2−Jn−1.[17]Therefore,
   gm(n)=O(n−1)1−m, and algebraic manipulations
   giveg1(n)=lognL24n^2+n^ℓ1(n)L+1L−2L+ℓ1(n)⋅L4−k1(n)2+O1n2−ε,g2(n)=−1n^+4
   ℓ1(n)+n^ℓ2(n)L+12L−n^ℓ1(n)2L+22L+O1n2−ε.Using the formulas for
   ℓ1(n), ℓ2(n), and k1(n) above, we
   defineδ(n)≔1n^−2L2⋅K and A(n)≔lognL24n^2+L−1L2⋅K+n^(L+2)L4⋅K2.[18]The
   bounds for the gm(n) and the asymptotics above imply the o(1) error
   term in [15], and also that for sufficiently large n we have 0<δ(n)→0.
   Therefore, Theorem 3 applies, and its corollary gives Theorem 1.

B. Sketch of the Proof of Theorem 2

   Let A(n) and δ(n) be as in [18]. If we
   letJ^γd,n(X)≔δ(n)−dγ(n)⋅Jγd,nδ(n) X − 1exp(A(n))=∑k=0dβkd,nXk,then
   Theorem 1 implies that limn→+∞J^γd,n(X)=Hd(X) =: ∑k=0dhkXk. We have
   confirmed the hyperbolicity of the J^γd,n(X) for n≤106 and 4≤d≤8 using
   Hermite’s criterion (see theorem C of ref. 3).

   Using this criterion, we also chose vectors εd≔(εd(d),εd(d−1),…,εd(0))
   of positive numbers and signs sd,sd−1,…,s0∈{±1} for which J^γd,n(X) is
   hyperbolic if 0≤sk(βkd,n−hk)<εd(k) for all k. To make use of these
   inequalities, for positive integers n and 1≤j≤8, define real numbers
   C(n,j) byγ(n+j)γ(n)eA(n)j⋅eδ(n)2j2=1+C(n,j)n3/2.[19]Using an effective
   form of [16], it can be shown^∥ that 0<C(n,j)<14.25 for all n≥7 and
   1≤j≤8. Finally, we determined numbers Mεd for which the required
   inequalities hold for n≥Mεd. The proof follows from the fact that we
   found suitable choices for which Mεd<106.

Example 11:

   We illustrate the case of d=4 using ε4≔(0.041,1.384,0.813,7.313,0.804).
   For n≥100 the odd degree coefficients
   satisfy0<β34,n<28 δ(n) and −145.70δ(n)<β14,n<0,while the even degree
   coefficients
   satisfy1−16.05 δ(n)2<β44,n<1, −12<β24,n<−12+16.20 δ(n), 12−16.01 δ(n)<β
   04,n<12.It turns out that Mε4≔104<106.

6. Examples

   For convenience, we let the J^αd,n(X) denote the polynomials which
   converge to Hd(X) in [5]. We now illustrate Theorem 7 with [6], where
   m=1/24 and k=−1/2. Using [10], we may choose A(n)=2π24n−1−2424n−1 and
   δ(n)=12π(24n−1)3/2−288(24n−1)2. Although the one-term approximations of
   [10] given at the end of Section 3 also satisfy Theorem 3, the two-term
   approximations converge more quickly and better illustrate the result.
   With these data, we observe in Table 3 indeed that the degree 2 and 3
   partition Jensen polynomials are modeled by H2(X)=X2−2 and H3(X)=X3−6X.
