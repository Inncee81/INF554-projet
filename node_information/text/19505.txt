Error Messages

   This page describes the error messages that can be returned by the Maps
   JavaScript API. The Maps JavaScript API writes error and warning
   messages to the JavaScript console. Certain error conditions may also
   occur, which result in the display of a darkened watermarked map.

   If you are NOT the website owner, there are no steps you can take to
   fix any of these errors. However, you may want to notify the site owner
   if possible.

API Key and Billing Errors

   Attention customers in India

   As of September 10, 2018, usage for self-serve customers in India has
   been limited to $200/month. This situation is temporary. Please see the
   Maps FAQ for more details.

Troubleshooting

   Under certain circumstances, a darkened map, or 'negative' Street View
   image, watermarked with the text "for development purposes only", may
   be displayed. This behavior typically indicates issues with either an
   API key or billing. In order to use Google Maps Platform products,
   billing must be enabled on your account, and all requests must include
   a valid API key. The following flow will help you troubleshoot the
   issue.

Are you using an API key?

I'm not sure. How can I check if I am using an API key?

   An API key is passed as the key parameter in the URL that is used to
   load the Maps JavaScript API. Here are a few options to check if you
   are using an API key:
     * Use the Google Maps Platform API Checker Chrome extension. This
       allows you to determine if your website is properly implementing
       Google’s licensed Maps APIs.
     * If you are using a library or plugin to load the Maps JavaScript
       API, check the settings for that library and look for an API key
       option.
     * Check errors in your browser. If you see the following messages,
       you are not using your API key correctly:

     * Google Maps JavaScript API warning: NoApiKeys
     * Google Maps JavaScript API error: MissingKeyMapError

For web developers:

     * If you have access to the source code of your application, look for
       the <script> tag which is used to load the Maps JavaScript API.
       When loading the Maps JavaScript API, substitute YOUR_API_KEY in
       the code below with your API key.
  <script async defer
    src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_API_KEY&callback=initM
ap">
  </script>

     * Check the network traffic generated by your website in the browser.
       In Chrome, this can be viewed using the DevTools Network tab. Here
       you will see the network requests made by your website. Requests
       made using the Maps JavaScript API will be under the path
       maps/api/js. Here you can confirm if the requests are using the key
       parameter. It may be helpful to filter your network traffic by
       maps/api/js when viewing the Network tab.

No, I am not using an API key.

   Follow the steps here to Get, add, and restrict an API key .

Yes, I am using an API key.

   Great! Let’s move on and check if billing is enabled.

Is billing enabled on your account?

I'm not sure. How can I check if billing is enabled on my account?

   Navigate to the Google Cloud Platform Console and select the project
   under which your API key was created. To confirm the key is associated
   with the project:
    1. Go to the Credentials section, which can be accessed from the left
       side bar under APIs & Services > Credentials.
    2. Check that the API key you currently use on your website is listed.
       If that's not the case, switch to a different project, and check
       the credentials there.
    3. If you cannot locate the project for your API key, you may have
       lost access to this project. Ask others in your organization for
       help. If the original project cannot be located, you should:
         1. Create a new project. This can be done by selecting New
            Project from the projects list, or by selecting Create Project
            via the Resource Manager page.
         2. Create a new API key. This can be done on the Credentials
            page. Once there click Create credentials and then select API
            key.

   Once you have located your project in the Google Cloud Platform
   Console, check if billing is enabled by navigating to the Billing
   section in the left side menu.

No, billing has not been enabled on my account.

   You can enable billing on your account in the Google Cloud Platform
   Console.

Yes, billing has been enabled on my account.

   Great! Let’s make sure the provided billing method is valid.

Is the provided billing method no longer valid (for example an expired credit
card)?

   You can add, remove, or update a payment method in the Google Cloud
   Platform Console.

Is there an exceeded self-imposed daily limit on the API?

   If you have set a daily limit on any of your APIs, which is common to
   prevent unexpected increases, you can resolve this by increasing your
   daily limit.

   You can check your daily limits in the Google Cloud Platform Console by
   going to the APIs & Services Dashboard. Once there:
    1. Select a project if prompted.
    2. Select an API from the list, then click the Quotas tab.

Does your API key have an IP addresses restriction?

   API keys with an IP addresses restriction can only be used with web
   services that are intended for use from the server side (such as the
   Geocoding API and other Web Service APIs). Most of these web services
   have equivalent services within the Maps JavaScript API (for example,
   see the Geocoding Service). To use the Maps JavaScript API client side
   services, you will need to create a separate API key which can be
   secured with an HTTP referrers restriction (see Get, add, and restrict
   an API key ).

   For help on finding error messages, see the section on checking errors
   in your browser.

Maps JavaScript API Error Codes for Developers and Site Owners

   The following tables list the possible error codes returned by the Maps
   JavaScript API, with a description of the cause and how you can fix the
   problem. For help on finding the error messages, see the section on
   checking errors in your browser.

Map Loading Errors

   If you encounter an error while loading the Maps JavaScript API, please
   see the table below to find explanations for the error codes.
   Error Code Message Description
   NotLoadingAPIFromGoogleMapsError The Maps JavaScript API must be
   downloaded directly from Google's servers.

   The script element that loads the Maps JavaScript API is not being
   included correctly on your page. In order for the API to work
   correctly, it must be loaded directly from https://maps.googleapis.com.

   See Loading the Maps JavaScript API.
   TOSViolationMapError This website appears to violate the Google Maps
   API Terms of Service. The Google Maps API has been disabled for this
   website.

   Your application was blocked for non-compliance with the Google Maps
   Platform Terms of Service, following several email notifications. To
   appeal the block and have your implementation reviewed, please complete
   this form. You will receive a response via email within a few business
   days.

   If you have a Google Maps APIs Premium Plan license, please use your
   Google Maps APIs Premium Plan credentials to resolve this error. See
   the guide to Premium Plan authentication.
   UnauthorizedURLForClientIdMapError This URL is not authorized to use
   the Google Maps Client ID provided.

   The Premium Plan or Maps APIs for Work client ID included in the script
   load is invalid, expired, or the current address loading the Maps
   JavaScript API has not been added to the list of authorized URLs.

   See Registering Authorized URLs.

Maps JavaScript API Error Codes

   If you find an error on Chrome JavaScript Console, Firefox Web Console
   or any other equivalent tools on your browsers, please see the table
   below to find explanations for the error codes.

   The Maps JavaScript API returns both errors and warnings. An error
   indicates a severe issue which occurred while loading the Maps
   JavaScript API. Your page cannot load the API correctly, and the API
   will not work on that page. A warning is a supplemental message about
   the loading of the Maps JavaScript API. The warning describes the
   possible reasons for an error, or suggests potential issues in your
   code that loads the Maps JavaScript API. If you receive only warnings
   without any errors, the API will work correctly on that page. However,
   we recommend that you fix these potential issues as well.
   Developer Error Code Type Description
   ApiNotActivatedMapError Error

   The Maps JavaScript API is not activated on your API project. You may
   need to enable the Maps JavaScript API under APIs in the Google Cloud
   Platform Console.

   the Google Cloud Platform Console.

   For more information, see Get Started with Google Maps Platform.
   NoApiKeys Warning

   The script element that loads the API has no API key. Please make sure
   you include a valid API key as a key parameter. You can generate a new
   API key in the Google Cloud Platform Console.
   For more information, see Get Started with Google Maps Platform.

   If you are loading Maps JavaScript API from the deprecated v2 path with
   an old v2 key, you will get the NoApiKeys warning, even if you
   specified the key parameter. Please check the v2 to v3 upgrade guide
   and migrate your application to Maps JavaScript API v3.
   RetiredVersion Warning

   You may have supplied a retired version in your script element. Please
   update your application to use one of the available versions.

   See Versioning | Google Maps JavaScript API.
   SensorNotRequired Warning

   The sensor parameter is no longer required for the Maps JavaScript API.
   It won't prevent the Maps JavaScript API from working correctly, but we
   recommend that you remove the sensor parameter from the script element.
   SignatureNotRequired Warning

   The signature parameter is not required for the Maps JavaScript API. It
   won't prevent the Maps JavaScript API from working correctly, but it
   may introduce security risks. Please remove it from your script
   element.
   SignedInNotSupported Warning

   The signed_in parameter has been deprecated and is not supported on the
   version of the Maps JavaScript API you are using. This won't prevent
   the Maps JavaScript API from working, but the behavior of your
   application may change, if you rely on signed-in features.

   Please review your application and see Signed-in Maps | Google Maps
   JavaScript API for details about the deprecation.
   UrlAuthenticationCommonError Error

   An error has occurred that doesn't fit into the other categories on
   this page. This could be caused by a temporary problem. Please retry
   the request after a short delay. If that doesn't solve the problem,
   please review the developer's guide to make sure the request has the
   proper format.

Checking Errors in Your Browser

   The Maps JavaScript API writes error messages to window.console. This
   section explains how you can check the window.console output in Google
   Chrome. If you are using any other browsers, please check the developer
   documentation for your browser. For your reference, this is a list of
   tools to check window.console output in some other browsers.
     * Console for Internet Explorer.
     * Web Console for Firefox.
     * Remote debugging for Android.
     * Web Inspector for iOS.

   In Chrome, you can use the JavaScript Console to check window.console
   output as follows.
    1. To open the Developer Tools, select the menu icon > More Tools >
       Developer Tools.
    2. To open the JavaScript Console, press the ESC key on your keyboard.
       The ESC key will toggle the JavaScript Console. If you close the
       console, press the ESC key again to open it.

   If any errors or warnings occurred when loading the Maps JavaScript
   API, they appear as one or more lines in the console. An error or
   warning message has the following format:

   Google Maps API error: [ERROR CODE] [Link to API document]
   or
   Google Maps API warning: [ERROR CODE] [Link to API document]

   You can check the error codes table above to find the error code in the
   error message. You can also find the details about the error message in
   the API document linked from the message.

   Note: You can listen for authentication errors programmatically.

Handling unsupported browsers

   Ensure that the version of the browser you are using is currently
   supported by the Maps JavaScript API.
     * If you're using Internet Explorer (IE), upgrade to the latest IE
       version. In view of the end of support for older IE versions, you
       could also consider using any of the alternative browsers supported
       by the Maps JavaScript API.
     * If you're developing a native Windows application that runs in a
       webview, using an Internet Explorer version that's supported by the
       Maps JavaScript API, it's likely that your browser is reverting to
       a mode that uses Internet Explorer 7 by default. You can override
       this default behavior in the following ways:

     * Specify a legacy document mode by using the IE X-UA-Compatible meta
       header (recommended fix).
<meta http-equiv="x-ua-compatible" content="IE=edge">
     * Update the registry to use application-specific
       FEATURE_BROWSER_EMULATION registry keys.
