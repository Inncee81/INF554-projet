Rapinoe: I think I'm pretty close to my best now

     * Megan Rapinoe is The Best FIFA Women's Player 2019
     * The USA star claimed the award after a stellar France 2019
     * Rapinoe: "There were some incredible moments"

   Megan Rapinoe is The Best FIFA Women's Player 2019. The 34-year-old saw
   off USA team-mate Alex Morgan and England star Lucy Bronze to claim the
   highest individual prize in women's football.

   The award caps a remarkable year both personally - she claimed the
   adidas Golden Boot and Golden Ball at the FIFA Women's World Cup France
   2019‚Ñ¢ - and with the USA who won the France 2019 title in July.
   FIFA.com caught up with Rapinoe moments after she received her trophy
   on stage at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan.

   FIFA.com: How does it feel to hold The Best FIFA Women‚Äôs Player award
   in your hand? Megan Rapinoe: It‚Äôs extremely heavy! To hold it in my
   hands is a dream come true, it‚Äôs very exciting. Credit to everyone else
   in my life, I wouldn‚Äôt be here without all of them. It‚Äôs quite surreal
   to be honest, I‚Äôve never been to [The Best FIFA Football Awards], and
   I‚Äôm quite old for it to be my first one!

   You made a pretty powerful acceptance speech, how did it feel to have
   that stage to speak to the world?
   In a room full of such influential and powerful people and people that
   have the ability to change the world, it felt like it was the right
   time and the right opportunity to say what I had to say.

     Megan Rapinoe: The Best FIFA Women's Player 2019 acceptance speech

     An empassioned speech from üá∫üá∏ Megan Rapinoe üòç Having had an amazing
     2019, where she won her second FIFA Women's World Cup title, the
     U.S. Soccer star was crowned as #TheBest FIFA Women's Player. üèÜüèÜ
     Posted by FIFA Football Awards on Monday, 23 September 2019

   It‚Äôs been a really good year of football. Who did you enjoy watching
   playing, on both sides: men and women?
   I mean, we had the Women‚Äôs World Cup ‚Äì the whole thing was amazing.
   There were some incredible moments. Thailand scoring their first goal,
   I thought Norway were great. We did... alright! Playing in France, in
   Paris at the Parc des Princes was incredible. I don‚Äôt know if I can
   pick out one player. Maybe Sam Kerr, she‚Äôs tearing it up. She‚Äôs just a
   goal a game, every game.

   On the men‚Äôs side‚Ä¶ I think my favourite player right now is Kevin de
   Bruyne. He‚Äôs kind of low key but he is just incredible. He pulls all
   the strings in that midfield for City.

   At France 2019, you won the adidas Golden Ball and adidas Golden Boot ‚Äì
   have we seen the very best of you?
   I never really want to put a limit on myself, but I think we‚Äôre
   probably pretty close to the top right now! The last couple of years
   have definitely been the top, but I think to put it all together into
   the most important tournament for us and to be able to bring the trophy
   home for our country again, that‚Äôs got to be a high for me.

   What were the differences between the journey in 2015 and in 2019?
   They were vastly different. Even now I was only a few years older, it
   felt like I was way older. I had such an incredible group of veterans
   that were with me almost my whole career. Having to take that much more
   of a leadership role, becoming almost instantly one of the oldest
   players on the whole team after all of them retired‚Ä¶ just a whole lot
   more responsibility and you just have to think about a lot more. With
   that there‚Äôs a different sense of pride almost in that you‚Äôre taking
   care of the team and doing all these other things and then you see the
   team succeed and then you‚Äôre proud of your team in a different way.

   Jill Ellis only has a couple of games left as the USWNT coach. If you
   had to say thanks to Jill for something, what would it be?
   I think Jill put us all in a position to be the best players we can be.
   I think it showed on the field that we had incredible chemistry as a
   team and we knew exactly the way that we were going to win. That was a
   lot different from 2015 where I felt like the whole tournament we were
   kind of figuring out exactly what we were going to do, this time it
   felt like we just kind of looked in each other‚Äôs eyes and knew exactly
   the way that we wanted to play, and that was a huge credit to Jill and
   the coaching staff.

Messi: It's the team that counts

     * Lionel Messi crowned The Best FIFA Men‚Äôs Player in Milan
     * Beat fellow finalists Cristiano Ronaldo and Virgil van Dijk to the
       award
     * Messi speaks to FIFA about the season past and his future with club
       and country

   Milan‚Äôs Teatro alla Scala acclaimed #TheBest on Monday evening. Lionel
   Messi collected The Best FIFA Men‚Äôs Player award for the first time,
   though it is the sixth time that he has been recognised by world
   football‚Äôs governing body as the player of the year.

   After beating fellow finalists Cristiano Ronaldo and Virgil van Dijk to
   the award, the 32-year-old Argentinian star shared his views of the
   evening with FIFA and looked back on his award-winning season.

You‚Äôve won a lot of awards but this is your first The Best. How do you feel?

   I‚Äôm very happy to receive this award. Like I always say, though,
   individual awards are secondary to me because it‚Äôs the team that
   counts. It‚Äôs a special night because I‚Äôm lucky enough to have my wife
   here and two of my three children as well. To be able to enjoy this
   moment with them is unique.

     Lionel Messi: The Best

     He's been the best there is plenty of times before, but it remained
     a special night for Leo Messi. üèÜüá¶üá∑ Here's what it's like being
     crowned The Best FIFA Men's Player üëë
     Posted by FIFA Football Awards on Tuesday, 24 September 2019

This award aside, how would you sum up the season you‚Äôve just had?

   It was strange. We were having a fantastic season as a team and then
   one match changed it all (Barcelona‚Äôs defeat to Liverpool in the second
   leg of their UEFA Champions League semi-final). It was such a massive
   disappointment that we just didn‚Äôt attach any importance to the League
   and we didn‚Äôt prepare properly for the Copa del Rey final. That‚Äôs how
   big a blow it was for us. That one game left its mark on a season that
   had been perfect up to then. We were so close to making another
   Champions League final, but it ended up being a painful campaign for
   us.

At the recent UEFA awards, you were seen chatting very amicably with
Cristiano Ronaldo. Why do you think people are surprised when they see both
of you getting along together?

   Because of the big sporting rivalry that‚Äôs developed between us over
   the last few years, because one us played for Barcelona and the other
   for [Real] Madrid, and because we won individual awards. People perhaps
   think the rivalry goes beyond football, but it doesn‚Äôt. We both want
   what‚Äôs best for our teams and neither of us like losing. It‚Äôs something
   we don‚Äôt accept. That‚Äôs why there‚Äôs that competitiveness between us.
   The important thing is that it stays there, out on the pitch.

We‚Äôve seen some new faces at Barcelona at the start of the season, such as
Ansu Fati. What do you make of the expectation he‚Äôs generating?

   I really like him and I try to help and support him. He‚Äôs an amazing
   player and he‚Äôs got what it takes to succeed. But if I look at it
   through my eyes, I‚Äôd like them to bring him on gradually, like they did
   with me when I started, taking things nice and easy and without putting
   pressure on him. You have to remember that he‚Äôs only 16. I hope he
   keeps on enjoying it and that all the fuss around him doesn‚Äôt have a
   negative impact on him because he has the quality to become one of the
   best.

So now you can understand how Ronaldinho treated you when you started out.

   Ronaldinho and [Frank] Rijkaard too, who was the coach back then. In
   fact, I‚Äôd say the whole team. Everyone helped me in one way or another,
   especially the coach when he left me out and I used to get annoyed
   (smiles). Now that I‚Äôm older I‚Äôve come to understand that was the best
   thing for me and I‚Äôll always be grateful to him for that. I‚Äôve told him
   that too. The way he handled me was really important.

The Argentinian national team are undergoing a major transformation too. Have
any of your team-mates surprised you in particular?

   I wouldn‚Äôt say they‚Äôve surprised me because I knew them already and I
   know what they‚Äôre capable of. I see them with their clubs and I knew
   about the new breed coming through. Where they have surprised me,
   though, is as people. There were a lot of them that I didn‚Äôt know
   personally, and it was a lovely surprise to be able to share a Copa
   America with them and see that aside from being great players they‚Äôre
   very normal and down-to-earth people too.

Lionel Scaloni has just been given the Argentina job on a permanent basis.
How would you describe him?

   He‚Äôs a coach who has things clear in his head, who knows how to watch
   football and is very good at getting things across. He‚Äôs easy to
   understand, he‚Äôs good at his job and he knows how to handle the
   players. I think they got it right in giving him the job permanently
   and the space and time he needs to work with the national team.

Talking of Scaloni and looking at Pablo Aimar, do you see yourself as a coach
one day?

   I‚Äôve always said that I don‚Äôt, but you never know. I look at them and
   start thinking that I would like to work with youngsters, to train them
   and coach them, but right now I honestly can‚Äôt see it happening. It
   might happen over the new few years, though. I don‚Äôt know.

And talking of coach, we have to ask you about Diego Maradona‚Äôs return to
Argentinian football. Did you see him take up his new job?

   Yes, I saw it. Obviously I‚Äôm delighted to see him back, to see him
   coaching again. I was there when he was in charge of the national team
   and he really enjoyed it, lived it to the maximum. He has to do the
   same now with Gimnasia. I‚Äôm delighted he‚Äôs back in Argentinian
   football, which is where he has to be if you ask me.

And what about you? Are you thinking of ending your career back in Argentina?

   Yes. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve always said, haven‚Äôt I? It‚Äôs a childhood dream of
   mine to play in the Newell‚Äôs shirt, though I don‚Äôt know if I can make
   it happen. It‚Äôs not just down to me, though. I‚Äôve got three children.

La Liga, the Champions League and the Copa America: what is Lionel Messi‚Äôs
main objective this season?

   All of them. It‚Äôs been four years since we‚Äôve won the Champions League
   and we really want to win it again. We know, though, that if we don‚Äôt
   do the job day in day out, then we won‚Äôt make it. And as for the Copa
   America, I‚Äôm really looking forward to having the opportunity to go for
   it yet again. I‚Äôm really excited about this year‚Äôs Copa.

   FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup

Asian pair earn passage to world stage

   25 Sep 2019
   AFC U-16 Women's Championship 2019 - Korea DPR celebrate a goal against
   China PR ¬© AFC
     * Korea DPR and Japan book U-17 Women's World Cup berths
     * Pair join hosts India for next year's tournament
     * Next year's competition will run 2-21 November

   Asia‚Äôs line-up for the 2020 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup is complete as
   Korea DPR and Japan booked their berths at the tournament, joining
   hosts India, after progressing to the final of the AFC U-16 Women‚Äôs
   Championship.

   Kim Hye-yong bagged a brace before Kim Pom-I added another late on as
   Korea DPR advanced to Saturday‚Äôs decider after beating Australia 3-0
   and secured a seventh successive top-two finish at the AFC U-16 Women‚Äôs
   Championship.

   ‚ÄúIt was very a difficult match for our girls, but we scored three goals
   and conceded none and we very happy that we got the ticket to the FIFA
   U-17 Women‚Äôs World Cup,‚Äù Hwang Yong-song, Korea DPR head coach, told
   the-afc.com. ‚ÄúThe team‚Äôs responsibility is getting higher because we
   are going to represent Asian teams.‚Äù

     FT: PRK üá∞üáµ 3 - 0 üá¶üá∫ AUS

   In their way of Thailand 2019 glory lies Japan, who battled to a 2-0
   victory over China PR with second-half goals coming from Hanon Nishio
   Maika and Maika Hamano.

   ‚ÄúWe were expecting the game to be tough because we both played
   aggressively from the start,‚Äù Japan head coach Michihisa Kano told
   the-afc.com. ‚ÄúIt was difficult in the first half, but the players were
   patient and calm, and then we scored the two goals. So, we‚Äôre very
   pleased.‚Äù

   Both finalists join the hosts at India 2020, which takes place next
   year from 2-21 November. Both Korea DPR and Japan exited the U-17
   Women's World Cup at the quarter-final stage last year at Uruguay 2018.

   In an opulent ceremony that saw a star-studded cast of footballing
   talent descend on Milan‚Äôs Teatro alla Scala, the beautiful game‚Äôs
   foremost artistes saw their performances rewarded at The Best FIFA
   Football Awards‚Ñ¢ in one of the globe‚Äôs cultural centres.

   Lionel Messi and Jurgen Klopp took home the leading honours for The
   Best FIFA Men‚Äôs Player and Men‚Äôs Coach respectively, after their
   outstanding 2018/19 campaigns which saw both scoop silverware and
   individual accolades galore. It was a bumper year for the USA as Megan
   Rapinoe and Jill Ellis were rewarded for their part in the Stars and
   Stripes‚Äô triumph at the FIFA Women‚Äôs World Cup France 2019‚Ñ¢ as The Best
   FIFA Women‚Äôs Player and Women‚Äôs Coach respectively.

     Megan Rapinoe: The Best FIFA Women's Player 2019 acceptance speech

     An empassioned speech from üá∫üá∏ Megan Rapinoe üòç Having had an amazing
     2019, where she won her second FIFA Women's World Cup title, the
     U.S. Soccer star was crowned as #TheBest FIFA Women's Player. üèÜüèÜ
     Posted by FIFA Football Awards on Monday, 23 September 2019

   In an event very much geared towards celebrating the women‚Äôs game, to
   honour the legacy of the record-breaking France 2019, Sari van
   Veenendaal was named the inaugural The Best FIFA Women‚Äôs Goalkeeper,
   joining her custodian counterpart Alisson who picked up The Best FIFA
   Men‚Äôs Goalkeeper award.

   There was recognition for a women‚Äôs ‚Äòdream team‚Äô for the first time at
   The Best FIFA Football Awards, with FIFA and FIFPro combining for the
   first time to honour the FIFA FIFPro Women‚Äôs World11. The recipients of
   the inaugural award were a veritable who‚Äôs who of France 2019, with the
   aforementioned Sari van Veenendaal joined by USA stars Kelley O‚ÄôHara,
   Julie Ertz, Rose Lavelle, Alex Morgan and Megan Rapinoe as well as
   French duo Wendie Renard and Amandine Henry, Brazilian legend Marta,
   England‚Äôs outstanding performer Lucy Bronze and Swedish rock Nilla
   Fischer.

   The FIFA FIFPro Men‚Äôs World11 saw a number of new names enter the fray.
   Alisson made his debut in the ‚Äòdream team‚Äô, alongside Dutch trio
   Matthijs de Ligt, Frenkie de Jong and Virgil van Dijk. The remainder of
   the side - Marcelo, Sergio Ramos, Eden Hazard, Luka Modric, Cristiano
   Ronaldo, Kylian Mbappe and Lionel Messi - retained their place from the
   2018 World11. Both star-studded line-ups were elected by thousands of
   players from across the globe.

   The players had their say, and so did the fans, who voted for the
   heartwarming story of Silvia Grecco to take home the FIFA Fan Award. A
   public vote also determined the top three of the FIFA Pusk√°s Award,
   with a panel of FIFA Legends ultimately choosing Daniel Zsori‚Äôs
   remarkable overhead kick as a worthy goal of the year.

   The FIFA Fair Play Award was taken home by Marcelo Bielsa and the Leeds
   United squad, after the Argentinean coach and his team ultimately
   sacrificed promotion for his team to uphold the values of fair play ‚Äì
   instructing his Leeds United team to allow an equaliser after his side
   had gone 1-0 up with an opposition player down injured.

   In an evening that saw the remarkable talents of the Teatro alla Scala
   Orchestra showcased as the musical entertainment, it was fitting that
   the orchestrators of beautiful music on pitches the world over were
   recognised as The Best in Milano.
