Trump again denounces ‘horrific terrorist attack’
       ‘As president, I will do what is necessary is to prevent this
       threat from spreading to our shores,’ President Donald Trump said.
   By Rebecca Morin
       6/5/17, 3:54 AM CET
       U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday called the attacks in London
       a "horrific terrorist attack," adding that he will do whatever is
       necessary to prevent such threats from reaching the United States.
       "We renew our resolve, stronger than ever before, to protect the
       United States and its allies from a vile enemy that has waged war
       on innocent life," Trump said while attending the Ford's Theatre
       Annual Gala, according to pool reports.
       "And it has gone on too long. This bloodshed must end. This
       bloodshed will end. As president, I will do what is necessary is to
       prevent this threat from spreading to our shores."
       Trump, who had earlier tweeted an assortment of remarks about the
       attack both Saturday night and Sunday morning, also said he spoke
       with British Prime Minister Theresa May to "express our unwavering
       support," according to the pool report. He also said the U.S. will
       do everything in its power to assist the United Kingdom to "bring
       those that are guilty to justice" and that "American sends our
       thoughts and prayers."
       The Saturday night terrorist attack claimed seven lives, left
       dozens more hospitalized and ended with police shooting dead three
       attackers.

Merkel and Schulz fight over who’s better European
       The German chancellor and her challenger are fighting on two fronts
       to claim the title of European champion.

       BERLIN — Who can make Europe great again?
       That question has become central in Germany's general election
       campaign, with conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel and her Social
       Democrat challenger Martin Schulz battling to be seen as the
       candidate best placed to strengthen the European Union.
       After so many years of Euro-pessimism, the EU is suddenly seen as a
       vote winner, as it was in France for Emmanuel Macron last
       month. Both Merkel and Schulz have increased the emphasis on Europe
       in their campaigns for September's parliamentary election, sensing
       that voters see a strong EU as the best response to uncertainty
       caused by U.S. President Donald Trump's moves away from established
       international alliances, Russia's increased military
       assertiveness in Eastern Europe and Britain's Brexit vote.
       The Social Democrats had thought European integration would be a
       winning issue for them, as Schulz is a former president of the
       European Parliament who spent more than two decades in Brussels.
       Moreover, he is running against a chancellor whose longtime Finance
       Minister Wolfgang Schäuble has become the epitome of austerity
       policies that have divided the EU between its wealthier north and
       southern countries hit hard by the sovereign debt crisis, such as
       Greece.
       But Merkel has proved adept at exploiting her status as the EU's
       pre-eminent political leader, most recently in the beer hall speech
       that went around the world — in which the chancellor lamented that
       Europe could no longer fully rely on others and declared: "We
       Europeans truly have to take our fate into our own hands."

     It's not the first time that the Social Democrats have tried to
     claim Macron as one of their own.
       Since then, her conservative bloc has managed to increase an
       already substantial lead over the SPD in opinion polls. It now has
       the support of 39 percent of voters — 14 percentage points ahead of
       the SPD at 25 percent, according to a survey by public broadcaster
       ZDF.
       But the SPD is not about to give up on the EU as an election issue.

Germans lose appetite for Greens
            Janosch Delcker
       “Europe needs to be moved into the center of the campaign," Michael
       Roth, the SPD's minister of state for Europe, said at a conference
       at the foreign ministry on Thursday.
       "There are entirely different ideas about what a united Europe
       means," Roth said. It will now be up to the SPD to explain how
       their vision of Europe is different from Merkel's — and to persuade
       German voters that it's also more attractive.
       The battle to be the best European is being fought on two fronts:

1. Making the most of Macron
       After the charismatic pro-European candidate Macron won France's
       presidential election in May, the idea of the Franco-German axis as
       a guarantor of stability in Europe became a central theme in the
       German election campaign. That idea was reinforced by Trump's
       appearances at NATO and G7 summits that cast doubt on Washington's
       reliability as an ally.
       The Social Democrats' great fear is that Merkel, who appears
       regularly on the global stage alongside Macron, will be primarily
       associated with this Franco-German engine — even though she and
       Macron differ on details of how to reform Europe.
       So the SPD is trying to send out the message that if German voters
       truly want the European Union to change, new faces in both Paris
       and Berlin will be necessary. And the party is not being too subtle
       about it either.

       “Macron needs a dynamic politician with experience in European
       politics as his partner,” Schulz told a crowd gathered in the
       SPD-led foreign ministry in Berlin on Thursday.
       He stressed that he knew Macron well and the two of them had
       discussed some of the French president's proposals for EU reform
       back when Schulz was head of the European Parliament and Macron was
       France's economy minister.
       “And I remember very well that the chancellor … and her finance
       minister [Schäuble] loudly said ‘no way’ to those considerations
       back then,” he added.
       It's not the first time that the Social Democrats have tried to
       claim Macron as one of their own.
       When Macron made his first visit as president to Berlin, SPD
       Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel went to the airport to greet him
       personally — before the new French leader met with Merkel.
       Afterward, Gabriel's official Facebook page featured a picture of
       the welcome with the caption "Two old friends."
       So far, however, the SPD's efforts seem to have had little effect.
       National and international media coverage portrays Macron and
       Merkel as a pro-European, multilateralist duo moving forward on
       issues such as security, migration, and eurozone reform.
       “A magic dwells in each beginning,” Merkel quoted from German
       author Hermann Hesse at a press conference last month following her
       first meeting with President Macron, who’s known as a connoisseur
       of German literature.
       A few weeks later, a video showing Macron swerving away from Donald
       Trump to embrace Merkel at last moth's NATO summit in Brussels went
       viral in Germany.

2. Money talks
       If the SPD wants to present itself as the party that's willing to
       go deeper when it comes to European integration, it faces a
       challenge: most Germans are committed pro-Europeans but they are
       hesitant about paying out more money. The country is already one of
       the major net contributors to the EU budget.
       "In Germany, there is a sort of Pavlovian conditioning to say, 'No
       more money,' when we talk about EU finances," Schulz said on
       Thursday. But he quickly added that he was "not talking about
       [spending] more money."
       Anticipating attacks by his conservative rivals, Schulz stressed
       early in his campaign that as chancellor he would not necessarily
       change much about Germany’s insistence on debt reduction and
       structural reforms in crisis-ridden eurozone countries.

       Images
       But such statements mean the SPD still needs to explain exactly how
       it would act differently from Merkel.
       Schulz's strategy so far has been to stress reforms he would like
       to make to the EU budget. In other words, it's not about paying
       more for Europe, it's about focusing on how the money is spent.
       This, Schulz said, could involve coming up with a joint budget for
       the eurozone, as suggested by Macron — although the SPD leader
       added important caveats: "If the eurozone comes up with joint tasks
       in the labor market, in tax policy, in investment policy — joint
       tasks supported by all members of the eurozone."
       We're up for fundamental reforms, while Merkel's conservatives are
       primarily interested in preserving the status quo — that's the
       message the SPD will try to send.
       "To fight for a united Europe is and remains a matter close to my
       heart," Schulz said on Thursday at a meeting of the SPD's
       parliamentary group in the Bundestag.
       This passion, he added, was not something he recently discovered in
       a beer tent.

When going home is a death sentence

   Forcibly sending refugees back to an unsafe country violates

   KABUL, Afghanistan — The moment you step outside the airport in Kabul,
   Afghanistan, the first thing that strikes you are the roses. They are
   everywhere — lining the dusty motorway into town, clustering flowerbeds
   in traffic circles, blooming in private gardens.

   The second thing you see is fear. Foreigners hide behind their
   sandbagged walls, barbed wire, armed guards and bulletproof vehicles.
   But many locals are terrified too, including those who fled the country
   but were recently returned against their will.

   There is every reason to be afraid. The fragile government is
   struggling to make headway against the Taliban, which is likely more
   powerful now than at any time since 2001. Other armed opposition groups
   — including the so-called Islamic State — have seized control of parts
   of the country and carry out devastating attacks even in securitized
   areas of Kabul and elsewhere.

   Violent incidents are increasingly frequent. According to the U.N.,
   2016 was the deadliest year for civilian casualties since its records
   began in 2009. While my Amnesty International colleagues and I were in
   Kabul in May, a German aid worker and an Afghan guard were killed, and
   a Finnish woman likely kidnapped, during an attack on a Swedish NGO in
   the city. Wednesday’s horrific bomb attack near the German embassy in
   central Kabul shows that rather than winding down, the conflict in
   Afghanistan is escalating dangerously.

   British and American authorities warn their citizens against traveling
   to Afghanistan, saying it remains unsafe “due to the ongoing risk of
   kidnapping, hostage-taking, military combat operations, landmines,
   banditry, armed rivalry between political and tribal groups” and
   “insurgent attacks.”

     When Azad found out he was going to be deported, he tried to kill
     himself and was put under suicide watch until he was forcibly
     returned.

   And yet, Western governments have deemed the country safe enough for
   Afghan asylum seekers to return. Over the past decade and a half, a
   number of European countries (as well as Australia) have signed
   Memoranda of Understanding with Afghanistan, through which the country
   agrees to readmit its citizens under certain conditions. These types of
   arrangements are not necessarily unreasonable, but their implementation
   must conform with international law, which prohibits states from
   transferring people if there is a risk of serious human rights
   violations.

   Nonetheless, even as the situation in Afghanistan has unmistakably
   worsened, Western governments have escalated their efforts to return
   Afghans fleeing war and persecution.

Top German politician wants to deport ill migrants, Afghans
       Cynthia Kroet

   At an aid conference in October 2016, under pressure from the European
   Union, the Afghan government signed the EU-Afghanistan “Joint Way
   Forward,” a document that paves the way for the forcible return of an
   unlimited number of Afghans from Europe. One unnamed Afghan government
   official called the agreement a “poisoned cup” the country was forced
   to accept in return for development aid.

   Hundreds of returns have taken place since the agreement was signed six
   months ago. My colleagues and I recently spoke with Afghans deported
   from Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. While everyone in
   Afghanistan is at risk, many of the returnees we spoke to were
   extremely vulnerable, and their returns likely violated international
   law.

   A young man, whom I’ll call “Azad,” is at serious risk because of his
   sexual orientation. Afghanistan criminalizes same-sex sexual conduct,
   and there have been reports of harassment, violence and detention by
   police. When Azad found out he was going to be deported, he tried to
   kill himself and was put under suicide watch until he was forcibly
   returned.

   This was his first time in Kabul, he told me. “I have nowhere to go,”
   he said. “Maybe I will join the other drug addicts in the west of the
   city, just to get some shelter.”

   Despite his young age, Azad has survived a number of tragedies. After
   fleeing the war in Afghanistan as a child, he grew up in Iran, and
   later lost his mother when the family tried to make its way to Europe.
   While clearly frightened throughout our conversation, he broke down
   when speaking about her death. “All I want to do is visit her grave.”

   Another man, “Farid,” is in danger of religious persecution for
   converting to Christianity. Like Azad, he left Afghanistan as a child,
   grew up in Iran, then fled to a European country. He is terrified about
   what will happen to him in Afghanistan. Still in shock after being
   wrenched from his adopted country and faith community, he said: “I feel
   like I’ve fallen from the sky. I don’t believe I’m here.”

   He, too, had never been to Kabul. “I don’t know anything about
   Afghanistan,” he told me. “Where will I go? I don’t have funds to live
   alone and I can’t live with relatives because they will see that I
   don’t pray.”

   Their stories are, unfortunately, far from exceptional. Some deportees
   have already suffered violence after being forcibly returned to
   Afghanistan. An Afghan who returned from Germany in January was injured
   in a suicide attack near the Supreme Court just two weeks later,
   according to a recent report by the Afghan Analysts Network. Several
   other people — including young children — were injured in attacks by
   armed groups in Kabul, a member of the Afghanistan Migrants Advice and
   Support Organization told us.

   None of these people should have been sent back. When they walked out
   of the airport, the country was probably as unknown to many of them as
   it was to me — and they face far greater risks.

   European governments and leaders know Afghanistan is not safe. If they
   don’t stop deporting people like Azad and Farid, they will have blood
   on their hands.
