   [avclub-saturated.png] Age Of HeroesWith Age Of Heroes, Tom Breihan
   picks the most important superhero movie of every year, starting with
   the genre’s early big-budget moments and moving onto the
   multiplex-crushing monsters of today.

   Christopher Nolan’s Batman movies are as revered as any franchise of
   summer blockbusters can really be in this day and age. But when people
   make fun of them, they always seem to settle on one thing in
   particular: the Batman voice. When he’s in his Batman suit, Christian
   Bale doesn’t have too many long conversations, but when he does talk,
   it’s in some hybrid of grumpy-dad growl and death-metal grunt. It’s a
   deeply silly construction, this guttural constipated snarl. I fucking
   love it.

   2005’s Batman Begins, Nolan’s introduction to the rebooted franchise,
   was the first Batman movie where a villain wasn’t the most interesting
   character. There are, of course, plenty of villains. Liam Neeson makes
   a couple of surprise turns, rocking some insanely impressive facial
   hair and leading a mob of mysterious, culture-reshaping ninjas. Cillian
   Murphy gives amazing mad-scientist, preening and gibbering and bugging
   his eyes out. The way he delivers the phrase “the Bat Man” is great;
   the way he’s taken out by a secondary character’s taser is less so.
   Even the actorly eminence Tom Wilkinson gets in a walk-on role as a
   mobster, sticking around long enough to make one great speech about how
   “people from your world have so much to lose.”

   They’re all interesting characters, and they all have classically
   impeccable actors playing them. But for once, Batman gets to be the
   real star of a Batman movie. And that voice is the key to it. Christian
   Bale’s Bruce Wayne has been traumatized and sent down a
   self-destructive path. He’s ejected himself from society and gone off
   on the sort of finding-himself quest that has led him to gratuitously
   beat up fellow inmates at a Chinese prison camp. When he finally
   figures out some direction in life, he wants to stop being whatever he
   is and start being a forbidding and shadowy symbol. Using that voice
   isn’t his version of Christopher Reeve’s Clark Kent bumbling around all
   over the place. He’s not doing that voice so that people won’t
   recognize him as Bruce Wayne. He’s doing that voice so that people
   won’t recognize him as a human being.

   As a disguise, though, it works. My favorite scene from Batman Begins
   comes late in the movie, when Bruce Wayne is throwing himself a
   birthday party and realizes that it’s been infiltrated by his old clan
   of conspiratorial ninjas. So he goes into billionaire-asshole mode,
   drunkenly kicking all of his guests out and insulting them in the
   process. In that moment, Bale taps into some of the same oily
   rich-dipshit charisma that he’d conveyed so memorably in Mary Harron’s
   American Psycho five years earlier. He acts the way most actual rich
   guys act. He displays petty grudges, demands to be the center of
   attention, and sneers at anyone with less money than himself. He’s a
   perfect dickhead. He does this to save everyone from the lurking
   ninjas, but he also helps solidify the idea that he couldn’t be Batman.
   Because he’s a rich asshole, and when’s the last time a rich asshole
   showed any interest in being anything other than a rich asshole?

   Batman Begins was a movie with a mission. In the new era of profitable
   comic book blockbusters, Warner Bros. needed to erase the stink of the
   Joel Schumacher Batman movies, camp explosions that became instant
   cultural punchlines from the moment—in the lead-up to Batman & Robin’s
   release date—that the announcement about the Bat-nipples came out.
   Batman Begins exists to set up other movies, too. But even if we’d
   never gotten The Dark Knight out of it, even if the movie had lost tons
   of money and sent Warner scrambling to imagine another reboot, Batman
   Begins would still stand as a pretty amazing example of superhero-movie
   craft.

   Nolan was an inspired choice for this whole enterprise. He’d made his
   impact with the relentlessly clever Memento. With Insomnia, he’d proved
   that he could work with movie stars. With all of his films, he’d shown
   a visual flair and a fascination with the nuts and bolts of story.
   Batman Begins was his leveling-up moment, his big leap into the
   blockbuster arena.

   And Warner must’ve had a whole lot of faith in him. Batman Begins is
   not a movie that skimps on anything. The producers built a pretty
   decent chunk of Gotham City on soundstages in London. They designed the
   Tumbler, a monstrous new version of the Batmobile, and they built four
   working and street-ready versions of it, including one with a literal
   jet engine inside it. They designed a whole new martial arts system for
   Bruce Wayne to practice. And they filled the cast out with
   Oscar-caliber actors, with people like Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine
   and Gary Oldman all taking on relatively minor roles. Ken Watanabe is
   barely in it. Rutger Hauer gets what amounts to an extended cameo. Even
   the weird-looking little kid who Katie Holmes saves, while not remotely
   famous at the time, would go on to play Joffrey on Game Of Thrones.

   For his big Batman reimagining, Nolan wanted to ground the character,
   and his whole world, in something that at least vaguely resembled
   plausible reality. And he put so much care into what he was building.
   Visually, the movie is rich as hell. In the early scene where Christian
   Bale climbs a mountain to meet his ninja clan, we get helicopter shots
   of snowy mountain vistas, banners randomly flapping behind Bale, and
   flowers that look too blue to be real. Nolan finds ways to turn Thomas
   Wayne, a hopeless dupe in almost every retelling of the Batman myth,
   into a decent human being. (Nolan takes pains to make Bruce into the
   descendent of a long line of good rich people, to the point where
   Alfred casually mentions that the Batcave was a stop on the Underground
   Railroad.) He draws lines between economic depression (which, it turns
   out, was caused by ninjas) and high crime rates, and he resists the
   urge to turn Bruce’s parents’ killer into a mindless psychopath.

   Bruce doesn’t become Batman until an hour into the movie, and by that
   time, Nolan has already drawn up a rich world of corrupt politicians,
   corrupt corporate lackeys, corrupt cops, lordly crime bosses, and
   hopelessly trapped regular people. And so there’s a tremendous charge
   in that first transformation scene, with Batman only appearing in
   flashes, and with goons disappearing into shadows. It’s a slasher-movie
   scene, except the slasher is our hero.

   I have this distinct memory of leaving the theater with a friend after
   watching Batman Begins, both of our minds blown, raving about what we’d
   just seen. Superhero movies were just entering their boom period, but
   all of them, even the best ones, had been knowingly silly. No other
   filmmaker had ever really considered the idea that you could tell a
   story like this without winking at least a little bit. But Nolan didn’t
   wink. He took the character and the world around him seriously,
   treating an American myth with a gravity that had never really been on
   screen before. My friend and I were so dumbfounded that I’m pretty sure
   we used the word “believable” to describe what we’d just seen.

   Now, Batman Begins is not a believable movie. There is no way to tell a
   plausible story about a billionaire who, driven by a desire to make the
   world a better place, dresses up like a scary rodent and beats up
   mobsters. And Batman Begins is, at times, deeply silly. History, we
   learn, has been driven entirely by ninja interventions. Batman somehow
   summons a swarm of bats, from his cave, to help him fight off a
   deranged rogue psychiatrist’s goons. A giant rolling assault vehicle
   escapes a horde of police cars and helicopters mostly by turning off
   its lights. And the central evil plan is convoluted and absurd enough
   to leave Lex Luthor muttering to himself. The bad guys want to use a
   weapons-grade microwave to evaporate an entire city’s water supply,
   thus activating the weaponized-hallucinogen fear gas that they’ve been
   pumping into it, and turning the entire population into a wild and
   violent mob. There are easier ways to destroy a city, you know?

   Batman Begins is also a movie full of movie bullshit, characters who
   don’t remain remotely consistent. After spending who knows how long in
   the thrall of a ninja cult, Bruce Wayne refuses to kill a murderous
   farmer, so he sets off an explosion that must kill a whole lot of
   people, presumably including that same murderous farmer. Bruce’s
   butler, Alfred, inherits the entire Wayne estate, happily telling Bruce
   that maybe he can borrow the Rolls. The next time we see Alfred, he’s
   carrying a tray. Upon repeat viewings, little things like that really
   jump out.

   And while this doesn’t have anything to do with the plausibility, I
   have to mention the action scenes. Nolan sets the scenes up in clear
   and compelling ways. He brings in fight choreographers and sends his
   stars to study martial arts. He has a whole lot of ninjas in there. And
   yet the fight scenes are all indistinguishable blurs, full of shaky
   camerawork and choppy editing. This was the style at the time, and
   Nolan’s action scenes have gotten gradually better over the years, to
   the point where the aerial-dogfight scenes in last year’s Dunkirk are
   the best of their kind I’ve ever seen. But the Batman Begins fights are
   pure amateur hour. It drove me fucking nuts. How could this guy be so
   good at every aspect of action-movie filmmaking except for the actual
   action?

   But even with those quibbles, Batman Begins was a total eye-opener, a
   whole new vision of what a superhero movie could even be. Nolan has
   always had a way with mythic images, and some of the individual shots
   from Batman Begins will be with me forever: the taser harmlessly
   sparking off of Batman’s armor, or the bit where a helicopter camera
   swoops around Batman as he perches like a gargoyle on a Gotham spire.
   Nolan knew that just a little bit of veracity could go a long way. He
   knew that he could make Gotham look, more or less, like a real city,
   rather than a German-expressionist fantasyland. He knew he could cover
   plot holes with a few quick lines about Bruce Wayne using shell
   companies to buy his Batsuit’s components. And he knew that, with just
   a little bit of elbow grease, he could send moviegoers—grown adults who
   should really know better—out of the theater talking about how his
   Batman movie was realistic. That was a new thing.

   Other notable 2005 superhero movies: Christopher Nolan might’ve made
   launching a new superhero franchise look like an easy thing, but it’s
   apparently not that easy. Consider Tim Story’s first Fantastic Four
   movie, in which Marvel’s beloved interstellar-adventurer family comes
   to life in an incoherent flurry of bad jokes and worse CGI. The movie
   gave Chris Evans, then playing Johnny Storm, an early chance to flex
   his charm. But other than that, it’s a worthless,
   intelligence-insulting mess—exactly the sort of movie that, in its pure
   shittiness, underscores just how miraculous Batman Begins really was.

   It’s kind of a mess, but Francis Lawrence’s Constantine, based on a
   character that Alan Moore created, does a much better job at building a
   whole world and giving its hero some gravitas. As John Constantine,
   Keanu Reeves, in that weird career valley between the Matrix movies and
   John Wick, plays a sort of supernatural detective, hoping to cancel his
   own damnation by helping to keep the forces of Hell from overtaking
   Earth. It’s got the same overambitious plotting and bad CGI that plague
   so many of these movies, but it’s also got a great cast, including
   Tilda Swinton as a wayward angel and Shia LaBeouf as a Shia
   LaBeouf-esque loudmouth. (Also, Gavin Rossdale from Bush is in there?
   As a sexy demon?) And it takes its whole absurdity seriously.
   Constantine might also be the last big American studio movie to
   intentionally make smoking look cool. The cigarettes might be killing
   the main character, but he still gets to look cool while smoking them.
   (That same year, another Alan Moore story, the vaguely
   superhero-adjacent V For Vendetta, became a pretty okay movie.)

   For whatever reason, someone really thought that the bullshit-ass Ben
   Affleck Daredevil movie deserved a spinoff, and so we got Elektra. The
   movie isn’t nearly as bad as its reputation, and it’s sure as hell
   better than Daredevil. Elektra has some cool visual moments in with all
   the incoherent plotting, action, and CGI. But it does have the central
   problem of casting Jennifer Garner, a person who radiates niceness with
   every ounce of her being, as a cold-blooded ninja warrior. There are
   some problems you just can’t overcome.

   While superhero movies were becoming their own quasi-adult (or at least
   teenage) genre, 2005 did see the release of a few superhero movies for
   kids, like Sky High, the comedy about a school for teenage superheroes,
   or The Adventures Of Sharkboy And Lavagirl, Robert Rodriguez’s
   green-screen party about a kid whose superhero fantasies become
   reality. The Sci-Fi channel turned Man-Thing, Marvel’s tragic and
   silent swamp-monster hero, into a widely hated low-budget movie. Edward
   Furlong took over as the Crow in The Crow: Wicked Prayer, fighting
   David Boreanaz and Tara Reid and Tito Ortiz and Dennis Hopper in the
   character’s final straight-to-video movie. And Jamie Kennedy assumed
   the mantle of Jim Carrey in Son Of The Mask, a movie that I simply do
   not remember existing at all. Meanwhile, the non-superhero comics Sin
   City and A History Of Violence both became movies that were, in their
   own very different ways, iconic. I named my action-movie column after
   the latter, even though it wasn’t really an action movie.

   Next time: Bryan Singer tries to revive Richard Donner’s franchise with
   Superman Returns, and it goes badly in interesting ways.

   picks the most important superhero movie of every year, starting with
   the genre’s early big-budget moments and moving onto the
   multiplex-crushing monsters of today.

Batman (1989)

   For a little while there, people were shaving the Batman insignia into
   their hair. That’s the level of cultural dominance that Tim Burton’s
   Batman had going for it in the summer of 1989. Batman made a ton of
   money—over $400 million globally, in 1989 dollars—but that’s really
   only the half of it.

   People were so fired up about this movie that they wanted to become the
   movie somehow. Kids were quoting lines from the movie at each other on
   playgrounds before the movie had even come out, just from the TV
   commercials. Event movies arrive pretty routinely these days, but none
   of them feel like actual cultural events the way that Batman did. And
   as someone who was a kid at the time, I don’t even remember why.
   Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade made more money internationally that
   year, and I loved that movie, saw it twice in the theater. But it
   didn’t capture society’s imagination the same way, and it didn’t
   capture mine either.

   The funny thing about it—and now that I think about it, probably a big
   part of the reason for the excitement—was what a weird and personal
   movie Batman was. Burton didn’t grow up reading comic books, and so the
   Batman movie didn’t represent some childhood dream fulfilled for him.
   It was a job, a logical next step after he’d made visually distinctive
   hits out of Pee-wee’s Big Adventure and Beetlejuice. And yet Batman
   gave Burton a perfect excuse to go all the way big with his deeply
   inventive visual sensibility, to build a whole world out of it.

   In a lot of ways, Batman represents fairly pedestrian blockbuster
   filmmaking. The pacing is slow, the plotting occasionally incoherent.
   Too many of the action scenes are people wearing black clothes fighting
   in the dark, and you can’t see shit. There are plenty of sharp, fun
   character moments, but the movie still feels like it’s lumbering along
   to its inevitable explosive conclusion—a problem that’s haunted
   superhero movies ever since. But the thing that makes the movie stand
   out—the thing that all the critics at the time immediately commented
   on—was how the movie looked. Because no movie had ever really looked
   like that before.

   Burton’s version of Gotham City was a mad tangle of gothic
   architecture, a colossus designed by lunatics. Every building looms
   menacingly, and it’s hard to picture actual human beings living or
   working in any of those edifices. That works fine for Burton, who’s
   never, for the most part, been concerned with actual human beings.
   (That would change in Edward Scissorhands and Ed Wood, but looking at
   the now-vast Burton filmography, those are the exceptions.) In Batman,
   characters talk like they know they’re in a movie, and Burton
   obligingly throws noir shadows over their faces, making them look as
   filmic and unreal as possible. And Jack Nicholson’s Joker makeup moves
   things into a whole new dimension of unreality, especially during the
   scenes when his Joker wears flesh-toned face paint to falsely give the
   idea that he’s a normal person.

   Batman came after a period of great inventiveness within comics, with
   writers like Alan Moore and Frank Miller using old, familiar characters
   to tell heady, transgressive stories about darkness and obsession and
   evil. Moore and Brian Bolland’s Batman story The Killing Joke was a key
   influence, and Burton has said it was what woke him up to the creative
   possibilities in comic book stories. In that story, the Joker kidnaps,
   injures, and humiliates Chief Gordon’s daughter in the hope that it’ll
   help drag Gordon into insanity. Batman ultimately stops him, but not
   before making it clear that Batman himself shares a healthy dose of
   that insanity. Burton, in turn, makes Batman into a figure of darkness
   and obsession, one with no concern for his own safety or even
   happiness. And he turns the Joker into a cackling, nearly motiveless
   agent of chaos. “I am the world’s first fully functioning homicidal
   artist,” Joker brags at one point, clearly proud of himself. For a
   movie explicitly marketed to children, this was pretty heavy stuff.

   But Batman is still, in a lot of ways, a genuine kids’ movie. In the
   opening scene, Batman breaks up a robbery and scares a couple of
   bumbling central-casting mugs, and as visually striking as it may be,
   it’s also deeply hokey. While Michael Keaton knew how to hit
   intimidating Batman poses, the fights themselves weren’t too much more
   elaborate than what Adam West had done on the deliberately silly old
   Batman TV show. And it’s full of slapsticky visual jokes that, as an
   actual child, I thought were pretty funny; I loved when the Joker took
   down the Batwing by pulling a revolver with a four-foot barrel out of
   his pants.

   Burton gave Jack Nicholson top billing, and watching the movie today,
   this was the right call. Nicholson’s Joker suffers in comparison to the
   iconic Heath Ledger version that came along years later, but he still
   absolutely eats up the screen. Early on, as sneering gangster Jack
   Napier, Nicholson grounds the movie, giving it a palpable real-world
   menace; his icy physicality is perfect. (I always loved that
   screenwriters Sam Hamm and Warren Skaaren invented a character named
   Jack for Nicholson to play. It reminds me of all the movies where
   Jackie Chan plays a character named Jackie.)

   And as Joker, he does everything to not ground the movie, to push it
   into feverish insanity. He might rely on the frantic giggling a little
   too much, but the way he refuses to take the threat of Batman seriously
   is great. He’s in constant riff mode, but because it’s Nicholson, as
   opposed to someone like later riff-monster Batman villain Jim Carrey,
   the riffs carry a hint of menace and depravity. The scene in which the
   Joker and his boom-box goons invade an art museum and deface the
   paintings (a scene that Roger Ebert called “really vile”) is probably
   my favorite thing in the movie, mostly for the absurd chest-puffed
   dancing that the Joker does to Prince’s “Partyman.” (I also love the
   idea that the Joker used his crime-lord money to commission a Prince
   song about himself.)

   As Batman, Michael Keaton wasn’t the casting slam dunk that Nicholson
   was, but he’s a whole hell of a lot better than the two Batmen who
   would follow. When Keaton was first announced for the role, comic fans
   freaked out. Keaton was a former stand-up comic who’d really only been
   in comedies up to that point, so people assumed that Burton was going
   for the same sort of Bat-silliness as the Adam West show. And it’s true
   that Keaton isn’t remotely physically imposing, even in the Batman
   costume. But the confidence in his voice is great; as Batman, he lowers
   his voice without turning it into the death-metal whisper-growl that
   Christian Bale would later employ. As Bruce Wayne, meanwhile, he relies
   on an unforced natural charm without overdoing it. Burton’s clearly
   nowhere near as enamored of Batman as he is of the Joker, so Keaton
   doesn’t get as much to do. But Burton does get the idea that Batman
   himself is half a maniac. And when Keaton cuts loose in Vicki Vale’s
   apartment, reacting to the Joker’s menace with his own, Keaton at least
   gets to call back to the lunacy of Beetlejuice, a movie in which he’d
   been the Joker figure.

   Really, all three of the central performances are crucial to Batman’s
   success. Kim Basinger’s Vicki Vale is an underwritten part, but
   Basinger holds the movie together by coming across as the only halfway
   genuine human being in it. She reacts to all the insanity around her by
   projecting both trepidation and intrigue. And she sells the idea that
   she’s falling in love with squirrely-looking Keaton, which is just good
   acting. The entire movie hinges on the idea of the Joker seeing a photo
   of Vale and becoming obsessed. It’s a stretch, but it’s Kim Basinger,
   so you halfway buy it. “It’s as though we were made for each other:
   beauty and the beast,” he tells her. “Of course, if anyone else calls
   you beast, I’ll rip their lungs out.”

   Other than those three, all the characters are pretty one-note, and
   they come across with varying degrees of success. I like Jack Palance’s
   glib crime lord, mostly because it’s Palance, and Billy Dee Williams’
   Lando-esque take on Harvey Dent, mostly because it’s Williams. I could
   do without Robert Wuhl’s motormouthed reporter, even though it’s fun to
   watch him spread the myth of Batman: “They say he can’t be killed! They
   say he drinks blood!” And Michael Gough’s fusty Alfred Pennyworth and
   Pat Hingle’s huffing Commissioner Gordon are total nonfactors in the
   movie.

   As an early stab at a comic book superhero movie, one made by someone
   who hadn’t previously been a comic book fan, Batman gets a lot wrong.
   The scene in which Alfred, who seems to desperately want his boss to
   settle down, shows Vale into the Batcave is maybe the movie’s single
   greatest miscalculation. And one of the central tropes of Batman
   stories is that Batman refuses to kill people, so it’s a bit jarring to
   see the Batmobile raid on the chemical plant, where Batman appears to
   kill goons with bombs. Still, this wasn’t a case of a paychecking
   director treating his material with contempt, something that we’d see a
   whole lot more often in later years. It’s a great director—well, an
   at-the-time great director—zeroing in on the parts of the mythos that
   he finds fascinating and building a world out of those. With Marvel all
   but forcing directorial anonymity on its movies, at least until the
   past year or so, it’s oddly thrilling to see a big-budget superhero
   movie that’s so clearly a single person’s vision.

   Other notable 1989 superhero movies: Marvel was a long way away from
   becoming a cinematic juggernaut in 1989, and the best it could do was
   to turn The Punisher into a cheesy ’80s action movie. The first of
   three big-screen Punisher adaptations, the 1989 version stars Dolph
   Lundgren as a version of Frank Castle who avenges his family by
   fighting both mobsters and ninjas. Lundgren’s dark hair dye, which
   looks fucking terrible, is the only real concession to the comic book
   version of the story; Lundgren never even wears the iconic Punisher
   skull. But as a cheesy ’80s action movie, it’s pretty fun. I can’t hate
   a movie in which a gang of ninjas attacks the hero by zooming down an
   enormous funhouse slide.

   1989 also saw the release of the deeply silly sequel The Return Of The
   Swamp Thing, which ditched most of Wes Craven’s horror elements to tell
   a story about the Swamp Thing taking on an army of genetic-monster
   Un-Men. It’s a movie in which Heather Locklear falls in love with a
   giant plant-person, and the trailer includes the immortal line “He’s
   got a grudge because they turned him into sludge.”

   And speaking of genetic monsters, Troma made two different gory Z-grade
   Toxic Avenger sequels in 1989. In The Toxic Avenger Part II, Toxie
   visits Japan to gruesomely kill martial artists and take on an evil
   corporation. And in The Toxic Avenger Part III: The Last Temptation Of
   Toxie, Toxie takes a job as a spokesman for the evil corporation and
   ends up fighting Satan. Also, a school bus full of kids explodes.

   Next time: Twelve years before Spider-Man, Sam Raimi takes his first
   stab at telling a superhero story with 1990’s gloriously deranged
   Darkman.
