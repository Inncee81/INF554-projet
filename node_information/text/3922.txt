   The proportion of live births which occurred outside marriage in the EU
   stood at 43 % in 2016. This is just over 15 percentage points above the
   value in 2000. From 2000 the share steadily increased by around 1
   percentage point each year, signalling changing patterns of family
   formation, with births occurring in non-marital relationships,
   cohabiting couples and to lone parents.

   Births outside marriage EU 2016

   In eight EU Member States in 2016 there were more live births
   registered outside marriage than within marriage: France (60 %),
   Bulgaria and Slovenia (both 59 %), Estonia (56 %), Sweden (55 %),
   Denmark (54 %), Portugal (53 %) and the Netherlands (50 %). In
   contrast, more than 80 % of live births in Greece, Croatia and Cyprus
   were registered within marriage. Between 2015 and 2016, extramarital
   births increased in almost every EU Member State with the exception of
   Estonia, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary and the United Kingdom. In
   Bulgaria and Ireland there was no variation. In the EFTA countries
   Switzerland and Liechtenstein, the proportion of births outside
   marriage in 2016 was below 25%, in contrast to Norway (56%) and Iceland
   (70%).

Women in EU parliament and governments

   Women held 30% of seats in national parliaments in the EU in 2018. This
   share has increased since 2003, when women accounted for about
   one-fifth (21%) of members in national parliaments.

   However, the share of men in national parliaments is still considerably
   higher across the EU as a whole. No EU country had more women than men
   holding seats in parliament.

   The share of seats held by women in national parliaments varies
   considerably between EU countries. In 2018, Sweden had the highest
   share of women in its national parliament with 47%. Sweden was
   followed by Finland (42%), Belgium and Spain (both 40%). A significant
   number of women also held seats in Austria (37%), Denmark and  Portugal
   (both 36%) and Italy (35%).

   At the opposite end of the scale, women account for less than one-fifth
   of the national parliament members in Hungary (13%), Malta (15%),
   Cyprus and Greece (18%) and Romania (20%).


   Seats held by women in national parliaments, 2018

   The source dataset is accessible here.


   The share of female members of government (senior and junior ministers)
   in the EU increased from 23% in 2003 to 30% in 2018.

   In 2018, the largest share of female members of government was recorded
   in Spain and Sweden (52%), followed by France (49%), the Netherlands
   (42%) and Denmark (41%).

   At the bottom end of the scale, women accounted for less than one fifth
   of members of the government in Hungary (7%), Malta (12%), Cyprus,
   Italy and Poland (17.0%).

   The number of female presidents and prime ministers in EU countries
   also rose over the period 2003 – 2018. In 2018, there were three female
   heads of government (11 %) whereas there were none in 2003. However,
   during this 15 year period, the share of female heads of government in
   the EU never exceeded 14%, meaning there were never more than four
   women in this position at the same time.

   The source dataset is accessible here.


   A national parliament is the national legislative assembly. The
   indicator refers to both chambers (lower and upper house, where
   relevant). Included are also the president/speaker/leader of the
   parliament.

   The national government is the executive body with authority to govern
   a country or a state. Members of government include both senior
   ministers (who sit in the cabinet or council of ministers, including
   the prime minister) and junior ministers. Some countries count
   state-secretaries (or the national equivalent) as junior ministers
   within the government but in others, they are not considered members of
   government.

   JRC scientists have examined the impact of seafood supply chains across
   national boundaries - the global seafood consumption footprint.
     * Global seafood consumption has more than doubled in the past 50
       years, putting stress on the sustainability of fishing
     * Net importing nations must consider the sustainability of their
       trading partners' fishing practices, not just their domestic ones
     * New analysis on international supply chains makes the case for
       international collaboration on long-term sustainability of all
       seafood production

   Taking into consideration both food that humans consume and seafood
   processed for feed production, seafood consumption in EU member states
   equals 27 kg per head.

   The highest consumption at EU level is observed in Portugal (61.5 kg
   per head) while outside the EU, the top consumers are Korea (78.5 kg
   per head) followed by Norway (66.6 kg per head).

   The global per head consumption is estimated at 22.3 kg.

Global demand for seafood is growing

   Global seafood consumption has more than doubled in the past 50 years,
   to over 20 kg per capita per year in 2014.

   As demand for seafood rises, the sustainability of fish stock becomes
   an ever more pressing issue.

   Compared to other commodities, the share of globally produced seafood
   products that are traded internationally is very high and growing,
   mostly due to globalisation and the geographical discrepancy between
   aquaculture production happening mostly in Asia, and seafood demand
   mostly in Europe, North America and Asia.

   Given that many nations rely on imports to meet national demands,
   assessments of the sustainability of seafood need to consider both
   domestic production and net imports, and whether imported seafood comes
   from sustainable sources.

Why measure global seafood consumption footprint?

   In a recent article "Global seafood consumption footprint", JRC
   scientists use a new methodology to examine the impact of seafood
   supply chains across national boundaries - the global seafood
   consumption footprint.

   This is the first ever measure of national footprints based on seafood
   consumption rather than production, broken down by sector to quantify
   the dependencies between capture fisheries and aquaculture through
   fishmeal production and trade by country.

   The seafood consumption footprint provides policy-makers with evidence
   to encourage international collaboration and promote policies to ensure
   long-term sustainability of all seafood production.

What is our global seafood consumption footprint?

   According to calculations using baseline data from 2011, global demand
   for seafood destined for human consumption is 143.8 million tonnes per
   year, and the overall consumption footprint, which also includes other
   uses of seafood, is 154 million tonnes.

   China has by far the largest seafood consumption footprint (65 million
   tonnes), followed by the European Union (13 million tonnes), Japan (7.4
   million tonnes), Indonesia (7.3 tonnes) and the United States (7.1
   million tonnes).

   In terms of consumption footprint per capita, the Republic of Korea
   scored highest (78.5 kg per capita), followed by Norway (66.6 kg),
   Portugal (61.5 kg), Myanmar (59.9 kg), Malaysia (58.6 kg) and Japan (58
   kg) – China comes in seventh at 48.3 kg per capita.

How to measure global seafood consumption footprint

   JRC scientists developed a model (Multi-Region Input-Output, MRIO) for
   the world seafood supply chain to investigate the impact of seafood
   consumption across national boundaries.

   The model explores the interactions between capture fisheries and
   aquaculture, fishmeal and trade at the global level, and accounts for
   trade flows and interdependencies between different countries along the
   international supply chain, linking the extraction of raw materials,
   inter-industry flow, trade and final consumption.

   Results from the model can provide policy-makers and consumers with
   information on the extent of reliance on producer nations for their
   seafood supplies.

   They can support the assessment on whether seafood sources are
   exploited in accordance with the applicable or desired sustainability
   standards and objectives.

   This information can help encourage international collaboration and
   promote policies to ensure long-term sustainability of all seafood
   production.

EU policies to preserve fish stocks

   The Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) is a set of rules for managing
   European fishing fleets and for conserving fish stocks.

   Stocks may be renewable, but they are finite. Some of these fishing
   stocks, however, are being overfished.

   As a result, EU countries have taken action to ensure the European
   fishing industry is sustainable and does not threaten the fish
   population size and productivity over the long term.

   As a major fishing power, and the largest single market for fisheries
   products in the world, the EU also plays an important role in promoting
   better governance through a number of international organisations.

   This involves developing and implementing policy on fisheries
   management and – more generally – the Law of the Sea.

   The EU works closely with its partners from around the globe through
   the United Nations system, including the Food and Agriculture
   Organisation (FAO), as well as in other bodies, such as the
   Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
