   Mobile point-of-sale and payments company SumUp recently raised a big
   round of Series B funding from Groupon and American Express to
   accelerate its growth and continue to differentiate itself from its
   European rivals iZettle and payleven.

   Today, the company announced that it is expanding the Series B round
   with a strategic investment from BBVA Ventures, the corporate venture
   arm of multinational banking group BBVA.

   Banco Santander, the largest bank in the Eurozone, recently pumped more
   than $6.6 million into iZettle in a similar move.

   The investment from BBVA, which has Spanish roots dating all the way
   back to 1857, will serve to help SumUp establish a stronger position in
   Spain and Portugal – where the startup is already present – and expand
   its availability to South America down the line.

   With headquarters in Bilbao, Spain, BBVA provides financial services in
   more than 30 countries and has emerged as one of the leading players in
   South America. Its investment arm has $100 million to back financial
   service startups from all over the globe.

   SumUp declined to disclose the exact size of BBVA Ventures’ investment
   beyond that it is a continuation of the Series B round.

   The startup’s co-founder, Jan Deepen, who is responsible for its
   international expansion, comments:

     We are delighted to bring on BBVA Ventures as a new financial
     investor. International expansion is a key component of our growth
     story. Having BBVA as a strong partner at our side as we expand to
     regions beyond Europe – in particular South America – is invaluable.

   SumUp helps merchants accept debit and credit card payments from
   customers with their smartphones and tablets. At present, SumUp only
   supports payments via Visa and MasterCard.

   The fresh cash will also be used to hammer out its end-to-end payment
   solution, which encompasses a certified payments gateway as well as
   proprietary terminal hardware and operations systems.

   The previously-announced Series B financing round follows another
   ‘double-digit million Euro’ (reportedly $20+ million) Series A round
   closed in the second quarter of 2012, from b-to-v Partners, Shortcut
   Ventures, Tengelmann Ventures and a group of business angels.

   SumUp was founded in 2011 by Deepen, Daniel Klein, Petter Made, Stefan
   Jeschonnek and Marc-Alexander Christ. The company currently boasts
   major offices in Berlin, London, Dublin, Madrid, Milan and Moscow.

   Its services are currently available in European countries such as
   Germany, UK, Ireland, Spain, Italy, Austria, the Netherlands, Belgium,
   Portugal, France and Russia, but you’ll likely find some South American
   countries in that particular list in the near future.

SumUp demos its latest mobile-payments tech for Europe: Order a coffee simply

   The Next Web was out and about at Finovate Europe this week, a 2-day
   London conference showcasing the future of financial and banking
   technology.

   One of the companies we met up with was SumUp, a Berlin-based firm that
   we last caught up with back in November, when it launched an API for
   developers to add payment functionality to their apps.

How will blockchain impact finance and business?

   Find out at TNW’s Hard Fork Summit
   Take me there

   In a nutshell, SumUp brings Square-like technology to merchants in
   Europe, letting them easily accept debit and credit payments via their
   smartphone or tablet. This is all enabled via a little card reader that
   attaches to, say, a coffee shop-owner’s iPad.

   Indeed, we’ve previously written that Europe is becoming something of a
   hotbed for Square-style services, with the likes of iZettle (more here)
   and Rocket Internet’s Payleven (see previous coverage) all vying for a
   slice of the pie.

SumUp Pay: Hands-free purchasing

   So how is SumUp setting its up its stall for the long haul? Well, with
   SumUp Pay for starters.

   While the young startup did try to distance itself from
   Square-comparisons for various reasons, SumUp Pay essentially brings
   Square Wallet-functionality to its existing offering, letting consumers
   download an app, link their credit card and pre-approve a particular
   establishment (coffee house, clothes shop etc) that’s already signed up
   to the existing merchant-focused service. This means a user doesn’t
   even have to take their phone or wallet out their pockets to place an
   order.

   Say wha’?

   Thanks to the wonders of geo-fencing, the second a consumer walks in to
   order a latte, the server will see a photo of the customer pop up in
   front of them, with their name and notes of what they usually like to
   order too. It’s all done hands-free, with nothing more than
   name-confirmation and chit-chat required to seal the deal.

   As soon as payment has been made, a receipt is sent automatically to
   the customer’s phone. It also goes without saying that this will only
   be applicable to smaller-valued items such as coffee and cakes – you’ll
   not be able to buy a leather sofa using this.

   SumUp Pay

   At Finovate Europe this week, SumUp gave TNW a sneak peek of SumUp Pay,
   and while it was only a demo, it was clear to see what they’re striving
   for with this. And the key buzzword here is frictionless.

   It’s still in closed alpha for now, but when it launches later this
   year, it should go some way towards streamlining the checkout process.
   While specific alpha clients weren’t discussed, if this was rolled out
   in a large coffee shop chain, it would significantly speed up the
   ordering process – no fumbling around for cards. And even if NFC does
   finally emerge to realize some of its potential, there’s still the
   iPhone obstacle to consider. For SumUp Pay to work from the consumer’s
   perspective, all that’s needed is a smartphone and an app.

   The benefit here runs two-fold. SumUp already has “tens of thousands”
   of merchants signed up to its existing card-reader model, and that’s
   half the battle in terms of getting SumUp Pay off the ground – it’s
   integrated directly into the existing set-up. And for the consumer,
   well, it gives them another option to pay.

   There’s a lot of interesting stuff going on in the financial technology
   space at the moment, and it will be interesting to see how things pan
   out over the next twelve months and beyond. And we’ll be sure to
   revisit SumUp Pay as it nears a full public launch.

   Meanwhile, you can see all our coverage from Finovate Europe here.

   SumUp provides a way for merchants to take debit and credit payments
   via their smartphone and today, the company has launched an API for its
   mobile point-of-sale solution.

   The API is available for both iOS and Android and the company hopes
   that this will help businesses and developers bring payment processing
   functions to their own apps. The system works with credit and debit
   cards issued by MasterCard and Visa as well as registering cash
   payments.

   It seems that it is payment-alternative week this week as iZettle
   launched in the UK, Payleven announced its Chip & Pin mobile solution
   at London’s App World conference, India’s Ezetap landed $3.5 million in
   Series A funding and MasterCard and ING started testing their mobile
   payment system in the Netherlands. It seems that we may be seeing more
   mobile attachments for card payments and even though Square is working
   on raising its profile via its deal with Starbucks will have more than
   a little to think about when it comes to competition.

   SumUP CEO, Daniel Klein mobile feels that tech is changing the way
   merchants and their customers consider payments. He says:

     “More merchants than ever before are using mobile technology to
     engage with their customers. Unfortunately, until now a lot of them
     have had to stop short of actually taking payments through their
     apps as they haven’t had access to the secure technology and
     know-how needed to do so. The release of our API means that this
     issue is solved.  They can now boost the potential of their apps by
     accepting payments seamlessly and securely, even on-the-go.”

   The launch of the API follows SumUp’s completion of a $20 million
   series A round of funding so it is clear the money is being put to good
   use. Those who are interested in taking a closer look can find details
   about the API here.

   SumUp was founded in 2011 and has expanded quickly. The company
   currently employs over 130 people and has offices in Berlin, London and
   Dublin.

   TNW’s Managing Editor, Martin Bryant caught up with SumUp’s co-founder
   and COO, Petter Made at the Dublin Web Summit recently and you can find
   out his thoughts on the European mobile payments market in this video.

How do you stand out in the fierce ‘European Square clone’ market? We ask

   Europe is proving a competitive market for Square-style services that
   let merchants take payments with mobile devices. iZettle, SumUp and
   Rocket Internet’s Payleven are all vying to grab a slice of the market.

   So, how can one company stand out – especially when Square itself is
   starting to expand beyond the States and must surely have Europe near
   the top of its ‘to-do’ list?

   At the Dublin Web Summit, I caught up with SumUp’s co-founder and COO,
   Petter Made, to find out how this Ireland-based service plans to take
   on its rivals who – let’s face it – all do very similar things.

Tumblr traffic dropped by nearly 100M views the month after it banned porn

   Tumblr’s ban on adult content is costing it dearly.

   In December, we reported on news of Tumblr invoking the nuclear option
   and banning pornography and other adult content from the popular
   blogging platform. A month later, it had lost more than 100 million
   views — a 17 percent decline in just 30 days.

Have you heard of Hard Fork Summit?

   TNW’s finance, blockchain, and business event is coming up soon
   Find out more

   According to data from web analytics firm SimilarWeb, Tumblr’s problems
   started, predictably, with its adult content ban. In December, it was
   flying high, with approximately 521 million pageviews that month. 30
   days later, that had dropped to just 437 million.

   We can’t say we didn’t warn you.

   We wrote about the ramifications of Tumblr’s decision not once, not
   twice, but thrice — pointing out that Tumblr’s users would flee to
   greener pastures, that its ban was breaking up safe spaces for women
   and other marginalized communities, and that the language in its ban
   was inherently sexist.

   What’s a female-presenting nipple, anyway?

   For Tumblr, the decision was a knee-jerk reaction to its temporary
   takedown from Apple’s App Store after engineers discovered child
   pornography on the website.

   Initially Tumblr remained mum, commenting last year that it was
   “working to resolve the issue with the iOS app.” That was until
   Download.com approached the Yahoo-owned website with sources who
   claimed the app’s removal was due to child pornography. Tumblr then
   confirmed the story, worked with Apple to remove the offensive content,
   and then returned to the App Store before the end of 2018.

   In a statement, Tumblr said:

     We’re committed to helping build a safe online environment for all
     users, and we have a zero tolerance policy when it comes to media
     featuring child sexual exploitation and abuse. As this is an
     industry-wide problem, we work collaboratively with our industry
     peers and partners like the National Center for Missing and
     Exploited Children (NCMEC) to actively monitor content uploaded to
     the platform. Every image uploaded to Tumblr is scanned against an
     industry database of known child sexual abuse material, and images
     that are detected never reach the platform.

   Rather than just ridding the site of its offensive content, however,
   Tumblr elected to blow the whole thing up and start over, this time as
   a PG-13 version of its former self. Like most online platforms, Tumblr
   has had its issues with unsavory content — but no more than YouTube,
   Facebook, Twitter, and any other place where humans congregate. The
   site wasn’t promoting child pornography, and it certainly didn’t
   approve. Its terms of service prohibited exploitative images of minors,
   and the team worked promptly to remove them once discovered.

   And while it’s clear that Tumblr needed to take steps to eradicate its
   platform from sexual images of child exploitation, it’s hard to find
   anyone who argued in favor of it going this far.

   For adult content enthusiasts, Tumblr was a place to let their freak
   flag fly. Like-minded individuals, including those from the LGBTQ
   community, found a a place they belonged, bonding over a shared love of
   kink in carefully-curated communities. And now it’s gone.

   If it’s any consolation, Tumblr is feeling it too.
