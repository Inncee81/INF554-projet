Mike

   Director

   "The longer you're here, and the more you build, and the more you
   collaborate, the more you become personally passionate about our
   mission," says Mike Bundy, who started out in a temp job stacking
   pallets at Amazon's first fulfillment center in 1997. Today, he manages
   a 300-person software organization. "I feel like a founder of the
   company. I feel a great deal of personal pride in what we’ve done."

   In his fulfillment center days, when Amazon still had a lot of
   technological growing pains, Mike was always the guy popping into the
   tech room to ask, "How can we help?" His curiosity and commitment led
   to relationships with mentors who helped him follow his newfound
   passion and transform himself from an art-school grad into a leader of
   projects that truly reinvent the customer experience.

   It's easy to forget these days, but there was a time when Amazon didn't
   – and couldn't – promise that an order would arrive by a certain date.
   Mike helped change that. "We totally overhauled the way we make
   promises on the website," he says. "We got rid of the 'usually ships in
   24 hours' messaging. We developed the capability to make these
   aggressive delivery estimates and keep them. In many ways, this was
   what Prime was born of."

   By the end of 2011, Mike got promoted to the role of director and
   managed a team working on software for Amazon's fulfillment centers,
   the state-of-the-art versions of where Mike first worked. "So for me,
   that was like coming back to where I started," he says. "It was super
   exciting."

   One of Mike's Amazon mentors taught him that "the bottom line is total
   ownership. There is no problem you don't own, and you've got to dive
   deep on them all, and you've got to move really fast."

   For Mike, who got married and became a dad during his almost two
   decades at Amazon, ownership isn't just about getting work done; it's
   about leaving work behind and recharging with family. "I manage my
   schedule really aggressively," he says. "If you let your calendar get
   filled up with non-essential stuff, you're not owning your career, and
   you're not owning your path. You can be scrappy. You can be
   entrepreneurial. You don't have to give up your personal life."
