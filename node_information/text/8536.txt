Correction: Brazil-Environment story

   August 30, 2019

   RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — In a story Aug. 6 about deforestation in the
   Amazon, The Associated Press reported erroneously that the Amazon
   produces nearly 20% of the earth’s atmosphere. Scientists say it
   produces far less than that.

   A corrected version of the story is below:

   Latest deforestation data in Brazil show significant surge

   New data from the Brazilian space research institute indicates a surge
   in deforestation in the Amazon in the last quarter

   By DIANE JEANTET

   Associated Press

   RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — New data from the Brazilian space institute
   published Tuesday point to a surge in deforestation in the Amazon in
   the last quarter, fueling fears that President Jair Bolsonaro’s
   pro-agribusiness policies will accelerate deforestation.

   Figures of the National Institute for Space Research, a federal agency,
   show that more forest was lost between May and July this year than
   during the same period in 2018, 2017 and 2016. In July alone, the
   rainforest lost 2,254 square kilometers (870 square miles) of
   vegetation, between three and five times the surfaces lost the same
   month in the past four years.

   This is the biggest surge in deforestation rates since the institute
   adopted its current methodology in 2014.

   Brazil contains about 60 percent of the Amazon rainforest, a key
   regulator in the planet’s living systems. Its trees take in as much as
   2 billion tons of carbon dioxide every year.

   Brazil was once heralded as a global environmental success story. But
   some fear increasing deforestation will accelerate under Bolsonaro, a
   climate change skeptic with a strongly pro-agribusiness agenda.

   “This is a very serious setback,” said Malu Ribeiro, a project
   coordinator at SOS Mata Atlantica, a nonprofit organization whose work
   focuses on another endangered area, Brazil’s Atlantic Forest.

   Ribeiro criticized the way the government has been imposing its
   environmental agenda. “They are trying to forcefully implement an
   agenda of deconstruction, of deregulation, with total disrespect for
   institutions, or science,” Ribeiro said. “Since the (end of the
   military regime), in 1985, we’d never seen anything like it.”

   On the campaign trail, Bolsonaro vowed to help mining and agribusiness
   companies expand their activities in environmentally protected areas,
   including the Amazon. Since he was sworn into office on Jan. 1, he has
   shown on multiple occasions that he will stick to his campaign
   promises.

   He appointed a like-minded environment minister, Ricardo Salles, who
   was found guilty of modifying an environmental protection plan
   surrounding a river basin to favor mining groups when he was Secretary
   of Environment for Sao Paulo state between 2016 and 2018.

   Over the past seven months, Bolsonaro and Salles have worked to weaken
   environmental legislation. The president has passed a decree to cut the
   size of the National Council of the Environment from 100 to 21 members
   and has attempted to transfer the responsibility for delineating
   indigenous territories from the Justice Ministry to the Agriculture
   Ministry, which one lawmaker described as “letting the fox take over
   the chicken coop.” Bolsonaro also said he was working on a proposal to
   regularize illegal mining in protected areas.

   Salles has publicly questioned the efficiency of the Amazon Fund, which
   allocates money to projects working to contain deforestation in the
   Amazon, leading its two major donors, Germany and Norway, to consider
   pulling out of the program altogether, Brazilian media reported.

   Recently, the president of the institute that publishes deforestation
   data left his post after Bolsonaro questioned his integrity as well as
   the veracity of the federal agency’s reports that showed a sharp
   increase in deforestation.

   At a press conference, Bolsonaro said he suspected agency officials of
   manipulating figures to make his administration look bad. Scientists
   and academics have come out in support of the institute and its former
   president, which have denied the accusations.

   During a recent public appearance, Bolsonaro joked that if the “absurd”
   deforestation numbers were true, “then I am Captain Chainsaw!”

   The data was produced by a monitoring system called DETER, which has
   been producing daily alerts on deforestation based on satellite images
   since 2004.

   The government also uses another satellite imaging system to monitor
   the Amazon rainforest, PRODES, in place since the early 1980s. It works
   with higher resolution images but only produces a single report every
   year, which prompted officials to launch a faster system, DETER, to
   strengthen surveillance and sanctions in the vast Amazon.

After delays, Egypt’s new mega-museum set to open in 2020

   CAIRO (AP) &#8212; On the Giza Plateau outside Cairo, thousands of
   Egyptians are laboring in the shadow of the pyramids to erect a
   monument worthy of the pharaohs.

   The Grand Egyptian Museum has been under construction for well over a
   decade and is intended to showcase Egypt’s ancient treasures while
   drawing tourists to help fund its future development. But the project
   has been subject to repeated delays, with a “soft opening” planned for
   next year scrapped in favor of a more triumphant inauguration in 2020.
   Costs have meanwhile soared from an initial $650 million to well over
   $1 billion, with most of the financing coming from Japan.

   It’s the latest mega-project to be championed by President Abdel-Fattah
   el-Sissi, who is wagering that massive investments in infrastructure
   will revive an economy weakened by decades of stagnation and battered
   by the unrest that followed the 2011 uprising.

   The museum is a series of towering concrete halls that will eventually
   hold some 50,000 artifacts, including the famed mask of Tutankhamen
   &#8212; popularly known as King Tut &#8212; and other treasures
   currently housed in the century-old Egyptian Museum in Cairo’s
   congested Tahrir Square. The hope is that tourists will stay awhile,
   and provide the foreign currency Egypt needs to buttress its economy.

   “It’s a place where you can linger to enjoy ancient Egypt,” project
   director Tarek Tawfik said on a recent tour of the site, which will
   also include a conference center, a cinema, 28 shops, 10 restaurants
   and a boutique hotel. Giant windows open onto the 5,000-year-old
   pyramids, and the museum will feature an intact wooden ship and a
   towering statue of Ramses II.

   Tawfik describes it as “a fantastic experience of ancient Egypt in a
   very modern building that provides all kind of modern, comfortable
   functions.”

   That would mark a major change from the current setup, in which
   tourists visiting the pyramids and the Sphinx are routinely hassled by
   touts and camel-drivers.

   Tourists are gradually returning to Egypt, but the industry has yet to
   recover from the 2011 uprising, which toppled longtime autocrat Hosni
   Mubarak and ushered in a period of instability, culminating in the
   military overthrow of the country’s first freely elected president, an
   Islamist whose brief rule sparked mass protests.

   El-Sissi, who led the overthrow of Mohammed Morsi in 2013 and was
   elected the following year, has presided over an unprecedented
   crackdown on dissent. Political demonstrations, heavily restricted
   under a 2013 law, are now unheard of. A Sinai-based insurgency that
   gathered steam after Morsi’s overthrow has carried out a series of
   attacks in recent years, mainly on security forces and Christians, but
   has only rarely targeted foreign tourists.

   El-Sissi has meanwhile sought to use large-scale projects to bolster
   the image of the state &#8212; with mixed results. A trumpeted
   expansion of the Suez Canal in 2015 has yet to deliver the soaring
   revenues the government promised, as global trade has eased. A
   grandiose new administrative capital under construction outside Cairo
   is still in the early stages, with negligible foreign investment and
   foreign embassies not keen to move so far out into the desert.

   Egypt’s pharaonic heritage remains a major draw, however, and Tawfik
   expects the museum to attract 8 million people a year once it opens. An
   estimated 8 million tourists will have visited Egypt in 2018, an
   increase from previous years but well below a peak of 14.7 million
   before the 2011 uprising.

   Egypt’s multi-national construction giant Orascom built the museum,
   with initial loans from the Japanese government of $320 million in 2006
   and $450 million in 2016. The Japanese continue to advise on the
   museum’s development and artifact restoration, but it is unclear who
   will provide the additional financing for the project, with costs now
   estimated at $1.1 billion. A bidding process is underway to find
   someone to operate the site.

   Much of the financing may end up coming from the military or affiliated
   companies, which play a major role in the economy and have been heavily
   involved in other mega-projects. The Associated Press spent several
   weeks seeking permission to visit the museum, which was ultimately
   granted by the military.

   Tawfik said the military is helping with “value engineering” &#8212;
   the sourcing of local components like stone cladding and materials to
   reduce reliance on more expensive imports. Egypt floated its currency
   in 2016 in order to secure a bailout from the International Monetary
   Fund, leading to a devaluation that has taken a heavy toll on poor and
   middle-class Egyptians.

   “Today, despite all the increases in costs and the floating of the
   Egyptian pound, it’s quite amazing that the project will be completed,
   thanks to good management and value engineering,” he said.

   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) &#8212; A dead whale that washed ashore in
   eastern Indonesia had a large lump of plastic waste in its stomach,
   including drinking cups, bottles and flip-flops, a park official said
   Tuesday, causing concern among environmentalists and government
   officials in one of the world’s largest plastic-polluting countries.

   Rescuers from Wakatobi National Park found the rotting carcass of the
   9.5-meter (31-foot) sperm whale late Monday near the park in Southeast
   Sulawesi province after hearing that villagers were beginning to
   butcher the rotting carcass, park chief Heri Santoso said.

   Santoso said researchers from wildlife conservation group WWF and the
   park’s conservation academy found about 5.9 kilograms (13 pounds) of
   plastic waste in the animal’s stomach containing 115 plastic cups, four
   plastic bottles, 25 plastic bags, 2 flip-flops, a nylon sack and more
   than 1,000 other assorted pieces of plastic.

   “Although we have not been able to deduce the cause of death, the facts
   that we see are truly awful,” said Dwi Suprapti, a marine species
   conservation coordinator at WWF Indonesia.

   She said it was not possible to determine if the plastic had caused the
   whale’s death because of the animal’s advanced state of decay.

   Indonesia, an archipelago of 260 million people, is the world’s
   second-largest plastic polluter after China, according to a study
   published in the journal Science in January. It produces 3.2 million
   tons of mismanaged plastic waste a year, of which 1.29 million tons
   ends up in the ocean, the study said.

   Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, Indonesia’s coordinating minister of maritime
   affairs, said the whale’s discovery should raise public awareness about
   the need to reduce plastic use, and had spurred the government to take
   tougher measures to protect the ocean.

   “I’m so sad to hear this,” said Pandjaitan, who recently has campaigned
   for less use of plastic. “It is possible that many other marine animals
   are also contaminated with plastic waste and this is very dangerous for
   our lives.”

   He said the government is making efforts to reduce the use of plastic,
   including urging shops not to provide plastic bags for customers and
   teaching about the problem in schools nationwide to meet a government
   target of reducing plastic use by 70 percent by 2025.

   “This big ambition can be achieved if people learn to understand that
   plastic waste is a common enemy,” he told The Associated Press.
