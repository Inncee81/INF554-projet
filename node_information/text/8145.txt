Thirsty Food

   Fueling Agriculture to Fuel Humans

   Of the less than 1 percent of freshwater available for human use, a
   whopping 70 percent goes toward growing food and raising animals.

   Your diet is probably the biggest slice of your water footprint,
   especially if you eat meat from cows and other animals fed with
   water-intensive crops, such as corn. Cutting consumption of animal
   products in half would reduce the U.S.’s dietary requirements of water
   by 37 percent. The average U.S. diet currently takes 1,320 gallons
   (4,997 liters) of water a day to produce.

   Food is also a means by which water is moved, or imported and exported,
   around the world. You may find that the rice you bought today was grown
   in a dry region of Jordan with the help of highly engineered, but not
   always very efficient, irrigation systems. For example, northern China
   annually exports to south China about 1.8 trillion cubic feet (52
   billion cubic meters) of water indirectly through foodstuffs and other
   products.

   In areas where food is not taken for granted—often the same areas where
   droughts and flooding hit the hardest—there are 850 million people
   annually suffering from malnutrition. As water becomes less accessible,
   so does food.
   NG Live!: Sandra Postel: Troubled Waters

   National Geographic Fellow Sandra Postel views the world through a
   water lens, advocating for all to make simple and easy changes to their
   everyday lives that will help "Change the Course" of the Earth's
   precious supply of freshwater.

   The National Geographic Live! series brings thought-provoking
   presentations by today’s leading explorers, scientists, photographers,
   and performing artists right to your YouTube feed. Each presentation is
   filmed in front of a live audience at National Geographic headquarters
   in Washington, D.C. New clips air every Monday.

Fast Facts

     * More efficient irrigation practices, such as drip and
       micro-sprinklers, can reduce the volume of water applied to
       agricultural fields by 30-70 percent and can increase crop yields
       by 20-90 percent.

     * Drip irrigation is used on less than 2 percent of irrigated land
       worldwide.

     * Reducing U.S. irrigation demands by even 10 percent could free up
       enough freshwater to meet the new urban and industrial water
       demands anticipated for 2025.
