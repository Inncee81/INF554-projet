Hello!

I'm Karin

   Truncation means to remove the excess until you are only left with what
   really matters. In this space, I'm working on applying this concept to
   my wardrobe by practicing intentionality not only in how I shop, but in
   where I shop. In other words, this isn't your typical fashion blog.

   (4!!) loves. I’m tired, but I’m just absolutely loving these first few
   days with Gabe. After having such a hard and traumatic first few months
   with Ella and Rosie this feels like such a healing experience. I love
   how our family has come together bit by bit. Also side note: can we
   just take a moment to appreciate Kit’s budding fashion sense?

   to the Dr. today proved my theory that one newborn is a whole lot

Hello!

I'm Karin

   Truncation means to remove the excess until you are only left with what
   really matters. In this space, I'm working on applying this concept to
   my wardrobe by practicing intentionality not only in how I shop, but in
   where I shop. In other words, this isn't your typical fashion blog.
   Join me on this journey!

   This is my last preschedule outfit roundup that I have for you guys,
   and I'm assuming that by now the weather will have cooled down... but
   it's Minnesota so who knows. Ha! I'll for sure have one more post for
   you guys (what's in my hospital bag), but I may have one more depending

New in at Everlane: Sock Boots, Fleece, and Corduroy

   I'm going to keep this intro brief because I may go into labor at any
   point as I write this (if you're new to my blog, I'm 38.5 weeks
   pregnant with a baby boy), and I want to make sure I'm able to hit
   publish and get this into your hands. Why? There have been SO many good
   releases this month ...

   Instagram post 2143066314871173311_2109301417 First photo with my four
   (4!!) loves. I’m tired, but I’m just absolutely loving these first few
   days with Gabe. After having such a hard and traumatic first few months
   with Ella and Rosie this feels like such a healing experience. I love
   how our family has come together bit by bit. Also side note: can we
   just take a moment to appreciate Kit’s budding fashion sense?
