People Can't Tell If This Fenty Model Is Real Or Fake

   Shudu is the sci-fi creation of photographer Cameron-James Wilson.

   We've become so accustomed to filters and false realities on Instagram
   that it can become difficult to tell what's even real anymore. We'd
   like to think we still have a firm grip on reality, but an Instagram
   model named Shudu has just thrown our entire universe for a loop.

   A post shared by Shudu (@shudu.gram) on Nov 20, 2017 at 10:09am PST

   Shudu is an Instagram model with flawless dark skin. Her feed is
   scattered with various editorial images accompanied by #melanin
   hashtags. She even was reposted on Fenty Beauty's Instagram account,
   wearing the lipstick shade Saw-C. Her beauty is so striking and
   unfathomably perfect that you almost don't want to believe it's real.
   The thing is, it's not‚Äîshe's 100 percent CGI.

   "Basically Shudu is my creation, she‚Äôs my art piece that I am working
   on at moment," London-based photographer Cameron-James Wilson told
   BAZAAR.com. "She is not a real model unfortunately, but she represents
   a lot of the real models of today. There‚Äôs a big kind of movement with
   dark skin models, so she represents them and is inspired by them."

   Wilson was hesitant to confirm or deny Shudu's existence when we spoke
   with him on the phone this morning. After all, half the fun of creating
   art this life-like is to make the viewer reconsider their definition of
   reality. Her intent is not to fool or trick anyone, he says, but rather
   to be a beacon of inspiring beauty and creativity.

   "I use a 3D modeling program. It‚Äôs like virtual photography, so once I
   create her, I can kind of pose her in certain ways," Wilson explained.
   "I am a photographer anyway, so it‚Äôs just a way of exploring my
   creativity when I‚Äôm not shooting." A single image, like the one seen on
   Fenty's Instagram, takes several days to create.

   A post shared by Shudu (@shudu.gram) on Aug 27, 2017 at 11:07am PDT

   Shudu's striking beauty was actually inspired by a Barbie doll, called
   Princess of South Africa. "Obviously some models like Duckie were
   definitely big inspirations for her as well," revealed the
   photographer, who has also shot models like Gigi Hadid and Devon
   Windsor. It's worth noting that Fenty Beauty, who worked with Duckie on
   the brand's launch, only reposted the image of Shudu. We reached out
   for comment about whether or not they know about the model's
   computer-generated image.

   The technology is undeniably cool, but does Wilson feel any heat for
   creating a black model versus just shooting with a real one? "As a
   photographer, I work with lots of different people all the time, real
   people that have inspired her. At the end of the day, it's a way for me
   to express my creativity‚Äîit‚Äôs not trying to replace anyone. It's only
   trying to add to the kind of movement that's out there," he clarified.
   "It's meant to be beautiful art which empowers people. It‚Äôs not trying
   to take away an opportunity from anyone or replace anyone. She‚Äôs trying
   to complement those people."

   Only a handful of people have turned his work into something negative,
   while most understand his intention, he said. "I am just a creative
   person, and to me she is what the most beautiful woman in the world
   would look like."

   Shudu isn't the only computer-generated model on Instagram. Miquela,
   known as @LilMiquela, has 560,000+ followers who follow along as she
   models new clothes, takes selfies, and sells merch.

   In an era where Facetuning and digitally-altered photos are the norm
   across social platforms, Wilson said he's simply bringing fantasy to
   reality.

   "We live in such a filtered world now, where real is becoming fake. I
   wanted to create something that is fantasy toward becoming more real,
   and bringing it completely the other way."

Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan Officially Choose a Nanny for Baby Archie

   The Duke and Duchess of Sussex take on additional help as they prepare
   for a busy summer and fall tour.

   Frogmore Cottage is welcoming another new arrival. Prince Harry and
   Duchess Meghan have officially hired a nanny for baby Archie.

   Sources confirm to BAZAAR.com that the couple recently took on the
   extra pair of hands ahead of Harry‚Äôs busy summer schedule and Meghan
   planning a return to royal duties this fall.

   While the couple are hoping to keep personal details of the new staff
   member private, BAZAAR understands that the British-born female nanny
   is not permanently based at Frogmore Cottage or working weekends.

   ‚ÄúEver since Archie arrived they haven‚Äôt stopped smiling. The sleepless
   nights are totally worth it.‚Äù

   The additional support will come in particularly handy for the Sussexes
   when they tour Africa this October. Sources say it‚Äôs increasingly
   likely that Archie Mountbatten-Windsor will be joining them for the
   trip.

   Logistics for the overseas visit are still being ironed out, but if
   Archie joins, Prince Harry will take on a number of engagements by
   himself. Stops on the itinerary include Malawi, to focus on the
   expansion of his charity Sentebale, and Angola, where the government is
   about to provide $60 million to clear landmines from two national
   parks.

   Buckingham Palace won't release further details about the two-week trip
   until July, but engagements in Botswana and South Africa are also
   expected to be included on the schedule.

   Harry and Meghan‚Äôs new acquisition joins a long list of much-loved
   royal nannies. Norland College graduate Maria Borrallo was hired as a
   live-in member of staff by the Cambridges in 2014 and can often be
   spotted helping out during family events, including this year‚Äôs
   Trooping the Colour on June 8. Meanwhile, Prince Harry remains close to
   favorite childhood nanny Tiggy Pettifer, whom he proudly introduced to
   Meghan on a trip to Cardiff in January 2018.

   ‚ÄúFamily life could not be more perfect for [Harry and Meghan],‚Äù a close
   friend of the couple has told BAZAAR. ‚ÄúEver since Archie arrived they
   haven‚Äôt stopped smiling. The sleepless nights are totally worth it.‚Äù

     * Meghan Markle is launching a capsule collection of work apparel to
       benefit one of her royal patronages, the charity Smart Works, which
       provides support for unemployed women.
     * The collection will launch later this year, and one item will be
       donated for each item bought.
     * The Duchess of Sussex's collaborators on the collection include
       designer Misha Nonoo and U.K. department store Marks & Spencer.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, is on a roll with her fashionable projects
   this week. Days after revealing that she guest edited the September
   issue of British Vogue, Meghan has announced that she's launching a
   capsule collection of workwear to benefit her royal patronage Smart
   Works, a charity that benefits disadvantaged and unemployed women who
   are entering or returning to the workforce.

   Meghan broke the news in her British Vogue issue, according to royal
   reporter Omid Scobie. She recruited an impressive set of collaborators
   for the project: British department stores Marks & Spencer and John
   Lewis, the brand Jigsaw, and her close friend and fashion designer
   Misha Nonoo.

   The collection will launch later this year and will be sold on a
   "one-for-one basis," meaning an item is donated for each item
   purchased. "Not only does this allow us to be part of each other's
   story, it reminds us we are in it together," Meghan explained in the
   magazine.

     The collection, launching later this year, will sell on a
     one-for-one basis. ‚ÄúFor each item purchased by a customer, one is
     donated to charity,‚Äù Meghan writes in @BritishVogue. ‚ÄúNot only does
     this allow us to be part of each other‚Äôs story, it reminds us we are
     in it together.‚Äù
     ‚Äî Omid Scobie (@scobie) July 30, 2019

   The duchess became the royal patron of Smart Works in January and had a
   public engagement at the headquarters that month. During her visit, she
   helped style one woman for a job interview.

   Meghan said during her trip, "It's not just donating your clothes and
   seeing where they land, it's really being part of each other's success
   stories as women."

   Smart Works has grown quickly ever since Duchess Meghan became
   involved. In February, the organization helped 187 women in London,
   which is almost 50 percent more than it assisted in the same month last
   year. Considering the ever-persistent "Meghan effect," the phenomenon
   of an article of clothing selling out after the duchess wears it in
   public, we can only imagine the impact her upcoming collection will
   have on Smart Works.

   We've become so accustomed to filters and false realities on Instagram
   that it can become difficult to tell what's even real anymore. We'd
   like to think we still have a firm grip on reality, but an Instagram
   model named Shudu has just thrown our entire universe for a loop.

   A post shared by Shudu (@shudu.gram) on Nov 20, 2017 at 10:09am PST

   Shudu is an Instagram model with flawless dark skin. Her feed is
   scattered with various editorial images accompanied by #melanin
   hashtags. She even was reposted on Fenty Beauty's Instagram account,
   wearing the lipstick shade Saw-C. Her beauty is so striking and
   unfathomably perfect that you almost don't want to believe it's real.
   The thing is, it's not‚Äîshe's 100 percent CGI.

   "Basically Shudu is my creation, she‚Äôs my art piece that I am working
   on at moment," London-based photographer Cameron-James Wilson told
   BAZAAR.com. "She is not a real model unfortunately, but she represents
   a lot of the real models of today. There‚Äôs a big kind of movement with
   dark skin models, so she represents them and is inspired by them."

   Wilson was hesitant to confirm or deny Shudu's existence when we spoke
   with him on the phone this morning. After all, half the fun of creating
   art this life-like is to make the viewer reconsider their definition of
   reality. Her intent is not to fool or trick anyone, he says, but rather
   to be a beacon of inspiring beauty and creativity.

   "I use a 3D modeling program. It‚Äôs like virtual photography, so once I
   create her, I can kind of pose her in certain ways," Wilson explained.
   "I am a photographer anyway, so it‚Äôs just a way of exploring my
   creativity when I‚Äôm not shooting." A single image, like the one seen on
   Fenty's Instagram, takes several days to create.

   Shudu's striking beauty was actually inspired by a Barbie doll, called
   Princess of South Africa. "Obviously some models like Duckie were
   definitely big inspirations for her as well," revealed the
   photographer, who has also shot models like Gigi Hadid and Devon
   Windsor. It's worth noting that Fenty Beauty, who worked with Duckie on
   the brand's launch, only reposted the image of Shudu. We reached out
   for comment about whether or not they know about the model's
   computer-generated image.

   The technology is undeniably cool, but does Wilson feel any heat for
   creating a black model versus just shooting with a real one? "As a
   photographer, I work with lots of different people all the time, real
   people that have inspired her. At the end of the day, it's a way for me
   to express my creativity‚Äîit‚Äôs not trying to replace anyone. It's only
   trying to add to the kind of movement that's out there," he clarified.
   "It's meant to be beautiful art which empowers people. It‚Äôs not trying
   to take away an opportunity from anyone or replace anyone. She‚Äôs trying
   to complement those people."

   Only a handful of people have turned his work into something negative,
   while most understand his intention, he said. "I am just a creative
   person, and to me she is what the most beautiful woman in the world
   would look like."

   Shudu isn't the only computer-generated model on Instagram. Miquela,
   known as @LilMiquela, has 560,000+ followers who follow along as she
   models new clothes, takes selfies, and sells merch.

   In an era where Facetuning and digitally-altered photos are the norm
   across social platforms, Wilson said he's simply bringing fantasy to
   reality.

   "We live in such a filtered world now, where real is becoming fake. I
   wanted to create something that is fantasy toward becoming more real,
   and bringing it completely the other way."

Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan Officially Choose a Nanny for Baby Archie

   The Duke and Duchess of Sussex take on additional help as they prepare
   for a busy summer and fall tour.

   Frogmore Cottage is welcoming another new arrival. Prince Harry and
   Duchess Meghan have officially hired a nanny for baby Archie.

   Sources confirm to BAZAAR.com that the couple recently took on the
   extra pair of hands ahead of Harry‚Äôs busy summer schedule and Meghan
   planning a return to royal duties this fall.

   While the couple are hoping to keep personal details of the new staff
   member private, BAZAAR understands that the British-born female nanny
   is not permanently based at Frogmore Cottage or working weekends.

   ‚ÄúEver since Archie arrived they haven‚Äôt stopped smiling. The sleepless
   nights are totally worth it.‚Äù

   The additional support will come in particularly handy for the Sussexes
   when they tour Africa this October. Sources say it‚Äôs increasingly
   likely that Archie Mountbatten-Windsor will be joining them for the
   trip.

   Logistics for the overseas visit are still being ironed out, but if
   Archie joins, Prince Harry will take on a number of engagements by
   himself. Stops on the itinerary include Malawi, to focus on the
   expansion of his charity Sentebale, and Angola, where the government is
   about to provide $60 million to clear landmines from two national
   parks.

   Buckingham Palace won't release further details about the two-week trip
   until July, but engagements in Botswana and South Africa are also
   expected to be included on the schedule.

   Harry and Meghan‚Äôs new acquisition joins a long list of much-loved
   royal nannies. Norland College graduate Maria Borrallo was hired as a
   live-in member of staff by the Cambridges in 2014 and can often be
   spotted helping out during family events, including this year‚Äôs
   Trooping the Colour on June 8. Meanwhile, Prince Harry remains close to
   favorite childhood nanny Tiggy Pettifer, whom he proudly introduced to
   Meghan on a trip to Cardiff in January 2018.

   ‚ÄúFamily life could not be more perfect for [Harry and Meghan],‚Äù a close
   friend of the couple has told BAZAAR. ‚ÄúEver since Archie arrived they
   haven‚Äôt stopped smiling. The sleepless nights are totally worth it.‚Äù

     * Meghan Markle is launching a capsule collection of work apparel to
       benefit one of her royal patronages, the charity Smart Works, which
       provides support for unemployed women.
     * The collection will launch later this year, and one item will be
       donated for each item bought.
     * The Duchess of Sussex's collaborators on the collection include
       designer Misha Nonoo and U.K. department store Marks & Spencer.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, is on a roll with her fashionable projects
   this week. Days after revealing that she guest edited the September
   issue of British Vogue, Meghan has announced that she's launching a
   capsule collection of workwear to benefit her royal patronage Smart
   Works, a charity that benefits disadvantaged and unemployed women who
   are entering or returning to the workforce.

   Meghan broke the news in her British Vogue issue, according to royal
   reporter Omid Scobie. She recruited an impressive set of collaborators
   for the project: British department stores Marks & Spencer and John
   Lewis, the brand Jigsaw, and her close friend and fashion designer
   Misha Nonoo.

   The collection will launch later this year and will be sold on a
   "one-for-one basis," meaning an item is donated for each item
   purchased. "Not only does this allow us to be part of each other's
   story, it reminds us we are in it together," Meghan explained in the
   magazine.

     The collection, launching later this year, will sell on a
     one-for-one basis. ‚ÄúFor each item purchased by a customer, one is
     donated to charity,‚Äù Meghan writes in @BritishVogue. ‚ÄúNot only does
     this allow us to be part of each other‚Äôs story, it reminds us we are
     in it together.‚Äù
     ‚Äî Omid Scobie (@scobie) July 30, 2019

   The duchess became the royal patron of Smart Works in January and had a
   public engagement at the headquarters that month. During her visit, she
   helped style one woman for a job interview.

   Meghan said during her trip, "It's not just donating your clothes and
   seeing where they land, it's really being part of each other's success
   stories as women."

   Smart Works has grown quickly ever since Duchess Meghan became
   involved. In February, the organization helped 187 women in London,
   which is almost 50 percent more than it assisted in the same month last
   year. Considering the ever-persistent "Meghan effect," the phenomenon
   of an article of clothing selling out after the duchess wears it in
   public, we can only imagine the impact her upcoming collection will
   have on Smart Works.
