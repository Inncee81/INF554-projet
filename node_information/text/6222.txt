GDPR and Privacy

   In May 2018 the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) replaces
   the existing patchwork of EU National Data Protection legislation and
   brings a level of consistency to data and privacy protection in the EU.
   Even prior to the implementation of GDPR, NETGEAR recognized the
   worldwide importance of privacy, security, and data protection to our
   customers, partners, and employees.

   We have a cross-functional approach to privacy governance, which covers
   all areas of the company and includes customer, partner, and employee
   data. The legal, customer care, IT, HR and Engineering teams meet on a
   regular basis to help guide, design, and develop products and systems
   from the ground up to protect data and privacy. NETGEAR has a Board of
   Directors’ Cybersecurity Committee that is tasked with the oversight
   and monitoring of NETGEAR’s privacy and data security and regularly
   engages with outside experts regarding various privacy issues including
   privacy by design and encryption. NETGEAR has an active cybersecurity
   program and to make sure information is secure, we strictly enforce
   privacy safeguards within the company. This means we use access
   management and access controls commensurate with the risk to data to
   ensure access to data is associated with a business need, such as
   providing customers with support.

   Specifically, as part of our EU General Data Protection Regulation
   (GDPR) work, we have assessed, and continue to assess, our major
   processes, products, and services. In particular, we have:
     * rewritten our privacy policy which is posted on our website;
     * improved processes to help ensure data transparency, accuracy,
       accessibility, completeness, security, and consistency;
     * mapped our data and identified what we have, what we are doing with
       it, where it is, where it flows, and who has access to it;
     * assessed the privacy and data security risks and strengths in our
       enterprise systems and products;
     * implemented data incident response teams and processes;
     * implemented additional third-party controls, vendor oversight,
       monitoring, audit, and remediation requirements; and
     * embedded privacy and security requirements in the product
       development cycle.

   In addition, all NETGEAR employees are required to take training on
   Privacy and Security.

   Finally, NETGEAR complies with all applicable laws that require
   notification about data security incidents. That means we conduct
   prompt investigations and analysis, so that we can provide notification
   in a timely manner if necessary. We are also committed to providing
   customers that have been impacted by an incident with appropriate
   assistance, which may include information about support from NETGEAR or
   advice on steps customers can take to reduce the risk of harm.

GDPR and Privacy

   In May 2018 the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) replaces
   the existing patchwork of EU National Data Protection legislation and
   brings a level of consistency to data and privacy protection in the EU.
   Even prior to the implementation of GDPR, NETGEAR recognized the
   worldwide importance of privacy, security, and data protection to our
   customers, partners, and employees.

   We have a cross-functional approach to privacy governance, which covers
   all areas of the company and includes customer, partner, and employee
   data. The legal, customer care, IT, HR and Engineering teams meet on a
   regular basis to help guide, design, and develop products and systems
   from the ground up to protect data and privacy. NETGEAR has a Board of
   Directors’ Cybersecurity Committee that is tasked with the oversight
   and monitoring of NETGEAR’s privacy and data security and regularly
   engages with outside experts regarding various privacy issues including
   privacy by design and encryption. NETGEAR has an active cybersecurity
   program and to make sure information is secure, we strictly enforce
   privacy safeguards within the company. This means we use access
   management and access controls commensurate with the risk to data to
   ensure access to data is associated with a business need, such as
   providing customers with support.

   Specifically, as part of our EU General Data Protection Regulation
   (GDPR) work, we have assessed, and continue to assess, our major
   processes, products, and services. In particular, we have:
     * rewritten our privacy policy which is posted on our website;
     * improved processes to help ensure data transparency, accuracy,
       accessibility, completeness, security, and consistency;
     * mapped our data and identified what we have, what we are doing with
       it, where it is, where it flows, and who has access to it;
     * assessed the privacy and data security risks and strengths in our
       enterprise systems and products;
     * implemented data incident response teams and processes;
     * implemented additional third-party controls, vendor oversight,
       monitoring, audit, and remediation requirements; and
     * embedded privacy and security requirements in the product
       development cycle.

   In addition, all NETGEAR employees are required to take training on
   Privacy and Security.

   Finally, NETGEAR complies with all applicable laws that require
   notification about data security incidents. That means we conduct
   prompt investigations and analysis, so that we can provide notification
   in a timely manner if necessary. We are also committed to providing
   customers that have been impacted by an incident with appropriate
   assistance, which may include information about support from NETGEAR or
   advice on steps customers can take to reduce the risk of harm.
