   The world is on the cusp of a technology that could revolutionize how
   we use computers, while enabling a host of new products and
   capabilities. Some say it will launch the next industrial supercycle,
   transforming the way we do things across many different sectors.

   Canada is an early mover in the global race to develop and harness the
   power of quantum computers and related technologies. But will years of
   effort and more than a billion dollars invested be enough to keep ahead
   of the competition as the world goes quantum?

What is a quantum computer?

   The Prime Minister apparently knows something about it ...

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/4ZBLSjF56S8

Was Trudeau right?

   Pretty much. It’s true that in quantum physics (unlike classical
   physics) the world gets fuzzy at the atomic scale. Particles can be
   treated as wave-like disturbances that have a certain probability of
   being in one place or another.

   That property can allow an electron to “quantum tunnel” through a
   barrier, because there’s a chance it will spontaneously find itself on
   the other side.

   But there’s more ...

QUBITS

   In quantum physics, a particle can do more than one thing at the same
   time. For example, an electron may have a clockwise spin or a
   counterclockwise spin. But its “quantum state” is a mix of
   probabilities that it is one or the other. In a sense, it is both.
   There is nothing comparable to this in the world of everyday
   experience, and that’s what gives a quantum computer its power.

   A conventional computer uses bits — tiny switches on a computer chip
   that can either be on or off, registering as 1 or 0 for digital
   calculations. A quantum computer uses “qubits,” which blend the
   possibility of being 1 or 0.

Qubits

COMBINING QUBITS

   In a conventional computer, it takes four separate calculations just to
   run through all possible combinations of two bits. The number of
   calculations grows exponentially as more bits are added.

   In a quantum computer, the dual identity of qubits means that all those
   calculations can take place at the same time, providing an answer far
   more quickly.

   This anticipated “quantum speed-up” is the reason there is so much
   excitement about the potential of quantum computers.

WHAT CAN A QUANTUM COMPUTER DO?

   One way to leverage the power of qubits is to use them for searching
   through large stacks of data. For a conventional computer, this amounts
   to doing one calculation after another until the desired item is found.
   A quantum computer could drastically shorten the search time. This
   advantage could be used in all kinds of creative ways, like helping a
   computer vision system correctly identify an object from a vast range
   of possibilities, or enabling real-time language translation, based on
   quickly finding the most likely meaning from a string of spoken words.

QUANTUM-SAFE COMMUNICATIONS

   A quantum computer would have the power to crack much of the world’s
   encrypted communications, including personal, financial and government
   data. These are currently protected by numerical keys that a
   conventional computer cannot decode (because it would take too long to
   try every possible combination). Running on qubits, a quantum computer
   could quickly unlock data that are protected in this way.
   Researchers are now looking for new ways to make communications
   “quantum-safe.” One approach is quantum key distribution, QKD, which
   involves transmitting a key that is encoded by quantum effects so that
   only the intended receiver can use it. Earlier this year China used a
   satellite to demonstrate how such a quantum key might be transmitted
   across long distances.
   Photo: A time-lapse photo taken on Dec. 9, 2016, shows a laser-guided
   satellite-to-earth link between the Chinese quantum satellite ‘Micius’
   and a ground observatory in Ali, in southwest China's Tibet Autonomous
   Region.

Quantum sensors

   The technology required to make a working quantum computer has other
   uses too. Devices that rely on tiny quantum effects can be used as
   exquisitely precise sensors and measuring tools. Such devices could
   revolutionize environmental monitoring, health diagnostics and security
   by making it possible to detect what was once undetectable.

   One example is a portable atomic clock that allows for pinpoint
   accuracy with GPS and is already being used in resource exploration.

   Microsemi.
   Canada is an important player in the quantum tech arena. For example,
   D-Wave Systems, a Burnaby, B.C.,-based company, is selling what it
   calls the world’s first commercial quantum computer. D-Wave is known
   for pioneering an alternative form of quantum computer that could offer
   a shortcut to some of the power that resides in qubits. But the jury is
   still out on whether its system can perform tasks that are commercially
   valuable and that no conventional computer system can do.

   Quantum Valley Investments, launched in 2013 by former Blackberry CEO
   Mike Lazaridis, is a tech investment company that is trying to leverage
   the high concentration of quantum research in and around the University
   of Waterloo to advance companies that make quantum devices and related
   technologies. Mr. Lazaridis says that some of the most promising ideas
   Quantum Valley is exploring are about to jump off the blackboard and
   become working prototypes.

   Computing in Waterloo can be used to produce materials needed for

   Canada ranks fifth in the world for public funding of quantum research.
   But as excitement builds, other players in the United States, China and
   Europe are ramping up their efforts. The next few years will be crucial
   for determining where quantum technology goes from here and who gains
   ultimate quantum supremacy.

Understanding the quantum revolution

   The world is on the cusp of a technology that could revolutionize how
   we use computers, while enabling a host of new products and
   capabilities. Some say it will launch the next industrial supercycle,
   transforming the way we do things across many different sectors.

   Canada is an early mover in the global race to develop and harness the
   power of quantum computers and related technologies. But will years of
   effort and more than a billion dollars invested be enough to keep ahead
   of the competition as the world goes quantum?

What is a quantum computer?

   The Prime Minister apparently knows something about it ...

   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/4ZBLSjF56S8

Was Trudeau right?

   Pretty much. It’s true that in quantum physics (unlike classical
   physics) the world gets fuzzy at the atomic scale. Particles can be
   treated as wave-like disturbances that have a certain probability of
   being in one place or another.

   That property can allow an electron to “quantum tunnel” through a
   barrier, because there’s a chance it will spontaneously find itself on
   the other side.

Classical Particle

   But there’s more ...

QUBITS

   In quantum physics, a particle can do more than one thing at the same
   time. For example, an electron may have a clockwise spin or a
   counterclockwise spin. But its “quantum state” is a mix of
   probabilities that it is one or the other. In a sense, it is both.
   There is nothing comparable to this in the world of everyday
   experience, and that’s what gives a quantum computer its power.

   A conventional computer uses bits — tiny switches on a computer chip
   that can either be on or off, registering as 1 or 0 for digital
   calculations. A quantum computer uses “qubits,” which blend the
   possibility of being 1 or 0.

Bits

Qubits

   [image-ph-light.png]

COMBINING QUBITS

   In a conventional computer, it takes four separate calculations just to
   run through all possible combinations of two bits. The number of
   calculations grows exponentially as more bits are added.

   In a quantum computer, the dual identity of qubits means that all those
   calculations can take place at the same time, providing an answer far
   more quickly.

Binary Calculation

Qubit Calculation

   [image-ph-light.png]

   This anticipated “quantum speed-up” is the reason there is so much
   excitement about the potential of quantum computers.

WHAT CAN A QUANTUM COMPUTER DO?

   One way to leverage the power of qubits is to use them for searching
   through large stacks of data. For a conventional computer, this amounts
   to doing one calculation after another until the desired item is found.
   A quantum computer could drastically shorten the search time. This
   advantage could be used in all kinds of creative ways, like helping a
   computer vision system correctly identify an object from a vast range
   of possibilities, or enabling real-time language translation, based on
   quickly finding the most likely meaning from a string of spoken words.

   Mark Sommerfeld for The Globe and Mail

QUANTUM-SAFE COMMUNICATIONS

   A quantum computer would have the power to crack much of the world’s
   encrypted communications, including personal, financial and government
   data. These are currently protected by numerical keys that a
   conventional computer cannot decode (because it would take too long to
   try every possible combination). Running on qubits, a quantum computer
   could quickly unlock data that are protected in this way.
   Researchers are now looking for new ways to make communications
   “quantum-safe.” One approach is quantum key distribution, QKD, which
   involves transmitting a key that is encoded by quantum effects so that
   only the intended receiver can use it. Earlier this year China used a
   satellite to demonstrate how such a quantum key might be transmitted
   across long distances.
   Photo: A time-lapse photo taken on Dec. 9, 2016, shows a laser-guided
   satellite-to-earth link between the Chinese quantum satellite ‘Micius’
   and a ground observatory in Ali, in southwest China's Tibet Autonomous
   Region.

Quantum sensors

   The technology required to make a working quantum computer has other
   uses too. Devices that rely on tiny quantum effects can be used as
   exquisitely precise sensors and measuring tools. Such devices could
   revolutionize environmental monitoring, health diagnostics and security
   by making it possible to detect what was once undetectable.

   One example is a portable atomic clock that allows for pinpoint
   accuracy with GPS and is already being used in resource exploration.

   Microsemi.
   Canada is an important player in the quantum tech arena. For example,
   D-Wave Systems, a Burnaby, B.C.,-based company, is selling what it
   calls the world’s first commercial quantum computer. D-Wave is known
   for pioneering an alternative form of quantum computer that could offer
   a shortcut to some of the power that resides in qubits. But the jury is
   still out on whether its system can perform tasks that are commercially
   valuable and that no conventional computer system can do.

   Mark Sommerfeld for The Globe and Mail
   Quantum Valley Investments, launched in 2013 by former Blackberry CEO
   Mike Lazaridis, is a tech investment company that is trying to leverage
   the high concentration of quantum research in and around the University
   of Waterloo to advance companies that make quantum devices and related
   technologies. Mr. Lazaridis says that some of the most promising ideas
   Quantum Valley is exploring are about to jump off the blackboard and
   become working prototypes.

   Computing in Waterloo can be used to produce materials needed for
   quantum devices.

   Canada ranks fifth in the world for public funding of quantum research.
   But as excitement builds, other players in the United States, China and
   Europe are ramping up their efforts. The next few years will be crucial
   for determining where quantum technology goes from here and who gains
   ultimate quantum supremacy.
