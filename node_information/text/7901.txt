India: 'World’s wettest place' suffers water shortage

   Climate change, population increase set off water shortages in what was
   once the wettest place on earth.

   India: 'World’s wettest place' suffers water shortage
   Despite a relatively wet environment, Cherrapunji is suffering from
   water shortage for human use [Subhamoy Bhattacharjee/Al Jazeera]

   Meghalaya state, India  -  For those recently debating climate change
   at the global summit in Paris, the coinciding deluge in India's
   southern city of Chennai seemed a powerful illustration that the
   gathering urgently needed to succeed in its aims.
   WATCH: Will the climate deal be enough to save the planet?

   While flooding hit the south, an increasing lack of water in
   Cherrapunji, a northeastern town which was once the world’s wettest
   place, is causing growing concern among residents.

   Both Indian examples point to the vicissitudes of climate change on our
   planet in a country where a rising population always creates huge
   pressures on the environment.

   In 1861, Cherrapunji, known to locals as Sohra, created a world record
   with 22,987mm of rainfall in a year.

   More than 150 years later, and experiencing an average annual rainfall
   of 11,430mm, it is still the second wettest place in the world.

   Mawsynram, a village just six kilometres away and boasting an average
   annual rainfall of 11,887km, is now considered the dampest place on the
   globe.

   However, the current rainfall in Cherrapunji, located in Meghalaya
   state, is just one third of what it was in the 1970s.

   Cherrapunji usually receives heavy rains, although the amount has
   declined over the past decades [Subhamoy Bhattacharjee / Al Jazeera ]

Deforestation

   The reasons for the dramatic decline in rainfall are disputed.

   Residents blame events beyond their control for the problems they face
   - the place is hotter, drier and shorter of water than even before.

   "We never had very large forests around Cherrapunji. Those that were
   there were sacred to us and we did not cut a branch," says Millergrace
   Symlieh, a senior member of the Sohra Science Society.

   "We are affected by what's happening all over the world," he told Al
   Jazeera.

   "This hot weather and less rain here is not due to huge deforestation
   or massive industrialisation. We only have a cement plant near here."

   However, Amarjyoti Borah of the Centre of Environment and Social Policy
   Research, based in India's northeastern city of Guwahati, says
   deforestation by illegal logging groups enjoying political patronage
   has badly damaged the forests around Cherrapunji, and that has
   adversely affected the local ecology.

   "The place still gets much rain, but with very few trees still
   standing, all the water just washes away downhill," says Borah.

   "There is no culture of rain harvesting here, as residents never felt
   it was necessary.

   "So Cherrapunji suffers acute water scarcity when the rainfall starts
   to drop sharply from November until March."

Population growth

   The past 10 years have seen a major drop in the average annual rainfall
   in Cherrapunji.

   "It is basically since 2005 that we are often getting 8,000mm to
   9,000mm of rain in Cherrapunji annually - against the normal average of
   11,000mm," says Amit Chaudhuri in the Cherrapunji weather office.

   Even Chadhuri’s "normal average" of 11,000mm of annual rain is a far
   cry from the 1970s, when Cherrapunji got almost double that amount of
   annual rainfall.

   In 1974, Cherrapunji experienced 24,555mm of annual rain, a world
   record.

   So at about 8,000mm to 9,000mm, the present average is only about a
   third of the town's annual rainfall compared with only 40 years ago.

   That was when Cherrapunji had far fewer people living in the town.

   In 1961, it had 7,000 residents – now it has 10 times more.

   "Our water supply was meant to cater to a small population, but now it
   cannot cater to a much bigger population," says Symlieh.

Water supply system

   Such is the shortage of water in the months between November and March
   that Cherrapunji's residents have to walk down the hill for several
   hours to fetch water from the springs.

   It is hard work, with buckets placed in wooden carts which are dragged
   uphill with some effort.

   "The other option is to buy water," says Mary Pariat, a housewife in
   Cherrapunji.

   Tankers loaded with water go up the hill to Cherrapunji every day in
   the lean months -   from November to March - and sell water for
   anything between 10 to 15 Indian rupees (about 20 cents) for a big
   bucket.

   "That is our last option," says Pariat, as she gestures towards a
   unique water point near her home - a leak in the town's water
   pipeline.

   "We put our buckets under the leak and collect the water," she says.
   "But often that is not enough."

   The water supply in the town provided by the state’s public health
   engineering department is active only for a few hours.

   "People rush to the taps in the localities and fill up as many buckets
   as possible," says community elder William Shalong. "For washing and
   bathing, we go down to the springs."

   But even the discharge in the springs drops sharply in the lean months
   - so the Public Health Engineering (PHE) would not be able to improve
   water supply in the town even if they wanted to.

   Officials of the department, unwilling to be quoted because they are
   not authorised to speak to the media, say the water supply system was
   built for 15,000 to 20,000 people.

   "How can that hold for 70,000 people," says a PHE official, pointing to
   the rising population's pressure on resources, a familiar story all
   over heavily populated India.

    'Earlier we got rains here even during the winters and that is not
   happening now,' says teacher Manora Nongbri. 'Now we have to purchase
   water in winter'   [Subhamoy Bhattacharjee/Al Jazeera]

Rainfall

   Reminiscing about Cherrapunji' s decades-old claim to fame, local
   teacher Ila Manora Nongbri said: "That seems like history. We can't
   expect that anymore.

   "Earlier, we got rains here even during the winters and that is not
   happening now. We have to purchase water here in the winter where
   before there was so much rain. We never learnt water harvesting, but we
   don't have a choice now."

   Meanwhile, her sister Mimi complains that rainfall is now very erratic.

   "We suddenly get rains when they are not expected and we don't get them
   when we expect them," she tells Al Jazeera.

   "Also rains have got very localised here and it does not rain all over
   the place anymore. Often one locality gets rain, while the other
   doesn't."

   Meghalaya is not alone in experiencing major changes in its climate.

   The neighbouring state of Assam was once, and perhaps still is ,famous
   for its destructive floods caused by rivers like the Brahmaputra.

   But for the past two years, during the late winter and summer months,
   half of its 28 districts have suffered drought.

Drought

   India named Meghalaya - "home of the clouds" in Hindi - when a new
   separate hill state was created from the Khasi, Garo and Jaintia Hills
   of the large imperial province of Assam in 1972.

   But the kind of relentless downpour for 14 days that the Khasi
   tribespeople here called "khadsaw-miat" is clearly a thing of the past.

   Now the Khasi say "slaup" for rain, but they also have a new word in
   their vocabulary, picked up from English - "drought". And when they
   talk of drought in Meghalaya, there is little doubt the world is
   changing - as is its climate.

   India has said it will launch its second lunar mission in mid-July, as
   it moves to consolidate its status as a leader in space technology by
   achieving a controlled landing on the moon.

   The mission, if successful, would make India only the fourth country
   behind the United States, Russia and China to perform a "soft" landing
   on the moon and put a rover on it. China successfully landed a lunar
   rover in January.

   The unmanned mission, called Chandrayaan-2, which means "moon vehicle"
   in Sanskrit, will involve an orbiter, a lander and a rover, which have
   been built by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO).

   The mission is scheduled to launch on July 15 on board ISRO's
   Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark III. It will cost about 10
   billion rupees ($144m), ISRO said on Wednesday.

   After a journey of more than 50 days, ISRO's lander will attempt a
   "soft", controlled landing near the lunar South Pole around September
   6.

   Once it touches down, the rover will carry out experiments while being
   controlled remotely by ISRO scientists.

   "The last 15 minutes to the landing are going to be the most terrifying
   moments for us," ISRO Chairman K. Sivan told media. The agency said
   variations in lunar gravity, terrain and dust could all cause problems.

'Most complex mission'

   The Indian mission would be the third attempted lunar landing this year
   after China's successful Chang'e-4 lunar probe and the Israeli
   spacecraft Beresheet, which failed and crashed onto the moon in April.

   "It is the most complex mission ISRO has ever undertaken," Sivan said.

   Chandrayaan-1, India's first lunar mission in 2008, cost $79m and
   helped confirm the presence of water on the moon.

   The Chandrayaan-2 was originally planned as a collaboration with
   Russia's Roscosmos space agency, but in 2013 India scrapped the tie-up
   due to technical differences with the Russian programme.

   In 2014, India launched an unmanned Mars mission at a cost of $74m, or
   less than the budget of the Hollywood space blockbuster, Gravity, and a
   fraction of the $671m the US space agency NASA spent on its MAVEN Mars
   mission.

   In 2017, India launched a record 104 satellites in a single mission and
   has also built a reputation for low-cost space exploration and science
   missions.

   In March, India said it shot down one of its own satellites, making it
   one of only four countries in the world to possess this technology.

Democrats call contents of whistle-blower complaint 'disturbing'

   House votes 421-0 on resolution condemning White House for previously
   withholding complaint and demanding its release.

   Washington, DC - US House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff
   told reporters on Wednesday that allegations laid out in
   the whistle-blower complaint concerning President Donald Trump were
   "very credible" and "deeply disturbing".

   After previously resisting calls from members of Congress to release
   the complaint, the White House sent its contents to the House and
   Senate Intelligence Committees on Wednesday.

   "The report reinforces our concerns," said House Democrat Mike Quigley.

   "It's serious. It's troubling. It's detailed. It's thorough. It
   deserves consideration by the American people," said Representative
   Raja Krishnamoorthi, a Democrat member of the Intelligence Committee.

   Republican Senator Ben Sasse told reporters that there are "real
   troubling" things in the report, adding that "Republicans ought not
   just circle the wagons".

   But other Republicans said they did not see anything that was
   concerning to them.

   "I haven't seen anything that bothers me," said Mike Conaway, a
   Republican member of the House Intelligence Committee.

   The Trump administration's decision to release the complaint's contents
   to the committees came just hours before the House voted 421-0 on a
   non-binding resolution condemning the Trump administration for
   withholding its contents and demanding its release. Two representatives
   voted present.

   Reports of the complaint, as well as Trump comments surrounding it,
   were the basis of Speaker Nancy Pelosi's decision to announce the House
   was moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry of Trump.

   The complaint was reportedly centred on a June phone call between Trump
   and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which the US president
   prodded his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate political rival Joe
   Biden, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination. A
   memo of the phone call was released earlier on Wednesday.

   Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire had been
   prevented from giving Congress the whistle-blower complaint by White
   House and Justice Department lawyers who argued it did not rise to a
   sufficient level of concern. Maguire is scheduled to testify publicly
   before Schiff's committee on Thursday.

   Wednesday's House vote came after the US Senate unanimously approved a
   similar non-binding resolution with Republicans joining Democrats in
   support of the measure and putting pressure on the White House to be
   more forthcoming.

'I didn't do it'

   Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. At a news conference before
   Wednesday's vote, Trump denied he had linked delivery of US military
   aid to Zelensky's help in investigating Biden.

   "I didn't do it," Trump said. "You take a look at that call. It was
   perfect. There was no quid pro quo."
   At the time of the call, Trump was withholding nearly $400m in military
   aid to Ukraine.

   He has called the Democrats' impeachment inquiry "witch-hunt garbage"
   and a "hoax".

   "I respect the responsibility of the president to engage with foreign
   leaders as part of his job. It is not part of his job to use taxpayer
   money to shake down other countries for the benefit of his campaign,"
   Pelosi said in a statement released by her office earlier today.
   Schiff told reporters at a news conference the president's phone call
   "was a classic Mafia-like shakedown".
   Many House Democrats called the information in the Trump-Zelensky call
   evidence of impeachable conduct by the president. Others withheld
   judgment saying the goal of the impeachment inquiry should be to
   methodically assemble the facts.

   "It's treason. It's treason. And treason, last time I checked, is an
   impeachable offence," Representative Peter DeFazio, a 17-term senior
   Democrat, told reporters in the Capitol.
   "You have to lay out the facts very carefully. We don't have all the
   facts yet. That's why we are going to have hearings because you have to
   gather the facts, particularly on this Ukrainian situation," said
   Representative Donna Shalala, who served in the administration of
   former President Bill Clinton during his impeachment in 1998.
   Republicans sought to discount the implications of what Trump said in
   the phone call, saying there is no evidence the president was linking
   the future delivery of US military aid to Zelensky opening an
   investigation of Biden's family.

   Americans are tired of what they see as political games in Washington,
   said Representative Dan Crenshaw, a Republican and former US Navy SEAL.
   "The Russian collusion thing, all of this stuff, this is so far down
   the list when it comes to regular voters," Crenshaw told Al Jazeera.

   "They see this as noise in the media. They are exhausted by what they
   perceive to be political games. And in this case, boy, are they right,"
   he added. "This is the height of political gamesmanship. This attempt
   to read-in to some kind of ill intent behind the president's
   conversation is beyond the pale. You have really got to squint. You
   have got to do mental gymnastics."

   Representative Al Green, the first Democrat to push for impeachment
   earlier this year, said he expects the political dialogue going forward
   in the US to be divisive as Democrats move forward on impeachment.
   "I don't think this is going to be easy for us because it hasn't been
   easy for me. I am the guy who has received death threats. I'm the guy
   that they said they want to lynch," Green told Al Jazeera. "It hasn't
   been easy for me. It is not going to be easy for any of us. But we have
   got to put principle above politics."

   The House is preparing to take a two-week break from Washington and
   members will be going home to their districts where they inevitably
   will have to face voter's questions.
   "It is very important that members go home and explain to their
   constituents their thinking," Representative Steny Hoyer, the
   number-two Democrat leader, told reporters. "This is a matter of grave
   importance and the American people need to understand what is
   occurring."
