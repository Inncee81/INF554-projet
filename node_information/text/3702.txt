The Sisters Who First Tried to Take Down Jeffrey Epstein

   Nine years before any police investigation, Maria and Annie Farmer
   reported the troubling behavior of Jeffrey Epstein and his companion,
   Ghislaine Maxwell. No one would act.

   As more women have come forward in recent days to describe assaults at
   the hands of Jeffrey Epstein, Maria Farmer finds herself distraught,
   wondering what might have happened if someone had taken her seriously.

   Twenty-four years ago, Ms. Farmer was an artist who had entered the
   unorthodox life Mr. Epstein lived behind the doors of his luxury
   estates. Mr. Epstein had offered to help her painting career, but it
   all came to an abrupt end one night in the summer of 1996, when she
   says Mr. Epstein and his companion, Ghislaine Maxwell, began violently
   groping her.

   She learned later that her 16-year-old sister, Annie Farmer, had been
   subjected to a troubling topless massage at Mr. Epstein’s ranch in New
   Mexico.

   [Several of Mr. Epstein’s accusers spoke at a hearing. “Justice has
   never been served in this case,” one said.]

   Ms. Farmer contacted the New York Police Department, and said she then
   went to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, offering to share what she
   knew about Mr. Epstein and the parade of young women being brought to
   Mr. Epstein’s houses. Though the bureau has never acknowledged such a
   contact, Ms. Farmer said the F.B.I. must have had a record of it,
   because agents came back to her — years later — with questions. She
   also went to leaders in the New York art world that Mr. Epstein and Ms.
   Maxwell frequented, and the sisters tried to tell their story to a
   national magazine.

   In each case, their reports went nowhere.

   Finally, facing what she said were threats as a result of the sisters’
   claims, Ms. Farmer abandoned her New York art career and stopped
   painting altogether.

   “I did not want another young lady to go through what Annie went
   through,” Maria Farmer said in a recent interview. “I could handle what
   happened to me. I could not handle what happened to her.”

   Mr. Epstein would continue to lure vulnerable girls into his predatory
   circle for another nine years before investigators began diving deep
   into his world. After being arrested on federal charges of sex
   trafficking of minors in New York and Florida, Mr. Epstein died earlier
   this month in what the authorities said was an apparent suicide.

   [Listen to “The Daily” episode on the Farmer sisters and Jeffrey
   Epstein.]

   Other women have come forward in recent years with even more serious
   claims of rape and child abuse against Mr. Epstein, but the Farmer
   sisters’ reports — made 23 years ago — are the earliest known
   allegations about Mr. Epstein’s troubling physical contact with girls
   and young women. In their detailed accounts, told here for the first
   time, they offer a glimpse of how Mr. Epstein managed to avoid
   significant scrutiny for years, even as concerns about his conduct
   began to pile up.

   Ms. Farmer said that she feels guilty about having brought her sister
   into Mr. Epstein’s orbit. She mourns the victims who came after her,
   she said, her voice cracking each time she mentioned the name of one of
   them. She has spent years trying to live in seclusion.

The First Meeting

   Ms. Farmer moved to New York in 1993, eager to pursue her passion for
   art, and enrolled at the New York Academy of Art.

   She already had a specialty, exploring figures of nudes and
   adolescents, and had a chance to train under one of her idols, the
   painter and sculptor Eric Fischl. One of her paintings was done in a
   voyeuristic style, showing a man in the frame of a doorway looking at a
   woman on a sofa — a painting she said was inspired by Edgar Degas’s
   famous piece “Interior,” which is sometimes known as “The Rape.”

   At a gallery show for her graduation, Ms. Farmer said, the dean of the
   academy, Eileen Guggenheim, introduced her to Mr. Epstein and Ms.
   Maxwell, and told her to sell them the painting with the man in the
   doorway at a discount. (Ms. Guggenheim said she did not recall such an
   interaction.)

   Afterward, Ms. Farmer said, Mr. Epstein called her to offer her a job
   acquiring art on his behalf, and later managing the entrance to a
   townhouse he was renovating.

   There, at the age of 25, she was introduced to Mr. Epstein’s odd life,
   with girls and young women coming through for what she recalled Ms.
   Maxwell describing as modeling auditions for the lingerie retailer
   Victoria’s Secret. The house at times bustled in anticipation of
   potential visits from Bill Clinton, although she never actually saw him
   there.

   She said she met Donald J. Trump one day in Mr. Epstein’s office,
   recalling Mr. Trump eyeing her before Mr. Epstein informed him that
   “she’s not for you.” Ms. Farmer’s mother, Janice Swain, recalled her
   daughter detailing the interaction with Mr. Trump around the time it
   occurred.

   Both Mr. Clinton and Mr. Trump have acknowledged knowing Mr. Epstein,
   with Mr. Clinton denying knowledge of anything improper and Mr. Trump
   saying he was “not a fan” of Mr. Epstein.

   Ms. Maxwell was charming and friendly, Ms. Farmer said, and as Mr.
   Epstein’s companion, she offered young women a level of assurance that
   they were safe in his presence. But she also seemed to play an
   important role in bringing young women in, Ms. Farmer said, recalling
   that Ms. Maxwell would leave the house saying, “I’ve got to go get
   girls for Jeffrey.”

   Ms. Maxwell would refer to the girls she was looking for as “nubiles,”
   Ms. Farmer said. “They had a driver, and he would be driving along, and
   Ghislaine would say, ‘Get that girl,’” she said. “And they’d stop, and
   she’d run out and get the girl and talk to her.”

   Lawyers for Ms. Maxwell and Mr. Epstein did not respond to requests for
   comment for this article.

The Younger Sister

   when she was 16.CreditTamir Kalifa for The New York Times

   One of the girls in whom the couple took an interest was Ms. Farmer’s
   younger sister Annie.

   Ms. Farmer had mentioned to them that her sister was looking to go to
   college. Mr. Epstein offered to help, and brought Annie, then 16 years
   old and living in Arizona, to visit New York.

   Annie Farmer said she recalled Mr. Epstein as kind and casual, wearing
   sweatpants, pouring champagne and talking about her college plans.
   During the trip, they all went to see a movie. As the film progressed,
   Mr. Epstein began rubbing Annie’s hand, and then her lower leg, she
   said.

   “It was one of those things that just gave me a weird feeling but
   wasn’t that weird + probably normal,” Ms. Farmer wrote in a diary entry
   dated Jan. 25, 1996. “The one thing that kind of weirded me out about
   it was he let go of my hand when he was talking to Maria.”

   Mr. Epstein offered to send Annie Farmer on a trip to Thailand, and
   invited her to his New Mexico ranch for a weekend. Under the impression
   that the gathering would include a number of students chaperoned by Ms.
   Maxwell, Annie’s mother, Ms. Swain, said she allowed Annie to go. But
   when she arrived in New Mexico, Annie said, it was just her and Mr.
   Epstein and Ms. Maxwell.

   There were more uncomfortable interactions that weekend, she said. She
   recalled Ms. Maxwell persuading her to give Mr. Epstein a foot massage
   and then giving pointers as she performed it. They went to another
   movie, where Mr. Epstein continued another round of his petting
   touches, she said.

   Then, when she woke up in the house one morning, she recalled him
   coming into the room, saying he wanted to cuddle, and getting into bed
   next to her.

   Ms. Farmer also recalled Ms. Maxwell repeatedly asking whether she
   wanted a massage. Eventually relenting, Ms. Farmer followed directions
   by taking off her clothes and bra and getting under a sheet on a
   massage table. Ms. Maxwell performed the massage, at one point having
   Ms. Farmer lie on her back as Ms. Maxwell pulled down the sheet to
   massage her chest.

   “I don’t think there was any reason for her to be touching me that
   way,” Ms. Farmer said.

   Mr. Epstein did not participate, but Ms. Farmer said she could sense
   that he was in the area and possibly watching.

The First Reports

   Epstein.

   At the time, Maria Farmer was unaware of the interactions her younger
   sister had in New Mexico. She went to Ohio around that time to focus on
   her paintings, utilizing Mr. Epstein’s large estate there. The
   residence was inside a complex developed by Les Wexner, the chief
   executive of L Brands, the parent company of Victoria’s Secret.

   Later in the summer, Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell paid a visit. One
   night, she recalled getting an unusual request: Mr. Epstein needed his
   feet massaged.

   The foot massage was brief and awkward, Ms. Farmer recalled, as Mr.
   Epstein groaned with what seemed like exaggerated pleasure, followed by
   a yelp of pain. Then he invited her to sit on the bed, where he was
   watching a PBS program about math.

   Ms. Maxwell joined them on the bed, Ms. Farmer said, and the night took
   a sudden turn: Both Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell began groping Ms.
   Farmer over her clothes, rubbing her body, commenting on her features,
   and twisting her nipples to the point of bruising. She said they did so
   in unison, mirroring each other’s movements. Fearing that she was about
   to be raped, Ms. Farmer eventually fled the room and barricaded herself
   in another part of the house.

   She soon discovered that three nude photographs she had kept in a
   storage box were missing. The photos were of Annie and a third Farmer
   sister, who was 12, modeling for Maria’s figurative paintings.

   Ms. Farmer said she began phoning people in a panic, looking for help.
   One of the people she reached was her art mentor, Mr. Fischl. In an
   interview, he recalled Ms. Farmer describing a physical encounter in
   the bedroom, fear for her sister and outrage about the missing
   photographs.

   “I just kept telling Maria, ‘You’ve got to get out of there. You’ve got
   to get out of there,’” Mr. Fischl said.

   Maria’s father, Frank Farmer, also recalled getting a call. He did not
   know the specifics of what transpired, but said his daughter was upset
   enough that he drove to the estate in Ohio from Kentucky to get her.

   After speaking with Annie and learning that Annie had had her own
   troubles with Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell, Maria Farmer said, she
   returned to New York. She recalled getting a phone call from Ms.
   Maxwell, saying she planned to burn all of Ms. Farmer’s art and that
   her career was over. Frightened, Ms. Farmer said she went to a local
   police precinct to report what had happened to her in Ohio, and about
   the art.

   Officers at the New York Police Department precinct took a report on
   the purported threat and on the art theft allegation, a copy of which
   was obtained by The New York Times. But they referred her to other
   agencies, including the F.B.I., concerning the assault allegation
   because Ohio was outside their jurisdiction, Ms. Farmer said.

   Ms. Farmer said she called the F.B.I. and spoke for about half an hour
   with the agent who answered the phone. The agent did not say what would
   happen with her report, she said. She asked if she should phone other
   law enforcement officials in individual states, like Ohio and New
   Mexico, and was told that was “up to you,” she said. She recalled
   contacting at least one other jurisdiction — she did not remember which
   — and making no progress.

   An F.B.I. spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the agency had a
   report of such a call from Ms. Farmer in its files.

   In recent days, the art collector Stuart Pivar said he recalled running
   into Ms. Farmer at a flea market around that time, and hearing her
   discuss serious concerns about Mr. Epstein that she said she had
   reported to law enforcement.

   Ms. Farmer said she also raised her concerns about Mr. Epstein with
   leaders in the art community, including Ms. Guggenheim, the dean at the
   art school who had first put her in touch with Mr. Epstein. But she
   said Ms. Guggenheim did not seem to take the issue seriously. Ms.
   Guggenheim said in an interview that the details she was aware of at
   the time did not rise to a level that would require intervention.

   The two Farmer sisters made another run at telling their story in 2003
   to Vicky Ward, a reporter for Vanity Fair, which had commissioned an
   article about Mr. Epstein’s complicated finances that would also
   mention his proclivity for young girls. The article was published with
   no mention of the Farmers, and they felt they were left badly exposed.

   Ms. Ward wrote on her personal blog in 2011 that the article went in a
   different direction because of “not knowing quite whom to believe.” The
   editor, Graydon Carter, said in an email that Ms. Ward’s sourcing on
   the Farmers’ account did not meet the magazine’s legal standards. But
   Ms. Ward indicated on Twitter recently that she believed that Mr.
   Carter had succumbed to pressure from Mr. Epstein. John Connolly, a
   former contributing editor at Vanity Fair, said he recalled Mr. Carter
   talking about the efforts Mr. Epstein had made to influence the
   article.

   When word got out that the sisters had given a detailed interview to
   the magazine, the angry phone calls to her resumed, Ms. Farmer said.

   “Better be careful and watch your back,” she said Ms. Maxwell told her.
   “She said, ‘I know you go to the West Side Highway all the time. While
   you’re out there, just be really careful because there are a lot of
   ways to die there.’”

The Aftermath

   begun painting again.CreditAndrea Morales for The New York Times

   Ms. Farmer said the threats led her to abandon her life in the New York
   art scene, where Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell still held considerable
   sway. While Annie has moved forward with life, obtaining a Ph.D. and
   working as a psychotherapist, Ms. Farmer struggled to move past the
   year she spent with Mr. Epstein. She felt sickened by her own
   paintings, which she realized Mr. Epstein had apparently appreciated
   not for their artistic value, but for their depiction of nude forms of
   girls.

   Unable to forget the comments Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell had made
   about her breasts, Ms. Farmer said she underwent breast reduction
   surgery.

   It was not until 2006, when F.B.I. agents knocked on her door in North
   Carolina, that Ms. Farmer found renewed hope that Mr. Epstein would be
   held accountable. New allegations about Mr. Epstein had surfaced the
   previous year, when a report by a teenager in Florida spurred an
   extensive investigation that uncovered a wide range of young girls who
   had been recruited to visit Mr. Epstein’s lavish home in Palm Beach.

   Heavily redacted records released by the F.B.I. appear to show
   handwritten notes from November 2006 interviews with Maria Farmer and
   Annie Farmer, outlining key details of their stories, including Maria’s
   visit to the New York police and her referral to the F.B.I.

   But though the investigation progressed, a widely criticized plea deal
   eventually quashed any federal prosecution. To the sisters, the 2008
   plea agreement, which allowed Mr. Epstein to plead guilty merely to
   much less serious state charges, was deeply demoralizing.

   Ms. Farmer was starting to put some of it behind her when the latest
   news about Mr. Epstein began to emerge, and more victims began coming
   forward. She found herself crying when she saw those accounts,
   wondering what it would have taken to stop him when she first tried.
   Though the time for a lawsuit has long passed, she has been working
   with a lawyer, David Boies, to support other victims of Mr. Epstein.

   “Every time I hear one of the girls tell their story, it devastates
   me,” Ms. Farmer said.

   Ms. Farmer, who recently received a diagnosis of a brain tumor, said
   she still had some fear about coming forward to tell her own story,
   even after Mr. Epstein’s death. She recently moved to a new home in the
   South to improve her privacy.

   In her new residence, she has laid out an art studio in front of
   windows that offer a peek-a-boo view of a nearby lake. She has started
   painting again, for the first time in years, and new pieces are stacked
   up against the walls.

   One day, she said, she will try to bring artistic shape to her
   experience with Mr. Epstein. But for now, she has been focused on a
   series of paintings of families and children.

   They are not like her earlier paintings, the ones Mr. Epstein liked.
   All the girls are clothed.

Hiring Is Very Hard for Restaurants These Days. Now They May Have to Fire.

   Amid a severe labor shortage and a renewed U.S. crackdown on
   undocumented immigrants, owners are facing a choice: fire workers or
   risk prosecution.

   Facing one of the most severe labor shortages in decades, restaurants
   across the country are trying virtually everything to recruit cooks and
   dishwashers, from offering quarterly bonuses to providing training
   programs for ex-convicts.

   Now, the specter of increased immigration enforcement is putting many
   of those restaurants in a more fraught situation: let go of trusted
   employees or risk criminal prosecution.

   The problems began in March and April, when the Social Security
   Administration sent letters to hundreds of thousands of business
   owners, notifying them that the names of some employees did not match
   the Social Security numbers on their tax forms.

   These “no-match letters” sowed fear and confusion in workplaces that
   depend on immigrant employees, like farms, factories and construction
   sites. But few businesses have felt the impact of the government
   notices more than restaurants, which have long relied on undocumented
   labor and struggled with high turnover.

   “If you ask any restaurant now what’s keeping them up at night, it’s
   this,” said Carolyn Richmond, an employment lawyer in New York. “We do
   have a lot more diverse work force than most industries, and
   unfortunately many of them may be undocumented.”

   Over the last few months, the restaurant owners who received no-match
   letters have divided into two general camps. Some risk-averse employers
   are planning to fire their undocumented workers or adopt more stringent
   hiring protocols, like using the federal E-Verify program to check new
   hires’ documents. Others have done practically nothing, convinced that
   they have no choice but to ignore the notices because they can ill
   afford to lose employees in a tight labor market.

   After the no-match letters arrived, many restaurant owners were advised
   by their lawyers to give affected employees a few months to correct the
   problems in the government’s records.

   For some restaurants, the end of that window has already arrived or is
   fast approaching. That could mean a wave of firings is in store, once
   it becomes clear that certain employees lack legal status. But with
   restaurants already struggling to hire enough workers, some owners are
   likely to ignore the letters, putting themselves at risk of legal
   penalties.

   “We’ve definitely seen every part of the spectrum, from wanting to be
   compliant to ‘we’re just going to stick our heads in the sand,’” said
   Becki Young, a lawyer in Maryland who has advised restaurants across
   the country on how to respond to the no-match letters. “Some of our
   clients will have some really hard decisions to make.”

   A no-match letter from the Social Security Administration is not the
   same as an immigration audit, which would be conducted by Immigration
   and Customs Enforcement. And some of the Social Security discrepancies
   involve minor clerical issues, like a missing digit or a spelling
   mistake in an employee’s name.

   “Social Security is not a law enforcement agency,” said Mark Hinkle,
   the agency’s acting press secretary. “Our role is limited in scope to
   trying to ensure we credit each employee with his or her earnings.”

   But the letters effectively require business owners to check whether
   the employees identified are properly documented. And in a potential
   ICE audit, employers who fail to investigate a no-match letter — or to
   act on what they find — could be deemed to have “constructive
   knowledge” of an employee’s immigration status, exposing them to hefty
   fines and possible criminal charges.

   The last time the federal government sent a large number of no-match
   letters was more than a decade ago, when President George W. Bush was
   in office. Amid a broader crackdown on illegal immigration, the Trump
   administration has revived the process, at the same time that ICE has
   upped the frequency of its audits. In fiscal 2018, the agency initiated
   nearly 6,000 I-9 audits, a more than 400 percent increase from the
   previous year. And the ICE raids in Mississippi this month, which swept
   up hundreds of undocumented employees at agricultural plants,
   underscored the specter of increased enforcement across the food
   industry.

   The experiences of two restaurant owners in New York City show how the
   pressures that face the industry have elicited strikingly divergent
   responses. The owners spoke on condition of anonymity because they did
   not want to attract attention from ICE.

   One of them, who owns a restaurant group with locations in New York and
   Miami, said he had consulted with five different law firms about how to
   respond to the no-match letters, which he said named 350 of his
   employees, or about a quarter of his staff. At the advice of several of
   those lawyers, he said, he is considering firing employees who cannot
   produce documentation. He has also hired a company to inspect the I-9
   forms of all future employees.

   Over the past few months, a number of his employees have left of their
   own accord, he said, concerned that the no-match letters could portend
   a federal immigration raid.

   The second owner, whose restaurant is in Manhattan, said she received a
   no-match letter alerting her to issues with almost every member of her
   kitchen staff, many of whom she had suspected were in the country
   illegally. Ultimately, she said, she decided not to tell any of her
   employees about the letter because losing the workers would doom the
   establishment.

   With unemployment at just 3.7 percent, its lowest level in many years,
   restaurants are hardly the only businesses struggling to recruit
   low-wage workers. But for them the labor shortage has become especially
   serious: Restaurants have long been the economy’s largest employer of
   teenagers, whose participation in the work force has declined in recent
   years; and Wall Street investment has led to a glut of restaurant
   openings, oversaturating the market.

   Many of the restaurant owners wringing their hands over the no-match
   letters run local eateries or small to midsize restaurant groups. The
   larger fast-food chains often require that their stores or franchisees
   use E-Verify, making them less likely to violate immigration law.

   Chipotle adopted the verification system after an immigration probe in
   2011 cut its work force in Minnesota in half. And over the last year,
   Dunkin’ has taken an especially hard line, suing franchisees that
   failed to use E-Verify.

   “You might start seeing more franchisers perhaps tightening up their
   employment verification requirements,” said Vikrant Advani, a labor
   expert at Rutgers University’s business school. “I see that possibly
   becoming a trend. Franchisers have to be careful.”

   At the moment, 22 states mandate that at least some businesses use
   E-Verify. It’s unclear, however, how many restaurants have adopted the
   system. United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency
   that oversees E-Verify, records the number of “food services and
   drinking places” that use it, but the agency does not keep track of
   restaurants specifically.

   In the last three years, the number of food-and-drink locations using
   E-Verify has increased steadily, by about 20,000 to 25,000 a year; a
   total of 218,375 such locations have signed up over the history of the
   program, according to government data. And even in some states that do
   not require it, E-Verify is growing more popular. In Iowa, the local
   chapter of the National Restaurant Association has not heard any
   reports of no-match letters, possibly because so many restaurants in
   the state already use E-Verify, according to Jessica Dunker, the
   chapter’s president.

   In New York, many small, independent restaurants have been reluctant to
   adopt the system because it can slow down the hiring process, putting
   employers at a competitive disadvantage. But now, some owners are
   starting to reconsider, as they wrestle with what to do about the
   no-match letters.

   “There’s a lot of liability for employers, so it puts them in a very
   difficult position to make very difficult choices,” said Andrew Rigie,
   the executive director of the city’s hospitality alliance. “Immigrants
   are the backbone of the city’s restaurant industry. There’s an
   incredible amount of anxiety.”

‘Transgender’ Could Be Defined Out of Existence Under Trump Administration

   WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is considering narrowly defining
   gender as a biological, immutable condition determined by genitalia at
   birth, the most drastic move yet in a governmentwide effort to roll
   back recognition and protections of transgender people under federal
   civil rights law.

   A series of decisions by the Obama administration loosened the legal
   concept of gender in federal programs, including in education and
   health care, recognizing gender largely as an individual’s choice and
   not determined by the sex assigned at birth. The policy prompted fights
   over bathrooms, dormitories, single-sex programs and other arenas where
   gender was once seen as a simple concept. Conservatives, especially
   evangelical Christians, were incensed.

   Now the Department of Health and Human Services is spearheading an
   effort to establish a legal definition of sex under Title IX, the
   federal civil rights law that bans gender discrimination in education
   programs that receive government financial assistance, according to a
   memo obtained by The New York Times.

   The department argued in its memo that key government agencies needed
   to adopt an explicit and uniform definition of gender as determined “on
   a biological basis that is clear, grounded in science, objective and
   administrable.” The agency’s proposed definition would define sex as
   either male or female, unchangeable, and determined by the genitals
   that a person is born with, according to a draft reviewed by The Times.
   Any dispute about one’s sex would have to be clarified using genetic
   testing.

   “Sex means a person’s status as male or female based on immutable
   biological traits identifiable by or before birth,” the department
   proposed in the memo, which was drafted and has been circulating since
   last spring. “The sex listed on a person’s birth certificate, as
   originally issued, shall constitute definitive proof of a person’s sex
   unless rebutted by reliable genetic evidence.”

   The new definition would essentially eradicate federal recognition of
   the estimated 1.4 million Americans who have opted to recognize
   themselves — surgically or otherwise — as a gender other than the one
   they were born into.

   “This takes a position that what the medical community understands
   about their patients — what people understand about themselves — is
   irrelevant because the government disagrees,” said Catherine E. Lhamon,
   who led the Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights in the Obama
   administration and helped write transgender guidance that is being
   undone.

   The move would be the most significant of a series of maneuvers, large
   and small, to exclude the population from civil rights protections and
   roll back the Obama administration’s more fluid recognition of gender
   identity. The Trump administration has sought to bar transgender people
   from serving in the military and has legally challenged civil rights
   protections for the group embedded in the nation’s health care law.

   Several agencies have withdrawn Obama-era policies that recognized
   gender identity in schools, prisons and homeless shelters. The
   administration even tried to remove questions about gender identity
   from a 2020 census survey and a national survey of elderly citizens.

   For the last year, the Department of Health and Human Services has
   privately argued that the term “sex” was never meant to include gender
   identity or even homosexuality, and that the lack of clarity allowed
   the Obama administration to wrongfully extend civil rights protections
   to people who should not have them.

   Services, was among the conservatives who blanched at the Obama
   administration’s expansion of sex to include gender identity.

   Roger Severino, the director of the Office for Civil Rights at the
   department, declined to answer detailed questions about the memo or his
   role in interagency discussions about how to revise the definition of
   sex under Title IX.

   But officials at the department confirmed that their push to limit the
   definition of sex for the purpose of federal civil rights laws resulted
   from their own reading of the laws and from a court decision.

   Mr. Severino, while serving as the head of the DeVos Center for
   Religion and Civil Society at the Heritage Foundation, was among the
   conservatives who blanched at the Obama administration’s expansion of
   sex to include gender identity, which he called “radical gender
   ideology.”

   In one commentary piece, he called the policies a “culmination of a
   series of unilateral, and frequently lawless, administration attempts
   to impose a new definition of what it means to be a man or a woman on
   the entire nation.”

   “Transgender people are frightened,” said Sarah Warbelow, the legal
   director of the Human Rights Campaign, which presses for the rights of
   lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. “At every step where the
   administration has had the choice, they’ve opted to turn their back on
   transgender people.” After this article was published online,
   transgender people took to social media to post photographs of
   themselves with the hashtag #WontBeErased.

   The Department of Health and Human Services has called on the “Big
   Four” agencies that enforce some part of Title IX — the Departments of
   Education, Justice, Health and Human Services, and Labor — to adopt its
   definition in regulations that will establish uniformity in the
   government and increase the likelihood that courts will accept it.

   The definition is integral to two proposed rules currently under review
   at the White House: One from the Education Department deals with
   complaints of sex discrimination at schools and colleges receiving
   federal financial assistance; the other, from health and human
   services, deals with health programs and activities that receive
   federal funds or subsidies. Both regulations are expected to be
   released this fall, and would then be open for public comment,
   typically for 60 days. The agencies would consider the comments before
   issuing final rules with the force of law — both of which could include
   the new gender definition.

   Civil rights groups have been meeting with federal officials in recent
   weeks to argue against the proposed definition, which has divided
   career and political appointees across the administration. Some
   officials hope that health and human services will at least rein in the
   most extreme parts, such as the call for genetic testing to determine
   sex.

   After more than a year of discussions, health and human services is
   preparing to formally present the new definition to the Justice
   Department before the end of the year, Trump administration officials
   say. If the Justice Department decides that the change is legal, the
   new definition can be approved and enforced in Title IX statutes, and
   across government agencies.

   The Justice Department declined to comment on the draft health and
   human services proposal. The Justice Department has not yet been asked
   to render a formal legal opinion, according to an official there who
   was not authorized to speak about the process.

   But Attorney General Jeff Sessions’s previous decisions on transgender
   protections have given civil rights advocates little hope that the
   department will prevent the new definition from being enforced. The
   proposal appears consistent with the position he took in an October
   2017 memo sent to agencies clarifying that the civil rights law that
   prohibits job discrimination does not cover “gender identity, per se.”

   Harper Jean Tobin, the policy director of the National Center for
   Transgender Equality, an advocacy group, called the maneuvering “an
   extremely aggressive legal position that is inconsistent with dozens of
   federal court decisions.”

   [Two weeks before the midterms, transgender people say they feel like
   ‘pawns.’]

   Health and human services officials said they were only abiding by
   court orders, referring to the rulings of Judge Reed O’Connor of the
   Federal District Court in Fort Worth, Tex., a George W. Bush appointee
   who has held that “Congress did not understand ‘sex’ to include ‘gender
   identity.’”

   A 2016 ruling by Judge O’Connor concerned a rule that was adopted to
   carry out a civil rights statute embedded in the Affordable Care Act.
   The provision prohibits discrimination based on race, color, national
   origin, sex, age or disability in “any health program or activity” that
   receives federal financial assistance.

   But in recent discussions with the administration, civil rights groups,
   including Lambda Legal, have pointed to other court cases. In a legal
   memo presented to the administration, a coalition of civil rights
   groups wrote, “The overwhelming majority of courts to address the
   question since the most relevant Supreme Court precedent in 1998 have
   held that antitransgender bias constitutes sex discrimination under
   federal laws like Title IX.”

   Indeed, the health and human services proposal was prompted, in part,
   by pro-transgender court decisions in the last year that upheld the
   Obama administration’s position.

   In their memo, health and human services officials wrote that “courts
   and plaintiffs are racing to get decisions” ahead of any rule-making,
   because of the lack of a stand-alone definition.

   “Courts and the previous administration took advantage of this
   circumstance to include gender identity and sexual orientation in a
   multitude of agencies, and under a multitude of laws,” the memo states.
   Doing so “led to confusion and negative policy consequences in health
   care, education and other federal contexts.”

   The narrower definition would be acutely felt in schools and their most
   visible battlegrounds: locker rooms and bathrooms.

   One of the Trump administration’s first decisive policy acts was the
   rescission by the Education and Justice Departments of Obama-era
   guidelines that protected transgender students who wanted to use
   bathrooms that correspond to their gender identity.

   Since the guidance was rescinded, the Education Department’s Office for
   Civil Rights has halted and dismissed discrimination cases filed by
   transgender students over access to school facilities. A restrictive
   governmentwide definition would cement the Education Department’s
   current approach.

   But it would also raise new questions.

   The department would have to decide what documentation schools would be
   required to collect to determine or codify gender. Title IX applies to
   a number of educational experiences, like sports and single-sex classes
   or programs where gender identity has come into play. The department
   has said it will continue to open cases where transgender students face
   discrimination, bullying and harassment, and investigate gender-based
   harassment as “unwelcome conduct based on a student’s sex” or
   “harassing conduct based on a student’s failure to conform to sex
   stereotypes.”

   The Education Department did not respond to an inquiry about the health
   and human services proposal.

   Ms. Lhamon of the Obama Education Department said the proposed
   definition “quite simply negates the humanity of people.”

The Sisters Who First Tried to Take Down Jeffrey Epstein

   Nine years before any police investigation, Maria and Annie Farmer
   reported the troubling behavior of Jeffrey Epstein and his companion,
   Ghislaine Maxwell. No one would act.

   As more women have come forward in recent days to describe assaults at
   the hands of Jeffrey Epstein, Maria Farmer finds herself distraught,
   wondering what might have happened if someone had taken her seriously.

   Twenty-four years ago, Ms. Farmer was an artist who had entered the
   unorthodox life Mr. Epstein lived behind the doors of his luxury
   estates. Mr. Epstein had offered to help her painting career, but it
   all came to an abrupt end one night in the summer of 1996, when she
   says Mr. Epstein and his companion, Ghislaine Maxwell, began violently
   groping her.

   She learned later that her 16-year-old sister, Annie Farmer, had been
   subjected to a troubling topless massage at Mr. Epstein’s ranch in New
   Mexico.

   [Several of Mr. Epstein’s accusers spoke at a hearing. “Justice has
   never been served in this case,” one said.]

   Ms. Farmer contacted the New York Police Department, and said she then
   went to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, offering to share what she
   knew about Mr. Epstein and the parade of young women being brought to
   Mr. Epstein’s houses. Though the bureau has never acknowledged such a
   contact, Ms. Farmer said the F.B.I. must have had a record of it,
   because agents came back to her — years later — with questions. She
   also went to leaders in the New York art world that Mr. Epstein and Ms.
   Maxwell frequented, and the sisters tried to tell their story to a
   national magazine.

   In each case, their reports went nowhere.

   Finally, facing what she said were threats as a result of the sisters’
   claims, Ms. Farmer abandoned her New York art career and stopped
   painting altogether.

   “I did not want another young lady to go through what Annie went
   through,” Maria Farmer said in a recent interview. “I could handle what
   happened to me. I could not handle what happened to her.”

   Mr. Epstein would continue to lure vulnerable girls into his predatory
   circle for another nine years before investigators began diving deep
   into his world. After being arrested on federal charges of sex
   trafficking of minors in New York and Florida, Mr. Epstein died earlier
   this month in what the authorities said was an apparent suicide.

   [Listen to “The Daily” episode on the Farmer sisters and Jeffrey
   Epstein.]

   Other women have come forward in recent years with even more serious
   claims of rape and child abuse against Mr. Epstein, but the Farmer
   sisters’ reports — made 23 years ago — are the earliest known
   allegations about Mr. Epstein’s troubling physical contact with girls
   and young women. In their detailed accounts, told here for the first
   time, they offer a glimpse of how Mr. Epstein managed to avoid
   significant scrutiny for years, even as concerns about his conduct
   began to pile up.

   Ms. Farmer said that she feels guilty about having brought her sister
   into Mr. Epstein’s orbit. She mourns the victims who came after her,
   she said, her voice cracking each time she mentioned the name of one of
   them. She has spent years trying to live in seclusion.

The First Meeting

   Ms. Farmer moved to New York in 1993, eager to pursue her passion for
   art, and enrolled at the New York Academy of Art.

   She already had a specialty, exploring figures of nudes and
   adolescents, and had a chance to train under one of her idols, the
   painter and sculptor Eric Fischl. One of her paintings was done in a
   voyeuristic style, showing a man in the frame of a doorway looking at a
   woman on a sofa — a painting she said was inspired by Edgar Degas’s
   famous piece “Interior,” which is sometimes known as “The Rape.”

   At a gallery show for her graduation, Ms. Farmer said, the dean of the
   academy, Eileen Guggenheim, introduced her to Mr. Epstein and Ms.
   Maxwell, and told her to sell them the painting with the man in the
   doorway at a discount. (Ms. Guggenheim said she did not recall such an
   interaction.)

   Afterward, Ms. Farmer said, Mr. Epstein called her to offer her a job
   acquiring art on his behalf, and later managing the entrance to a
   townhouse he was renovating.

   There, at the age of 25, she was introduced to Mr. Epstein’s odd life,
   with girls and young women coming through for what she recalled Ms.
   Maxwell describing as modeling auditions for the lingerie retailer
   Victoria’s Secret. The house at times bustled in anticipation of
   potential visits from Bill Clinton, although she never actually saw him
   there.

   She said she met Donald J. Trump one day in Mr. Epstein’s office,
   recalling Mr. Trump eyeing her before Mr. Epstein informed him that
   “she’s not for you.” Ms. Farmer’s mother, Janice Swain, recalled her
   daughter detailing the interaction with Mr. Trump around the time it
   occurred.

   Both Mr. Clinton and Mr. Trump have acknowledged knowing Mr. Epstein,
   with Mr. Clinton denying knowledge of anything improper and Mr. Trump
   saying he was “not a fan” of Mr. Epstein.

   Ms. Maxwell was charming and friendly, Ms. Farmer said, and as Mr.
   Epstein’s companion, she offered young women a level of assurance that
   they were safe in his presence. But she also seemed to play an
   important role in bringing young women in, Ms. Farmer said, recalling
   that Ms. Maxwell would leave the house saying, “I’ve got to go get
   girls for Jeffrey.”

   Ms. Maxwell would refer to the girls she was looking for as “nubiles,”
   Ms. Farmer said. “They had a driver, and he would be driving along, and
   Ghislaine would say, ‘Get that girl,’” she said. “And they’d stop, and
   she’d run out and get the girl and talk to her.”

   Lawyers for Ms. Maxwell and Mr. Epstein did not respond to requests for
   comment for this article.

The Younger Sister

   when she was 16.CreditTamir Kalifa for The New York Times

   One of the girls in whom the couple took an interest was Ms. Farmer’s
   younger sister Annie.

   Ms. Farmer had mentioned to them that her sister was looking to go to
   college. Mr. Epstein offered to help, and brought Annie, then 16 years
   old and living in Arizona, to visit New York.

   Annie Farmer said she recalled Mr. Epstein as kind and casual, wearing
   sweatpants, pouring champagne and talking about her college plans.
   During the trip, they all went to see a movie. As the film progressed,
   Mr. Epstein began rubbing Annie’s hand, and then her lower leg, she
   said.

   “It was one of those things that just gave me a weird feeling but
   wasn’t that weird + probably normal,” Ms. Farmer wrote in a diary entry
   dated Jan. 25, 1996. “The one thing that kind of weirded me out about
   it was he let go of my hand when he was talking to Maria.”

   Mr. Epstein offered to send Annie Farmer on a trip to Thailand, and
   invited her to his New Mexico ranch for a weekend. Under the impression
   that the gathering would include a number of students chaperoned by Ms.
   Maxwell, Annie’s mother, Ms. Swain, said she allowed Annie to go. But
   when she arrived in New Mexico, Annie said, it was just her and Mr.
   Epstein and Ms. Maxwell.

   There were more uncomfortable interactions that weekend, she said. She
   recalled Ms. Maxwell persuading her to give Mr. Epstein a foot massage
   and then giving pointers as she performed it. They went to another
   movie, where Mr. Epstein continued another round of his petting
   touches, she said.

   Then, when she woke up in the house one morning, she recalled him
   coming into the room, saying he wanted to cuddle, and getting into bed
   next to her.

   Ms. Farmer also recalled Ms. Maxwell repeatedly asking whether she
   wanted a massage. Eventually relenting, Ms. Farmer followed directions
   by taking off her clothes and bra and getting under a sheet on a
   massage table. Ms. Maxwell performed the massage, at one point having
   Ms. Farmer lie on her back as Ms. Maxwell pulled down the sheet to
   massage her chest.

   “I don’t think there was any reason for her to be touching me that
   way,” Ms. Farmer said.

   Mr. Epstein did not participate, but Ms. Farmer said she could sense
   that he was in the area and possibly watching.

The First Reports

   Epstein.

   At the time, Maria Farmer was unaware of the interactions her younger
   sister had in New Mexico. She went to Ohio around that time to focus on
   her paintings, utilizing Mr. Epstein’s large estate there. The
   residence was inside a complex developed by Les Wexner, the chief
   executive of L Brands, the parent company of Victoria’s Secret.

   Later in the summer, Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell paid a visit. One
   night, she recalled getting an unusual request: Mr. Epstein needed his
   feet massaged.

   The foot massage was brief and awkward, Ms. Farmer recalled, as Mr.
   Epstein groaned with what seemed like exaggerated pleasure, followed by
   a yelp of pain. Then he invited her to sit on the bed, where he was
   watching a PBS program about math.

   Ms. Maxwell joined them on the bed, Ms. Farmer said, and the night took
   a sudden turn: Both Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell began groping Ms.
   Farmer over her clothes, rubbing her body, commenting on her features,
   and twisting her nipples to the point of bruising. She said they did so
   in unison, mirroring each other’s movements. Fearing that she was about
   to be raped, Ms. Farmer eventually fled the room and barricaded herself
   in another part of the house.

   She soon discovered that three nude photographs she had kept in a
   storage box were missing. The photos were of Annie and a third Farmer
   sister, who was 12, modeling for Maria’s figurative paintings.

   Ms. Farmer said she began phoning people in a panic, looking for help.
   One of the people she reached was her art mentor, Mr. Fischl. In an
   interview, he recalled Ms. Farmer describing a physical encounter in
   the bedroom, fear for her sister and outrage about the missing
   photographs.

   “I just kept telling Maria, ‘You’ve got to get out of there. You’ve got
   to get out of there,’” Mr. Fischl said.

   Maria’s father, Frank Farmer, also recalled getting a call. He did not
   know the specifics of what transpired, but said his daughter was upset
   enough that he drove to the estate in Ohio from Kentucky to get her.

   After speaking with Annie and learning that Annie had had her own
   troubles with Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell, Maria Farmer said, she
   returned to New York. She recalled getting a phone call from Ms.
   Maxwell, saying she planned to burn all of Ms. Farmer’s art and that
   her career was over. Frightened, Ms. Farmer said she went to a local
   police precinct to report what had happened to her in Ohio, and about
   the art.

   Officers at the New York Police Department precinct took a report on
   the purported threat and on the art theft allegation, a copy of which
   was obtained by The New York Times. But they referred her to other
   agencies, including the F.B.I., concerning the assault allegation
   because Ohio was outside their jurisdiction, Ms. Farmer said.

   Ms. Farmer said she called the F.B.I. and spoke for about half an hour
   with the agent who answered the phone. The agent did not say what would
   happen with her report, she said. She asked if she should phone other
   law enforcement officials in individual states, like Ohio and New
   Mexico, and was told that was “up to you,” she said. She recalled
   contacting at least one other jurisdiction — she did not remember which
   — and making no progress.

   An F.B.I. spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the agency had a
   report of such a call from Ms. Farmer in its files.

   In recent days, the art collector Stuart Pivar said he recalled running
   into Ms. Farmer at a flea market around that time, and hearing her
   discuss serious concerns about Mr. Epstein that she said she had
   reported to law enforcement.

   Ms. Farmer said she also raised her concerns about Mr. Epstein with
   leaders in the art community, including Ms. Guggenheim, the dean at the
   art school who had first put her in touch with Mr. Epstein. But she
   said Ms. Guggenheim did not seem to take the issue seriously. Ms.
   Guggenheim said in an interview that the details she was aware of at
   the time did not rise to a level that would require intervention.

   The two Farmer sisters made another run at telling their story in 2003
   to Vicky Ward, a reporter for Vanity Fair, which had commissioned an
   article about Mr. Epstein’s complicated finances that would also
   mention his proclivity for young girls. The article was published with
   no mention of the Farmers, and they felt they were left badly exposed.

   Ms. Ward wrote on her personal blog in 2011 that the article went in a
   different direction because of “not knowing quite whom to believe.” The
   editor, Graydon Carter, said in an email that Ms. Ward’s sourcing on
   the Farmers’ account did not meet the magazine’s legal standards. But
   Ms. Ward indicated on Twitter recently that she believed that Mr.
   Carter had succumbed to pressure from Mr. Epstein. John Connolly, a
   former contributing editor at Vanity Fair, said he recalled Mr. Carter
   talking about the efforts Mr. Epstein had made to influence the
   article.

   When word got out that the sisters had given a detailed interview to
   the magazine, the angry phone calls to her resumed, Ms. Farmer said.

   “Better be careful and watch your back,” she said Ms. Maxwell told her.
   “She said, ‘I know you go to the West Side Highway all the time. While
   you’re out there, just be really careful because there are a lot of
   ways to die there.’”

The Aftermath

   Ms. Farmer said the threats led her to abandon her life in the New York
   art scene, where Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell still held considerable
   sway. While Annie has moved forward with life, obtaining a Ph.D. and
   working as a psychotherapist, Ms. Farmer struggled to move past the
   year she spent with Mr. Epstein. She felt sickened by her own
   paintings, which she realized Mr. Epstein had apparently appreciated
   not for their artistic value, but for their depiction of nude forms of
   girls.

   Unable to forget the comments Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell had made
   about her breasts, Ms. Farmer said she underwent breast reduction
   surgery.

   It was not until 2006, when F.B.I. agents knocked on her door in North
   Carolina, that Ms. Farmer found renewed hope that Mr. Epstein would be
   held accountable. New allegations about Mr. Epstein had surfaced the
   previous year, when a report by a teenager in Florida spurred an
   extensive investigation that uncovered a wide range of young girls who
   had been recruited to visit Mr. Epstein’s lavish home in Palm Beach.

   Heavily redacted records released by the F.B.I. appear to show
   handwritten notes from November 2006 interviews with Maria Farmer and
   Annie Farmer, outlining key details of their stories, including Maria’s
   visit to the New York police and her referral to the F.B.I.

   But though the investigation progressed, a widely criticized plea deal
   eventually quashed any federal prosecution. To the sisters, the 2008
   plea agreement, which allowed Mr. Epstein to plead guilty merely to
   much less serious state charges, was deeply demoralizing.

   Ms. Farmer was starting to put some of it behind her when the latest
   news about Mr. Epstein began to emerge, and more victims began coming
   forward. She found herself crying when she saw those accounts,
   wondering what it would have taken to stop him when she first tried.
   Though the time for a lawsuit has long passed, she has been working
   with a lawyer, David Boies, to support other victims of Mr. Epstein.

   “Every time I hear one of the girls tell their story, it devastates
   me,” Ms. Farmer said.

   Ms. Farmer, who recently received a diagnosis of a brain tumor, said
   she still had some fear about coming forward to tell her own story,
   even after Mr. Epstein’s death. She recently moved to a new home in the
   South to improve her privacy.

   In her new residence, she has laid out an art studio in front of
   windows that offer a peek-a-boo view of a nearby lake. She has started
   painting again, for the first time in years, and new pieces are stacked
   up against the walls.

   One day, she said, she will try to bring artistic shape to her
   experience with Mr. Epstein. But for now, she has been focused on a
   series of paintings of families and children.

   They are not like her earlier paintings, the ones Mr. Epstein liked.
   All the girls are clothed.

Hiring Is Very Hard for Restaurants These Days. Now They May Have to Fire.

   Amid a severe labor shortage and a renewed U.S. crackdown on
   undocumented immigrants, owners are facing a choice: fire workers or
   risk prosecution.

   Facing one of the most severe labor shortages in decades, restaurants
   across the country are trying virtually everything to recruit cooks and
   dishwashers, from offering quarterly bonuses to providing training
   programs for ex-convicts.

   Now, the specter of increased immigration enforcement is putting many
   of those restaurants in a more fraught situation: let go of trusted
   employees or risk criminal prosecution.

   The problems began in March and April, when the Social Security
   Administration sent letters to hundreds of thousands of business
   owners, notifying them that the names of some employees did not match
   the Social Security numbers on their tax forms.

   These “no-match letters” sowed fear and confusion in workplaces that
   depend on immigrant employees, like farms, factories and construction
   sites. But few businesses have felt the impact of the government
   notices more than restaurants, which have long relied on undocumented
   labor and struggled with high turnover.

   “If you ask any restaurant now what’s keeping them up at night, it’s
   this,” said Carolyn Richmond, an employment lawyer in New York. “We do
   have a lot more diverse work force than most industries, and
   unfortunately many of them may be undocumented.”

   Over the last few months, the restaurant owners who received no-match
   letters have divided into two general camps. Some risk-averse employers
   are planning to fire their undocumented workers or adopt more stringent
   hiring protocols, like using the federal E-Verify program to check new
   hires’ documents. Others have done practically nothing, convinced that
   they have no choice but to ignore the notices because they can ill
   afford to lose employees in a tight labor market.

   After the no-match letters arrived, many restaurant owners were advised
   by their lawyers to give affected employees a few months to correct the
   problems in the government’s records.

   For some restaurants, the end of that window has already arrived or is
   fast approaching. That could mean a wave of firings is in store, once
   it becomes clear that certain employees lack legal status. But with
   restaurants already struggling to hire enough workers, some owners are
   likely to ignore the letters, putting themselves at risk of legal
   penalties.

   “We’ve definitely seen every part of the spectrum, from wanting to be
   compliant to ‘we’re just going to stick our heads in the sand,’” said
   Becki Young, a lawyer in Maryland who has advised restaurants across
   the country on how to respond to the no-match letters. “Some of our
   clients will have some really hard decisions to make.”

   A no-match letter from the Social Security Administration is not the
   same as an immigration audit, which would be conducted by Immigration
   and Customs Enforcement. And some of the Social Security discrepancies
   involve minor clerical issues, like a missing digit or a spelling
   mistake in an employee’s name.

   “Social Security is not a law enforcement agency,” said Mark Hinkle,
   the agency’s acting press secretary. “Our role is limited in scope to
   trying to ensure we credit each employee with his or her earnings.”

   But the letters effectively require business owners to check whether
   the employees identified are properly documented. And in a potential
   ICE audit, employers who fail to investigate a no-match letter — or to
   act on what they find — could be deemed to have “constructive
   knowledge” of an employee’s immigration status, exposing them to hefty
   fines and possible criminal charges.

   The last time the federal government sent a large number of no-match
   letters was more than a decade ago, when President George W. Bush was
   in office. Amid a broader crackdown on illegal immigration, the Trump
   administration has revived the process, at the same time that ICE has
   upped the frequency of its audits. In fiscal 2018, the agency initiated
   nearly 6,000 I-9 audits, a more than 400 percent increase from the
   previous year. And the ICE raids in Mississippi this month, which swept
   up hundreds of undocumented employees at agricultural plants,
   underscored the specter of increased enforcement across the food
   industry.

   The experiences of two restaurant owners in New York City show how the
   pressures that face the industry have elicited strikingly divergent
   responses. The owners spoke on condition of anonymity because they did
   not want to attract attention from ICE.

   One of them, who owns a restaurant group with locations in New York and
   Miami, said he had consulted with five different law firms about how to
   respond to the no-match letters, which he said named 350 of his
   employees, or about a quarter of his staff. At the advice of several of
   those lawyers, he said, he is considering firing employees who cannot
   produce documentation. He has also hired a company to inspect the I-9
   forms of all future employees.

   Over the past few months, a number of his employees have left of their
   own accord, he said, concerned that the no-match letters could portend
   a federal immigration raid.

   The second owner, whose restaurant is in Manhattan, said she received a
   no-match letter alerting her to issues with almost every member of her
   kitchen staff, many of whom she had suspected were in the country
   illegally. Ultimately, she said, she decided not to tell any of her
   employees about the letter because losing the workers would doom the
   establishment.

   With unemployment at just 3.7 percent, its lowest level in many years,
   restaurants are hardly the only businesses struggling to recruit
   low-wage workers. But for them the labor shortage has become especially
   serious: Restaurants have long been the economy’s largest employer of
   teenagers, whose participation in the work force has declined in recent
   years; and Wall Street investment has led to a glut of restaurant
   openings, oversaturating the market.

   Many of the restaurant owners wringing their hands over the no-match
   letters run local eateries or small to midsize restaurant groups. The
   larger fast-food chains often require that their stores or franchisees
   use E-Verify, making them less likely to violate immigration law.

   Chipotle adopted the verification system after an immigration probe in
   2011 cut its work force in Minnesota in half. And over the last year,
   Dunkin’ has taken an especially hard line, suing franchisees that
   failed to use E-Verify.

   “You might start seeing more franchisers perhaps tightening up their
   employment verification requirements,” said Vikrant Advani, a labor
   expert at Rutgers University’s business school. “I see that possibly
   becoming a trend. Franchisers have to be careful.”

   At the moment, 22 states mandate that at least some businesses use
   E-Verify. It’s unclear, however, how many restaurants have adopted the
   system. United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency
   that oversees E-Verify, records the number of “food services and
   drinking places” that use it, but the agency does not keep track of
   restaurants specifically.

   In the last three years, the number of food-and-drink locations using
   E-Verify has increased steadily, by about 20,000 to 25,000 a year; a
   total of 218,375 such locations have signed up over the history of the
   program, according to government data. And even in some states that do
   not require it, E-Verify is growing more popular. In Iowa, the local
   chapter of the National Restaurant Association has not heard any
   reports of no-match letters, possibly because so many restaurants in
   the state already use E-Verify, according to Jessica Dunker, the
   chapter’s president.

   In New York, many small, independent restaurants have been reluctant to
   adopt the system because it can slow down the hiring process, putting
   employers at a competitive disadvantage. But now, some owners are
   starting to reconsider, as they wrestle with what to do about the
   no-match letters.

   “There’s a lot of liability for employers, so it puts them in a very
   difficult position to make very difficult choices,” said Andrew Rigie,
   the executive director of the city’s hospitality alliance. “Immigrants
   are the backbone of the city’s restaurant industry. There’s an
   incredible amount of anxiety.”

   WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is considering narrowly defining
   gender as a biological, immutable condition determined by genitalia at
   birth, the most drastic move yet in a governmentwide effort to roll
   back recognition and protections of transgender people under federal
   civil rights law.

   A series of decisions by the Obama administration loosened the legal
   concept of gender in federal programs, including in education and
   health care, recognizing gender largely as an individual’s choice and
   not determined by the sex assigned at birth. The policy prompted fights
   over bathrooms, dormitories, single-sex programs and other arenas where
   gender was once seen as a simple concept. Conservatives, especially
   evangelical Christians, were incensed.

   Now the Department of Health and Human Services is spearheading an
   effort to establish a legal definition of sex under Title IX, the
   federal civil rights law that bans gender discrimination in education
   programs that receive government financial assistance, according to a
   memo obtained by The New York Times.

   The department argued in its memo that key government agencies needed
   to adopt an explicit and uniform definition of gender as determined “on
   a biological basis that is clear, grounded in science, objective and
   administrable.” The agency’s proposed definition would define sex as
   either male or female, unchangeable, and determined by the genitals
   that a person is born with, according to a draft reviewed by The Times.
   Any dispute about one’s sex would have to be clarified using genetic
   testing.

   “Sex means a person’s status as male or female based on immutable
   biological traits identifiable by or before birth,” the department
   proposed in the memo, which was drafted and has been circulating since
   last spring. “The sex listed on a person’s birth certificate, as
   originally issued, shall constitute definitive proof of a person’s sex
   unless rebutted by reliable genetic evidence.”

   The new definition would essentially eradicate federal recognition of
   the estimated 1.4 million Americans who have opted to recognize
   themselves — surgically or otherwise — as a gender other than the one
   they were born into.

   “This takes a position that what the medical community understands
   about their patients — what people understand about themselves — is
   irrelevant because the government disagrees,” said Catherine E. Lhamon,
   who led the Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights in the Obama
   administration and helped write transgender guidance that is being
   undone.

   The move would be the most significant of a series of maneuvers, large
   and small, to exclude the population from civil rights protections and
   roll back the Obama administration’s more fluid recognition of gender
   identity. The Trump administration has sought to bar transgender people
   from serving in the military and has legally challenged civil rights
   protections for the group embedded in the nation’s health care law.

   Several agencies have withdrawn Obama-era policies that recognized
   gender identity in schools, prisons and homeless shelters. The
   administration even tried to remove questions about gender identity
   from a 2020 census survey and a national survey of elderly citizens.

   For the last year, the Department of Health and Human Services has
   privately argued that the term “sex” was never meant to include gender
   identity or even homosexuality, and that the lack of clarity allowed
   the Obama administration to wrongfully extend civil rights protections
   to people who should not have them.

   Roger Severino, the director of the Office for Civil Rights at the
   department, declined to answer detailed questions about the memo or his
   role in interagency discussions about how to revise the definition of
   sex under Title IX.

   But officials at the department confirmed that their push to limit the
   definition of sex for the purpose of federal civil rights laws resulted
   from their own reading of the laws and from a court decision.

   Mr. Severino, while serving as the head of the DeVos Center for
   Religion and Civil Society at the Heritage Foundation, was among the
   conservatives who blanched at the Obama administration’s expansion of
   sex to include gender identity, which he called “radical gender
   ideology.”

   In one commentary piece, he called the policies a “culmination of a
   series of unilateral, and frequently lawless, administration attempts
   to impose a new definition of what it means to be a man or a woman on
   the entire nation.”

   “Transgender people are frightened,” said Sarah Warbelow, the legal
   director of the Human Rights Campaign, which presses for the rights of
   lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. “At every step where the
   administration has had the choice, they’ve opted to turn their back on
   transgender people.” After this article was published online,
   transgender people took to social media to post photographs of
   themselves with the hashtag #WontBeErased.

   The Department of Health and Human Services has called on the “Big
   Four” agencies that enforce some part of Title IX — the Departments of
   Education, Justice, Health and Human Services, and Labor — to adopt its
   definition in regulations that will establish uniformity in the
   government and increase the likelihood that courts will accept it.

   The definition is integral to two proposed rules currently under review
   at the White House: One from the Education Department deals with
   complaints of sex discrimination at schools and colleges receiving
   federal financial assistance; the other, from health and human
   services, deals with health programs and activities that receive
   federal funds or subsidies. Both regulations are expected to be
   released this fall, and would then be open for public comment,
   typically for 60 days. The agencies would consider the comments before
   issuing final rules with the force of law — both of which could include
   the new gender definition.

   Civil rights groups have been meeting with federal officials in recent
   weeks to argue against the proposed definition, which has divided
   career and political appointees across the administration. Some
   officials hope that health and human services will at least rein in the
   most extreme parts, such as the call for genetic testing to determine
   sex.

   After more than a year of discussions, health and human services is
   preparing to formally present the new definition to the Justice
   Department before the end of the year, Trump administration officials
   say. If the Justice Department decides that the change is legal, the
   new definition can be approved and enforced in Title IX statutes, and
   across government agencies.

   The Justice Department declined to comment on the draft health and
   human services proposal. The Justice Department has not yet been asked
   to render a formal legal opinion, according to an official there who
   was not authorized to speak about the process.

   But Attorney General Jeff Sessions’s previous decisions on transgender
   protections have given civil rights advocates little hope that the
   department will prevent the new definition from being enforced. The
   proposal appears consistent with the position he took in an October
   2017 memo sent to agencies clarifying that the civil rights law that
   prohibits job discrimination does not cover “gender identity, per se.”

   Harper Jean Tobin, the policy director of the National Center for
   Transgender Equality, an advocacy group, called the maneuvering “an
   extremely aggressive legal position that is inconsistent with dozens of
   federal court decisions.”

   [Two weeks before the midterms, transgender people say they feel like
   ‘pawns.’]

   Health and human services officials said they were only abiding by
   court orders, referring to the rulings of Judge Reed O’Connor of the
   Federal District Court in Fort Worth, Tex., a George W. Bush appointee
   who has held that “Congress did not understand ‘sex’ to include ‘gender
   identity.’”

   A 2016 ruling by Judge O’Connor concerned a rule that was adopted to
   carry out a civil rights statute embedded in the Affordable Care Act.
   The provision prohibits discrimination based on race, color, national
   origin, sex, age or disability in “any health program or activity” that
   receives federal financial assistance.

   But in recent discussions with the administration, civil rights groups,
   including Lambda Legal, have pointed to other court cases. In a legal
   memo presented to the administration, a coalition of civil rights
   groups wrote, “The overwhelming majority of courts to address the
   question since the most relevant Supreme Court precedent in 1998 have
   held that antitransgender bias constitutes sex discrimination under
   federal laws like Title IX.”

   Indeed, the health and human services proposal was prompted, in part,
   by pro-transgender court decisions in the last year that upheld the
   Obama administration’s position.

   In their memo, health and human services officials wrote that “courts
   and plaintiffs are racing to get decisions” ahead of any rule-making,
   because of the lack of a stand-alone definition.

   “Courts and the previous administration took advantage of this
   circumstance to include gender identity and sexual orientation in a
   multitude of agencies, and under a multitude of laws,” the memo states.
   Doing so “led to confusion and negative policy consequences in health
   care, education and other federal contexts.”

   The narrower definition would be acutely felt in schools and their most
   visible battlegrounds: locker rooms and bathrooms.

   One of the Trump administration’s first decisive policy acts was the
   rescission by the Education and Justice Departments of Obama-era
   guidelines that protected transgender students who wanted to use
   bathrooms that correspond to their gender identity.

   Since the guidance was rescinded, the Education Department’s Office for
   Civil Rights has halted and dismissed discrimination cases filed by
   transgender students over access to school facilities. A restrictive
   governmentwide definition would cement the Education Department’s
   current approach.

   But it would also raise new questions.

   The department would have to decide what documentation schools would be
   required to collect to determine or codify gender. Title IX applies to
   a number of educational experiences, like sports and single-sex classes
   or programs where gender identity has come into play. The department
   has said it will continue to open cases where transgender students face
   discrimination, bullying and harassment, and investigate gender-based
   harassment as “unwelcome conduct based on a student’s sex” or
   “harassing conduct based on a student’s failure to conform to sex
   stereotypes.”

   The Education Department did not respond to an inquiry about the health
   and human services proposal.

   Ms. Lhamon of the Obama Education Department said the proposed
   definition “quite simply negates the humanity of people.”
