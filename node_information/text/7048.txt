Gateway to the Vercors, Sassenage, Vif

   At the foot of the towering limestone cliffs of the Vercors spreads a
   rich and diverse territory. As part of the Vercors Regional Park, these
   protected areas are the ideal backdrop for a hike. Follow the marked
   paths, climb up a bit, and admire the sprawling city of Grenoble at
   your feet. Somewhere in between history and nature, discover the
   must-see sites like the Chateau and Cisterns of Sassenage. Of course,
   wild natural places await as well, places steeped in legend like the
   mysterious Ardente Fountain…
