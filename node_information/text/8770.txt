Viola Davis to Return as Amanda Waller in James Gunn’s ‘The Suicide Squad’
(Exclusive)

   Sequel to 2016's "Suicide Squad" will hit theaters Aug. 6, 2021
   Umberto Gonzalez | April 5, 2019 @ 9:01 AM

   Oscar, Tony, and Emmy winner Viola Davis will return as Amanda Waller
   in James Gunn’s “The Suicide Squad,” an individual with knowledge of
   the project exclusively told TheWrap.

   The sequel to 2016’s “Suicide Squad” will hit theaters on Aug. 6, 2021.
   Peter Safran and Charles Roven are producing.

   “Guardians of the Galaxy” director Gunn was brought on board to helm
   the project. He also wrote the script and will have a completely new
   take on the property, in which DC supervillains are recruited by the
   government to carry out secret missions too dirty for the likes of
   Superman and Batman.

   'Suicide Squad' Sequel

   “Suicide Squad” was directed and written by David Ayer and starred Will
   Smith, Margot Robbie, Viola Davis, Jared Leto, Ezra Miller, Jai
   Courtney, Jay Hernandez, Cara Delevingne and Joel Kinnaman.

   It grossed $325 million domestically and almost $750 million worldwide,
   although it was mostly panned by critics.

   Davis previously told Nerd Report that she is”fascinated by the
   character,” who serves the DC Universe in a similar capacity as Samuel
   L. Jackson’s Nick Fury in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

   Waller is described as “a former congressional aide and government
   agent who is often placed in charge of the Suicide Squad, a semi-secret
   government-run group of former super villains working in return for
   amnesty.”

   Davis currently headlines the ABC hit “How to Get Away With Murder” and
   starred in “The Help,” “Fences,” and 2018’s “Widows.”

   Davis is repped by CAA, Lasher Group and Lichter, Grossman, Nichols,
   Adler & Feldman Inc.

   Warner Bros. did not respond to request for comment.

Christopher Nolan’s ‘Tenet': Trippy First Trailer Makes Surprise Debut Before
‘Hobbs & Shaw’

   Read what it's like here
   Ross A. Lincoln | August 1, 2019 @ 9:55 PM

   Moviegoers got a surprise on Thursday, as multiple fans reported that
   the first trailer for Christopher Nolan’s spy thriller “Tenet” debuted
   unannounced before screenings of “Hobbs & Shaw.”

   The trailer hasn’t yet been posted online by Warner Bros., but dozens
   of cell phone recordings quickly made their way online. We won’t link
   to them (and many were quickly disabled “in response to a report by the
   copyright owner”), but for those who want to know, the trailer begins
   with the taglines “Time has come for a new protagonist” and “Time has
   come for a new kind of mission,” as footage shows star John David
   Washington on the other side of a thick window that appears to be an
   interrogation room or some other dank, law enforcement space.

   He walks toward what appears to be the impact of an attempt to shoot
   through the glass. There’s a flash of the film’s logo, a shot of
   Washington in what appears to be some kind of confining space, scenes
   of someone running in a gas mask, and a clip of Washington trying to
   hit someone, then being dragged down a dimly lit corridor. The clip
   ends with Washington apparently tied up in a chair, with some kind of
   anesthesia apparatus on his face. It concludes with the film’s July 17,
   2020 release date.

   Warner Bros. didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment or
   information about when the trailer will appear online.

   Along with Washington, “Tenet” stars Robert Pattinson, Elizabeth
   Debicki, Dimple Kapadia, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Clémence Poésy, Michael
   Caine, and Kenneth Branagh.

   Nolan writes and well as directs, and produces alongside Emma Thomas.

Beyond Bond: Roger Moore's 7 Most Memorable Non-007 Roles, From 'The Saint'
to 'Spice World' (Photos)

   1 of 10

   British actor died Tuesday at age 89

   Roger Moore, who died Tuesday at age 89, is best remembered for playing
   superspy James Bond in seven movies from 1973 to 1985. But he had a
   storied career in Hollywood before and after his record turn as 007.
   2 of 10

   British actor died Tuesday at age 89

   Maverick (1960-61)
   Roger Moore was born in the U.K. but got his start as an MGM contract
   player in the 1950s. His first big breaks came in television, including
   this Western starring James Garner as a frontier cardsharp.
   3 of 10

   British actor died Tuesday at age 89

   The Saint (1962-69)
   Moore became a household name as the star of this hit small-screen spy
   thriller, which was based on Leslie Charteris' books about the
   character Simon Templar. He brought a quippy charm to the role that he
   later applied to the Bond series.
   5 of 10

   British actor died Tuesday at age 89

   The Man Who Haunted Himself (1970)
   In this twisty pre-Bond thriller, Moore plays a man who gets into a car
   accident and discovers that he either has a doppelganger who is
   behaving very differently than he would -- or that he has gone insane.
   6 of 10

   British actor died Tuesday at age 89

   ffolkes (1980)
   Moore tried to shake off his James Bond persona with this thriller
   (which was originally titled "North Sea Hijack"), playing a
   misogyinistic freelance terrorism consultant who leads a team to combat
   terrorists seeking to blow up two oil rigs.
   7 of 10

   British actor died Tuesday at age 89

   The Cannonball Run (1981)
   Moore sent himself up in this caper comedy starring Burt Reynolds,
   playing a millionaire who has plastic surgery to better resemble ...
   Roger Moore.
   9 of 10

   British actor died Tuesday at age 89

   Spice World (1997)
   Moore plays the eccentric "Chief" of a record label in the musical
   comedy starring the British pop quintet the Spice Girls.
   10 of 10

   British actor died Tuesday at age 89

   Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore (2010)
   In this family comedy that spoofed Bond thrillers, Moore voiced the
   head of the feline spy agency MEOWS (Mousers Enforcing Our World's
   Safety) whose name, naturally, is Tab Lazenby.

Emmys: Here’s What Peter Dinklage Said When He Got Bleeped

   "Game of Throne's" Tyrion won Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama
   Series
   Beatrice Verhoeven | September 22, 2019 @ 7:20 PM

   “Game of Thrones” actor Peter Dinklage was bleeped on stage during his
   acceptance speech after he won Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama
   Series on Sunday — and here’s what he said.

   “Ten years of absolute sweat, but 10 years of the most talented,
   motherf—ing people…,” he told the audience. “Hey, it’s over, I don’t
   care.”

   Dinklage was nominated along with Jonathan Banks (“Better Call Saul”),
   Giancarlo Esposito (“Better Call Saul”), Alfie Allen (“Game of
   Thrones”), Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (“Game of Thrones”), Michael Kelly
   (“House of Cards”) and Chris Sullivan (“This Is Us”). This is his
   fourth Emmy for his role of Tyrion Lannister.

   Standing Ovation

   Although Lena Headey, Sophie Turner, Gwendoline Christie and Maisie
   Williams were nominated in the Outstanding Supporting Actress in a
   Drama Series category, the award ultimately went to Julia Garner
   (“Ozark”).

   Dinklage played the brother of Cersei and Jaime Lannister on “Game of
   Thrones” since Season 1. The show also starred Kit Harington, Emilia
   Clarke, Isaac Hempstead, Nathalie Emmanuel, Iain Glen, Carice van
   Houten, John Bradley and many more.

   Harington was nominated in the Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series
   category, but “Pose’s” Billy Porter took home the prize. Bob Odenkirk,
   Jason Bateman, Sterling K. Brown and Milo Ventimiglia were also
   nominated.

10 Notable Emmy Hosting Teams: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (Photos)

   1 of 14

   From Lucy and Desi to those reality-show hosts, the Emmys have both
   soared and stumbled when enlisting more than one host

   Because they co-host the “Weekend Update” segment on “Saturday Night
   Live,” it makes perfect sense for Colin Jost and Michael Che to host
   the 70th Primetime Emmy Awards together on Sept. 17. But over the last
   20 years, this will be only the third time the Emmys have used more
   than one host, even though two or more hosts were the norm in the
   show’s first half-century. Here are 10 other notable hosting teams,
   some that make perfect sense and some that don’t.
   2 of 14

   From Lucy and Desi to those reality-show hosts, the Emmys have both
   soared and stumbled when enlisting more than one host

   1952: Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz

   Lucy and Desi were clearly the first couple of television in its early
   days, so it was natural that they’d be co-hosts only the fourth time
   the Emmys were handed out – a show on which their show “I Love Lucy”
   also won the top comedy award.
   3 of 14

   From Lucy and Desi to those reality-show hosts, the Emmys have both
   soared and stumbled when enlisting more than one host

   1962: David Brinkley, Johnny Carson and Bob Newhart

   Why three hosts? Because the 1962 show took place simultaneously in
   three locations: Los Angeles (Newhart), New York (Carson) and
   Washington, D.C. (Brinkley).
   5 of 14

   From Lucy and Desi to those reality-show hosts, the Emmys have both
   soared and stumbled when enlisting more than one host

   1968: Frank Sinatra and Dick Van Dyke

   Sinatra handled the L.A. show, Van Dyke the N.Y. one, and they had one
   thing in common in 1968: They both barely survived a snafu-ridden Emmys
   show.
   6 of 14

   From Lucy and Desi to those reality-show hosts, the Emmys have both
   soared and stumbled when enlisting more than one host

   1976: Mary Tyler Moore and John Denver

   Mary Tyler Moore had been a TV icon for more than a decade, and the
   night she hosted in 1976 her show would win five top awards. So why
   saddle her with a country-pop singer who was criticized for saying “far
   out!” too much? Only the TV Academy knows.
   7 of 14

   From Lucy and Desi to those reality-show hosts, the Emmys have both
   soared and stumbled when enlisting more than one host

   1980: Steve Allen and Dick Clark

   Allen famously hated rock ‘n’ roll; Clark popularized it on “American
   Bandstand.” But they were both TV icons, so that was good enough.
   9 of 14

   From Lucy and Desi to those reality-show hosts, the Emmys have both
   soared and stumbled when enlisting more than one host

   1983: Eddie Murphy and Joan Rivers

   By the standards of the time, “Saturday Night Live” cast member Murphy
   and “Tonight Show” regular Rivers were pretty rude and transgressive
   comics – and they didn’t disappoint on Emmy night, delivering the
   bawdiest (and, some thought, most offensive) Emmys ever.
   10 of 14

   From Lucy and Desi to those reality-show hosts, the Emmys have both
   soared and stumbled when enlisting more than one host

   1986: Shelley Long and David Letterman

   Letterman was only in his third year as a late-night host, while Long
   was already on her fourth nomination for her role in “Cheers.” But the
   show was on NBC and they were two of the network’s biggest stars, so
   they became co-hosts.
   11 of 14

   From Lucy and Desi to those reality-show hosts, the Emmys have both
   soared and stumbled when enlisting more than one host

   1990: Candice Bergen, Jay Leno and Jane Pauley

   Bergen played a Pauley-like newswoman on “Murphy Brown,” and Leno was
   the change of pace in the middle of a three-hour show in which each of
   the hosts handled duties for an hour.
   13 of 14

   From Lucy and Desi to those reality-show hosts, the Emmys have both
   soared and stumbled when enlisting more than one host

   1995: Jason Alexander and Cybill Shepherd

   Alexander was in the sixth year of the comedy series “Seinfeld,”
   Shepherd in the first year of her series “Cybill.” One of those shows
   would go on to be iconic, and the other wouldn't.
   14 of 14

   From Lucy and Desi to those reality-show hosts, the Emmys have both
   soared and stumbled when enlisting more than one host

   2008: Tom Bergeron, Heidi Klum, Howie Mandel, Jeff Probst and Ryan
   Seacrest

   “It sounded like a good idea,” Probst told TheWrap of the ill-fated
   plan to put the five nominees in the reality-host category in charge of
   the Emmys. “[We] were supposed to be the best hosts, and yet we did the
   worst hosting in the history of the Emmys.”
