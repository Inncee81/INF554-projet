TRAVELLING TO A HOME GAME

   The Liverpool FC Women home ground is Prenton Park, Wirral (Tranmere
   Rovers FC)

   Sat Nav postcode: CH42 9PY

   There is a large car park at the ground which is free on LFC Women
   matchdays.

   Please be aware you may have to pay a toll depending on your route to
   the ground:

   The Mersey Gateway Bridge - the bridge operates a free flow tolling
   system. This means there are no toll booths on the bridge so traffic
   can move quickly across the route. Cameras and sensors read vehicle
   number plates and special Merseyflow stickers to charge drivers. Anyone
   who crosses the bridge and doesn’t pay by 11.59pm the day after will
   receive a penalty charge notice. For more details including toll
   charges and to pay a toll click here.

   Mersey Tunnel - payments are in cash at the tolling booths. For more
   details including toll charges please click here.

   our guide for everything you need to know about attending a home game.

   The Liverpool FC Women home ground is Prenton Park, Wirral (Tranmere
   Rovers FC).

   There is a large car park at the ground which is free on LFC Women
   matchdays.

   Match day experience:

   Seating at the stadium is unreserved so you can sit together with

   staff, news, player profiles, team stats and puzzles for kids.

   Refreshments can be purchased from the concourse area at the stadium.

   chocolate, sweets and pies.

   A selection of official LFC Women merchandise is available to buy
   within the stadium including home shirts, LFC Women scarves, player
   cards and more.

   Official club mascot Mighty Red attends all LFC Women home games,
   meeting and greeting supporters ahead of kick-off and providing half
   time entertainment, inviting a lucky fan onto the pitch to take part in
   a penalty shoot-out game and the opportunity to win exclusive prizes.

   If you need help on the day, ask any of the stewards located around the
   ground who will be happy to help!

TRAVELLING TO A HOME GAME

   The Liverpool FC Women home ground is Prenton Park, Wirral (Tranmere
   Rovers FC)

   Sat Nav postcode: CH42 9PY

   There is a large car park at the ground which is free on LFC Women
   matchdays.

   Please be aware you may have to pay a toll depending on your route to
   the ground:

   The Mersey Gateway Bridge - the bridge operates a free flow tolling
   system. This means there are no toll booths on the bridge so traffic
   can move quickly across the route. Cameras and sensors read vehicle
   number plates and special Merseyflow stickers to charge drivers. Anyone
   who crosses the bridge and doesn’t pay by 11.59pm the day after will
   receive a penalty charge notice. For more details including toll
   charges and to pay a toll click here.

   Mersey Tunnel - payments are in cash at the tolling booths. For more
   details including toll charges please click here.

   within the stadium including home shirts, LFC Women scarves, player
   cards and more.

   Official club mascot Mighty Red attends all LFC Women home games,
   meeting and greeting supporters ahead of kick-off and providing half
   time entertainment, inviting a lucky fan onto the pitch to take part in
   a penalty shoot-out game and the opportunity to win exclusive prizes.

   If you need help on the day, ask any of the stewards located around the
   ground who will be happy to help!
