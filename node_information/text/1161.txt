Trump’s Cold War with China Could Literally Break the Internet

Worsening tensions could push China to split from Silicon Valley, raising the
specter of a completely bifurcated digital world.

   The tech cold war between the United States and China is continuing to
   escalate. Just days after the Trump administration blacklisted China’s
   largest tech firm, Huawei, it’s reportedly weighing a ban against
   additional Chinese companies as part of its broader standoff with
   Beijing, cutting off their access to American technology. The move is
   likely to inflame tensions, and could accelerate the division between
   companies that rely on American tech, and those that use Chinese,
   potentially setting Beijing on a path to technological independence.
   “Even the briefest of bans will be proof to them that China can no
   longer rely on outsiders,” Bloomberg’s Tim Culpan wrote Sunday. “This
   can only accelerate the process of creating a digital iron curtain that
   separates the world into two distinct, mutually exclusive technological
   spheres.”

   The standoff has been brewing for months as Donald Trump battles
   Chinese President Xi Jinping over a relationship the president says has
   “taken so advantage” of the U.S., but it boiled over last week when the
   administration blacklisted Huawei, accusing the Chinese tech giant of
   being “involved in activities contrary to the national security or
   foreign policy interests of the United States”—namely, helping the
   Chinese government engage in foreign espionage. Major western tech
   companies including Google and chipmakers like Intel and Qualcomm have
   cut off supply to Huawei. Still, China has stood firm. On Monday,
   Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei said the administration “underestimates”
   China’s strength and welcomed the fight as step toward global tech
   domination. “We have sacrificed ourselves and our families for our
   ideal: to stand on top of the world,” Ren told Chinese media. “To reach
   this ideal, sooner or later there will be conflict with the U.S.”

   That conflict has already hurt Huawei, and could bring some pain to
   American companies that do business with the world’s second-largest
   economy, as the Associated Press noted Tuesday. But in the longer term,
   it could spur China to greater independence from the U.S., raising the
   specter of the bifurcated internet that Eric Schmidt—the former C.E.O.
   of Google’s parent company, Alphabet—and others have predicted. “I
   think the most likely scenario now is not a splintering,” Schmidt said
   last year, “but rather a bifurcation into a Chinese-led internet and a
   non-Chinese internet led by America.” China has already set 2025 as its
   target for technological independence. If it no longer sees the U.S. as
   a reliable partner, it is ever more likely to begin a push to
   manufacture all its products domestically. Such bifurcation could
   change the tech sphere as we know it, creating not only different
   digital universes for different populations (a censored Web in
   authoritarian China, and a free Web everywhere else), but different
   megalithic hardware companies, depending on the region.

   Tensions are already high between the countries over the Huawei
   dispute, but they’re likely to grow as the U.S. considers adding to the
   blacklist. Hikvision, the world’s largest manufacturer of video
   surveillance equipment and one of the companies that could fall under
   the axe, has faced bipartisan scrutiny in the U.S. over its role in the
   Chinese government’s use of artificial intelligence to track and
   control its minority Muslim population. But the move has drawn
   condemnation from Beijing, which is accusing the administration of
   “arbitrarily” hitting at Chinese industry to gain an upper hand in its
   trade war. “China opposes the United States’s practice of abusing state
   power and arbitrarily discrediting and suppressing foreign enterprises,
   including Chinese enterprises, Lu Kang, a spokesperson for the Chinese
   foreign ministry, said in a briefing Wednesday.

Jake Gyllenhaal Is Big on Exfoliation and Gary Shteyngart–Style Narcissism

The actor, now on Broadway in the two-man show Sea Wall/A Life, reprises his
role as the face of Calvin Klein Eternity for this month’s new eau de parfum.
Not that he needs it. “I do believe in showering as a spiritual practice and
a physical practice.”


    Laura Regensdorf

   September 9, 2019 8:00 AM
   By Taylor Jewell/Invision/AP/Shutterstock.

   Jake Gyllenhaal thinks I’m hot. He said as much one afternoon this
   summer, while we were sitting at a two-top on the back patio of Lucali,
   the Brooklyn pizza joint with the perpetual mile-long wait list. (He’s
   a regular. The owner, Mark Iacono, had opened up early and was already
   churning out pies.) Or rather, the actor’s actual words were, “You
   might want to use that.” He was holding out a paper napkin with one
   hand, as the other pantomimed a fanning gesture. A pearlescent sweat
   mustache dotted my upper lip, and Gyllenhaal had apparently taken
   notice. Of my hotness.

   I peeled off my blazer, casting aside a flush of embarrassment. It was
   summer in the city, and a wood-fired oven was blazing inside. Besides,
   isn’t that what a perceptive actor is supposed to take in: the subtle
   discomfort of his wilting tablemate?

   In a way, that is what Gyllenhaal has been doing every night at the
   Hudson Theatre since the two-man Broadway show, Sea Wall/A Life, began
   previews in late July. It’s a diptych of grief stories: a gut punch of
   a monologue delivered by Tom Sturridge, followed by an antic solo turn
   by Gyllenhaal, who plays a thirty-something toggling between losing a
   dad and welcoming a son. (“I read somewhere that to be born is to risk
   death,” his character says, the weight of fatherhood looming.) But even
   on an empty stage, Gyllenhaal is hardly alone. “I have never done a
   show where I speak to the audience the entire time,” he says,
   describing an unusual cocoon of intimacy in the thousand-seat venue
   (four times what the production first counted when it ran Off-Broadway
   this past spring). “We don’t have any rules in our show. Whatever
   happens, happens.”

   Like what? “A phone goes off. A lot of actors would be
   like”—Gyllenhaal’s voice slides into mock effrontery—“ ‘How dare you
   destroy the sanctity of the sacred space of theater.’ “ He credits the
   director Carrie Cracknell with holding the two men to task. “Every time
   it felt like we were performing, she’d call us on bullshit, and so in
   that sense, the idea that we’re separate from the audience also feels
   like bullshit. If something happens that’s human—particularly when
   we’re talking about the mess of being human—it makes no sense to try
   and pretend like it doesn’t exist.” That’s why he comically apologizes,
   mid-play, as he wiggles past the front row. I wonder if he’s ever
   extended a tissue to a crying theatergoer. Or a perspiring one.

   But what brought us to Lucali (besides the promise of a good slice) was
   a different kind of role: Gyllenhaal as the face of Calvin Klein
   Eternity. In 2017 he played the family man in a Cary Fukunaga-directed
   commercial, opposite Liya Kebede and their fictional child. (The
   internet gushed about Gyllenhaal’s “hot dad” moment, but in reality
   heʼs the hot uncle to his sister Maggieʼs kids.) Now, Gyllenhaal is
   fronting a more intense eau de parfum version. Is it a bit like when a
   well-received show transfers to Broadway? “I’m totally willing to make
   that connection,” he said with a laugh—and totally willing to talk
   about cinematic scents, fictional narcissism, and his own preferred way
   to sweat.

   Vanity Fair: Fatherhood is a recurring theme, in the play and in that
   original Eternity campaign. Has your family been laying on the
   pressure?

   Jake Gyllenhaal: My dad in particular just was fascinated with the
   choice [of] being a father in an ad. He was like, “So what is this all
   about?” When the Calvin Klein team brought it up to me, what felt a lot
   more interesting was the idea of family, outside of selling a fragrance
   with sex. It was obviously the implication of sex because there was a
   child, but the child was a product of love. A lot of the roles I do are
   me asking myself questions, and I can’t separate—whether it be an
   advertisement or a movie—being honest from any of those things. And I
   love my nieces, I love sort of the idea of having my own child, so I
   wanted to explore that. I’m doing a show on Broadway that’s about being
   a son, being a father, and I think I’m at a place in my life where my
   parents are at a certain age and our positions start to change. My
   parents have made movies themselves, and my mom in particular was
   always asking questions about family and exploring that idea.

   I’m just in the middle of Sheila Heti’s Motherhood, and the book deals
   with the idea of being an artist or a mother, and whether one
   sublimates the other.

   Well, I watch someone like Stephen Sondheim, who I would say is the
   preeminent poet-lyricist of our time, particularly in musical
   theater—and he’s birthed child after child with his creations. I did
   one of his shows [Sunday in the Park with George], and the first act is
   about an artist’s being obsessed with their work and not being able to
   commit to their life. And then in the second act—this is my
   interpretation—is an artist who was well renowned, made a lot of money,
   but wasn’t, as my high school art history teacher said, a
   "meta-historical artist" that transcends decades and generations. And
   yet he discovers at the end of that show that making a family is his
   triumph. The only things we leave behind are children and art, and that
   is the never-ending question.

   Given the themes of Sea Wall/A Life, is there a lingering heaviness
   that you need to, say, exorcise in the bathtub at night?

   No. I’m a real wonderful mess, you know? I’ve learned to accept a lot
   about myself. I’ve put myself through a lot of weird physical things
   for roles I’ve done, emotional things for roles I’ve done. The other
   day Carrie [Cracknell, the director] was like, "Both of you looked
   wrecked at the end of that [Off-Broadway] run." And it’s interesting
   because I’ve never laughed so much in my life. Yet the energy you’re
   exchanging does take it from you. I do believe in showering as a
   spiritual practice and a physical practice. Since working in South
   Korea on a movie, I’ve found exfoliation to be a really wonderful, very
   manly thing, which I didn’t appreciate as much before.

   Clearly you’re invested in taking care of yourself. Are there things
   you do for wellness, and then things you call bullshit on?

   I think it’s all bullshit if you want it to be bullshit, and it’s not
   if you don’t. I feel that way about pretty much everything as long as
   you’re not hurting anyone. I believe in sweat, in whatever form. For
   me, my best form of self-care is intimacy; that makes me sweat. And
   then I believe in the balance of rest and exercise. It’s really that
   simple for me. Because I have an older sister who is an actor—and
   because she has taught me since I was a kid and I’ve looked up to
   her—skin care is important. People can definitely get me for that, but
   you’d be laughing your way to wherever. I think caring for yourself is
   really important, particularly nowadays as men. Being vulnerable and
   admitting those vulnerabilities is very, very important.

   Some actors use scent to help get into character. Have you ever done
   that, whether with forest-y scents or unshowered stink?

   I’ve used and tried it all. Nothing works. In the end, it’s all about
   good writing.

   On the flip side, John Waters gave the audience scratch-and-sniff
   Odorama cards for Polyester. If you could imagine a film of yours that
   deserves a scratch-and-sniff card, what would it be?

   I’m thinking of Zeffirelli’s Romeo and Juliet—what that
   scratch-and-sniff card would smell like, because if it smells the way
   that movie looks, my god. And Nightcrawler—new leather car smells. It
   has top notes of blood and fecal matter.

   John Waters would definitely approve.

   Yes, he would!

   Tell me about the upcoming adaptation of Gary Shteyngartʼs Lake
   Success. It seems like slipping into a character that narcissistic is
   perhaps less appealing than the father role for Eternity?

   I do want to try that on. In fact, I live in it all the time—we
   subscribe to it daily and hourly, minute by minute. I’m really
   fascinated to explore someone who is a narcissist and who is obsessed
   with capitalism and all the trappings around it. Is it possible to pull
   someone from that, into their humanness? Are we too far gone? Gary’s
   writing—that you love him and understand something about him even as
   you are disgusted—I just think that’s so human. We live in a world
   where there are a lot of black-and-whites, and the spectrum really
   doesn’t exist in many other spaces.

   You joined Instagram recently, and itʼs a similarly sanitized space.
   You don’t see a lot of the uncomfortable.

   I totally agree. In my world, there are a lot of people tailoring
   themselves and altering the beautiful parts of their personalities to
   show people something that is probably not fully true. I’ve done it for
   many years in different ways, and I think my desire to be a part of
   something like Instagram is just to say, "I am a part of everything
   with everyone." I don’t want to isolate myself in some idea of what an
   artist is supposed to be. If I’m interested in the unknown in my work,
   Instagram is an unknown to me. Why would I avoid it? And I’m
   discovering some interesting things! I say that with a wink. Curiosity
   is everything, and if we lose it, we’re fucked.

   Jake Gyllenhaal thinks I’m hot. He said as much one afternoon this
   summer, while we were sitting at a two-top on the back patio of Lucali,

Star Wars: The Truth About Kylo Ren and Rey’s Connection

   Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver discuss the intergalactic will they/won’t
   they.

   For a certain segment of the Star Wars fandom, the juiciest nugget from
   Vanity Fair’s exclusive new cover story on The Rise of Skywalker has to
   be this: “a source close to the movie says that [Kylo Ren and Rey’s]
   Force-connection will turn out to run even deeper than we thought.” For
   lack of any more obvious Anakin and Padmé or Han and Leia-type romances
   in the trilogy, fans have latched on to Kylo and Rey as potential
   star-crossed lovers ripped apart by opposite sides of the Force. But do
   actors Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver see them that way? Vanity Fair
   contributor Lev Grossman attempted to find out.

   Unlike some potential romances that have preoccupied fans, the Kylo and
   Rey relationship has gotten plenty of support from inside the Star Wars
   production team. When speaking about The Force Awakens, director J.J.
   Abrams referred to Star Wars as “a fairy tale” calling out both Kylo as
   a “prince” and the duo’s “interesting relationship moving forward.”
   Mark Hamill referred to the pair’s “romantic tension” in The Last Jedi.
   But things looked decisively done between the two at the end of Episode
   VIII. And, at any rate, Rey has a lot more on her mind—like saving the
   galaxy. So where do they go from here?

   When speaking about their characters with Grossman, both Ridley and
   Driver wound up describing similarly lonely and isolated childhoods for
   these Force-sensitive figures. Rey was literally abandoned by her
   parents—whoever they may be—and so has trouble comprehending how Kylo
   could shun his. But Ridley herself is much more understanding of the
   stress that might come from being raised by Han Solo and Leia Organa:
   “Having the two coolest parents and sometimes I’m sure it works
   amazingly, and sometimes it just might not.”

   For Driver, this concept is the key to understanding Kylo Ren. “If you
   were the product of those two people, two very strong personalities who
   seemed to be almost more committed to a cause than anything else,
   what’s that like?” he says. Ben Solo is born to privilege, yes, but
   also tremendous pressure. Driver likens the Skywalker–Solos to a royal
   family, and notes the isolating power of being born with those
   spectacular gifts: “How do you form friendships out of that? How do you
   understand the weight of that? . . . It can easily go awry.” Burdened
   by her own talents, Rey also feels that solitude. “It’s a bit lonely
   having that much on one’s shoulders,” Ridley says.

   Though their shared childhood isolation set them on two very different
   paths, the Rian Johnson-directed Last Jedi showed Kylo and Rey finding
   kinship in each other. Ridley describes them as “two quite powerful
   people who feel.” Driver adds that his character “had been forging this
   maybe-bond with Rey. The Last Jedi ends with the question in the air:
   is he going to pursue that relationship more or, when the door of her
   ship goes up, does that also close that camaraderie? This idea of being
   alone.”

   If Kylo is still questioning, Rey is, at least initially, more
   resolute. Ridley says that as The Rise of Skywalker begins, “Rey is
   less inclined to believe that Kylo potentially could redeem himself.”

   Looking back over the long arc of nine films, it’s easy to see the
   Skywalker saga as not only a story about repairing fractured bonds and
   escaping repeated patterns of a specific bloodline, but also the
   families we create for ourselves. John Boyega’s Finn and Oscar Isaac’s
   Poe Dameron are both options of support for Rey as she tries to build
   something new out of the ashes of her first attempt to reach Kylo Ren.
   “It’s not about just one person,” Isaac says of how his character deals
   with the strain of leadership and heroism in The Rise of Skywalker.
   “[It’s about] reaching out to his family, and particularly Finn is his
   family.”

   Ridley says Rey is also part of that relationship, but kept apart a bit
   due to her Force sensitivity. Will Kylo Ren and Rey reforge their own
   connection? And, if they do, will it be love or simply friendship that
   unites them? The answer, Driver says, is incredibly complicated: “I
   don’t think it’s any one thing. The strength in what Rian [Johnson]
   wrote and what J.J. [Abrams] wrote is it’s never all one thing.”

Star Wars: The Truth About Kylo Ren and Rey’s Connection

Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver discuss the intergalactic will they/won’t they.

   “maybe-bond”—will turn out to run even deeper than previously revealed.

   For a certain segment of the Star Wars fandom, the juiciest nugget from
   Vanity Fair’s exclusive new cover story on The Rise of Skywalker has to
   be this: “a source close to the movie says that [Kylo Ren and Rey’s]
   Force-connection will turn out to run even deeper than we thought.” For
   lack of any more obvious Anakin and Padmé or Han and Leia-type romances
   in the trilogy, fans have latched on to Kylo and Rey as potential
   star-crossed lovers ripped apart by opposite sides of the Force. But do
   actors Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver see them that way? Vanity Fair
   contributor Lev Grossman attempted to find out.

   Unlike some potential romances that have preoccupied fans, the Kylo and
   Rey relationship has gotten plenty of support from inside the Star Wars
   production team. When speaking about The Force Awakens, director J.J.
   Abrams referred to Star Wars as “a fairy tale” calling out both Kylo as
   a “prince” and the duo’s “interesting relationship moving forward.”
   Mark Hamill referred to the pair’s “romantic tension” in The Last Jedi.
   But things looked decisively done between the two at the end of Episode
   VIII. And, at any rate, Rey has a lot more on her mind—like saving the
   galaxy. So where do they go from here?

   When speaking about their characters with Grossman, both Ridley and
   Driver wound up describing similarly lonely and isolated childhoods for
   these Force-sensitive figures. Rey was literally abandoned by her
   parents—whoever they may be—and so has trouble comprehending how Kylo
   could shun his. But Ridley herself is much more understanding of the
   stress that might come from being raised by Han Solo and Leia Organa:
   “Having the two coolest parents and sometimes I’m sure it works
   amazingly, and sometimes it just might not.”

   For Driver, this concept is the key to understanding Kylo Ren. “If you
   were the product of those two people, two very strong personalities who
   seemed to be almost more committed to a cause than anything else,
   what’s that like?” he says. Ben Solo is born to privilege, yes, but
   also tremendous pressure. Driver likens the Skywalker–Solos to a royal
   family, and notes the isolating power of being born with those
   spectacular gifts: “How do you form friendships out of that? How do you
   understand the weight of that? . . . It can easily go awry.” Burdened
   by her own talents, Rey also feels that solitude. “It’s a bit lonely
   having that much on one’s shoulders,” Ridley says.

   Though their shared childhood isolation set them on two very different
   paths, the Rian Johnson-directed Last Jedi showed Kylo and Rey finding
   kinship in each other. Ridley describes them as “two quite powerful
   people who feel.” Driver adds that his character “had been forging this
   maybe-bond with Rey. The Last Jedi ends with the question in the air:
   is he going to pursue that relationship more or, when the door of her
   ship goes up, does that also close that camaraderie? This idea of being
   alone.”

   If Kylo is still questioning, Rey is, at least initially, more
   resolute. Ridley says that as The Rise of Skywalker begins, “Rey is
   less inclined to believe that Kylo potentially could redeem himself.”

   Looking back over the long arc of nine films, it’s easy to see the
   Skywalker saga as not only a story about repairing fractured bonds and
   escaping repeated patterns of a specific bloodline, but also the
   families we create for ourselves. John Boyega’s Finn and Oscar Isaac’s
   Poe Dameron are both options of support for Rey as she tries to build
   something new out of the ashes of her first attempt to reach Kylo Ren.
   “It’s not about just one person,” Isaac says of how his character deals
   with the strain of leadership and heroism in The Rise of Skywalker.
   “[It’s about] reaching out to his family, and particularly Finn is his
   family.”

   Ridley says Rey is also part of that relationship, but kept apart a bit
   due to her Force sensitivity. Will Kylo Ren and Rey reforge their own
   connection? And, if they do, will it be love or simply friendship that
   unites them? The answer, Driver says, is incredibly complicated: “I
   don’t think it’s any one thing. The strength in what Rian [Johnson]
   wrote and what J.J. [Abrams] wrote is it’s never all one thing.”
