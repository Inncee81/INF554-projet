Il centro di New York

Scoprite il cuore di New York

   Benvenuti nel celebre Empire State Building. Situati nel cuore di
   Midtown Manhattan, gli osservatori dell'86° e del 102° piano regalano
   un'indimenticabile vista a 360° di New York e dintorni. Che siate in
   città per un giorno o per una settimana, nessuna visita di New York può
   dirsi completa senza un giro in cima all'Empire State Building.

   Read a review about going first thing and I can definitely recommend
   that. The exhibition floors are amazing and the kids could explore with
   space and enjoy everything without queuing. This attraction is a must
   if you want to take on the sights of New York.

   If You Haven’t Been in a While, Go Again!

   Last time I was at the Empire State Building was probably 15 years ago.
   This time, it felt completely different. The Museum portion in the
   lower floors was outstanding, outlining the history and construction of
   the building with lots of colorful and interactive displays. I don’t
   think we ran into even a single staff member who was anything less than
   pleasant. What can I say about the view? Absolutely amazing in every
   direction. Lots of places to get a close up view of specific sights and
   overall, just breathtaking. This is 100% a must-do in NYC and it can
   make you forget all of the craziness of the world below you.

Das Zentrum von New York

Entdecken Sie das Herz New Yorks

   Herzlich willkommen im weltberühmten Empire State Building. Das Empire
   State Building liegt im Zentrum von Midtown Manhattan, und unsere
   Aussichtsplattformen auf der 86. und 102. Etage bieten einen
   unvergesslichen Rundumblick auf New York City und die weitere Umgebung.
   Ganz gleich, ob Sie für eine Woche oder nur für einen Tag in der Stadt
   sind – ein Besuch in NYC ist erst dann vollkommen, wenn Sie auf der
   Spitze des Empire State Building gewesen sind.

   Magnificent Experience
   Magnificent Experience

   Just perfect and it definitely lives up to the hype. Wonderful views, a
   great atmosphere, and just a real pleasure to be up there, experiencing
   it all. A must-see.

   Read a review about going first thing and I can definitely recommend
   that. The exhibition floors are amazing and the kids could explore with
   space and enjoy everything without queuing. This attraction is a must
   if you want to take on the sights of New York.

   If You Haven’t Been in a While, Go Again!

   Last time I was at the Empire State Building was probably 15 years ago.
   This time, it felt completely different. The Museum portion in the
   lower floors was outstanding, outlining the history and construction of
   the building with lots of colorful and interactive displays. I don’t
   think we ran into even a single staff member who was anything less than
   pleasant. What can I say about the view? Absolutely amazing in every
   direction. Lots of places to get a close up view of specific sights and
   overall, just breathtaking. This is 100% a must-do in NYC and it can
   make you forget all of the craziness of the world below you.

   Not Just a Great View!

   5 of us visited and 5 of us came away absolutely thrilled! Whilst the
   views are obviously amazing, you will also enjoy the sizeable effort
   put into making the museum portion of the experience interesting and
   easy to take in. I would totally recommend this experience to anyone
   visiting New York.TIP: Visit at nighttime for MUCH shorter queues and
   see the colourful lights of New York.
