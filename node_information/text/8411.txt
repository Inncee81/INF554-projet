   Reports from the frontlines of the Trump administration's "Remain in

   border in Mexico, in a makeshift refugee camp,  and from the officers
   who sent them there to wait in the first place.

   “When I’m trying to explain our program  to someone who doesn’t know
   it, I stammer a bunch of words like ‘entertaining,’ ‘funny,’
   ‘surprising plot twists,’ ‘true stories but not boring I swear’ … and
   then I just give them this list.” — Ira Glass
