   Conducteur spl (Current Employee) –  Gard – March 10, 2019
   Expérience intéressante mais vie de famille difficilement associable.
   Même pour moi qui aime bouger dans ma vie professionnel je me lasse
   maintenant et j'aimerai un travail un peu plus stable même si bouger
   quelque jours par semaine ne me dérangerai pas.
   Pros
   Congés payés.
   Cons
   Trop souvent absent de chez soit.

   Cook (Former Employee) –  McDonough, GA – July 29, 2019
   They won't pay you near what you're worth . They pay you under the
   table and still try to get over. The owner tried to underpay me on
   purpose. There not worth working for.

   I would recommend this job to anyone in high school trying to get some

   Good place to work
   Waiter/Bartender (Former Employee) –  Caguas, PR – December 11, 2017
   It's a family environment and good place for events such as birthdays,
   anniversaries and any kind of celebration. At night a lot of people go
   to drink and they tip really well. I learned to work under pressure
   with the big parties and when it was happy hour time. The hardest part
   of the job is to serve multiple customers and charge them. I learned
   how to use the cash register. The most enjoyable part of the job was to
   engage customers and make them feel comfortable in the restaurant.
   Pros
   Employee discount
   Cons
   During the day there is not as much visitors as at night time

   Fun but too much drama
   Waitress/Cashier (Former Employee) –  Lone Oak, TX – August 9, 2017
   I cannot handle the drama and could not deal with the owners sisters.
   Food is always good although the banana pudding is not homemade as well
   as the peach cobbler.
   Staff is friendly yet its a job for them till they find something else
   better.

   Overall great place to work
   Waitress and Cashier (Current Employee) –  Lone Oak, Teas – June 11,
   2013
   The owner and manager are absolutely great. They work very well with
   your schedule. I've learned how to put other peoples needs before mine.
   My co-workers are fantastic. We all work very well as a team.
