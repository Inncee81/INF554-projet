   BMJ Open is an online, open access journal, dedicated to publishing
   medical research from all disciplines and therapeutic areas.

   The journal publishes all research study types, from protocols through
   phase I trials to meta-analyses, including small, specialist studies,
   and negative studies. Publishing procedures are built around fully open
   peer review and continuous publication, publishing research online as
   soon as the article is ready.

   BMJ Open aims to promote transparency in the publication process by
   publishing reviewer reports and previous versions of manuscripts as
   pre-publication histories. Authors are asked to pay article-publishing
   charges on acceptance; the ability to pay does not influence editorial
   decisions.

   All papers are included in MEDLINE/PubMed and Science Citation Index
   Expanded (Web of Science).
