     Abstract: We report on the neutrino mass measurement result from the
     first four-week science run of the Karlsruhe Tritium Neutrino
     experiment KATRIN in spring 2019. Beta-decay electrons from a
     high-purity gaseous molecular tritium source are energy analyzed by
     a high-resolution MAC-E filter. A fit of the integrated electron
     spectrum over a narrow interval around the kinematic endpoint at
     18.57 keV gives an effective neutrino mass square value of
     $(-1.0^{+0.9}_{-1.1})$ eV$^2$. From this we derive an upper limit of
     1.1 eV (90$\%$ confidence level) on the absolute mass scale of
     neutrinos. This value coincides with the KATRIN sensitivity. It
     improves upon previous mass limits from kinematic measurements by
     almost a factor of two and provides model-independent input to
     cosmological studies of structure formation.

Title:Upper Bound of Neutrino Masses from Combined Cosmological Observations
and Particle Physics Experiments

   Authors:Arthur Loureiro, Andrei Cuceu, Filipe B. Abdalla, Bruno Moraes,
   Lorne Whiteway, Michael McLeod, Sreekumar T. Balan, Ofer Lahav,
   Aurélien Benoit-Lévy, Marc Manera, Richard P. Rollins, Henrique S.
   Xavier
   (Submitted on 6 Nov 2018 (v1), last revised 27 Aug 2019 (this version,
   v2))

     Abstract: We investigate the impact of prior models on the upper
     bound of the sum of neutrino masses, $\sum m_{\nu}$. We use data
     from Large Scale Structure of galaxies, Cosmic Microwave Background,
     Type Ia SuperNovae, and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. We probe
     physically motivated neutrino mass models (respecting oscillation
     experiment constraints) and compare them to constraints using
     standard cosmological approximations. The former give a consistent
     upper bound of $\sum m_{\nu} \lesssim 0.26$ eV ($95\%$ CI) and
     yields a strong competitive upper bound for the lightest neutrino
     mass species, $m_0^{\nu} < 0.086$ eV ($95\%$ CI). By contrast one of
     the approximations, which is somewhat inconsistent with oscillation
     experiments, yields an upper bound of $\sum m_{\nu} \lesssim 0.15$
     eV ($95\%$ CI), which differs substantially from the former upper
     bound. We, therefore, argue that cosmological neutrino mass and
     hierarchy determination should be pursued using physically motivated
     models since approximations might lead to incorrect and nonphysical
     upper bounds.

Title:On the Duffin-Schaeffer conjecture

   Authors:Dimitris Koukoulopoulos, James Maynard
   (Submitted on 10 Jul 2019)

     Abstract: Let $\psi:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{R}_{\ge0}$ be an arbitrary
     function from the positive integers to the non-negative reals.
     Consider the set $\mathcal{A}$ of real numbers $\alpha$ for which
     there are infinitely many reduced fractions $a/q$ such that
     $|\alpha-a/q|\le \psi(q)/q$. If $\sum_{q=1}^\infty
     \psi(q)\phi(q)/q=\infty$, we show that $\mathcal{A}$ has full
     Lebesgue measure. This answers a question of Duffin and Schaeffer.
     As a corollary, we also establish a conjecture due to Catlin
     regarding non-reduced solutions to the inequality $|\alpha - a/q|\le
     \psi(q)/q$, giving a refinement of Khinchin's Theorem.

General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology

Title:Quantum Transfiguration of Kruskal Black Holes

   Authors:Abhay Ashtekar, Javier Olmedo, Parampreet Singh
   (Submitted on 2 Jun 2018 (v1), last revised 9 Nov 2018 (this version,
   v2))

     Abstract: We present a new effective description of macroscopic
     Kruskal black holes that incorporates corrections due to quantum
     geometry effects of loop quantum gravity. It encompasses both the
     `interior' region that contains classical singularities and the
     `exterior' asymptotic region. Singularities are naturally resolved
     by the quantum geometry effects of loop quantum gravity, and the
     resulting quantum extension of the full Kruskal space-time is free
     of all the known limitations of previous investigations [1-11] of
     the Schwarzschild interior. We compare and contrast our results with
     these investigations and also with the expectations based on the
     AdS/CFT duality [12].

General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology

Title:Small black/white hole stability and dark matter

   Authors:Carlo Rovelli, Francesca Vidotto
   (Submitted on 10 May 2018 (v1), last revised 9 Nov 2018 (this version,
   v2))

     Abstract: We show that the expected lifetime of white holes formed
     as remnants of evaporated black holes is consistent with their
     production at reheating. We give a simple quantum description of
     these objects and argue that a quantum superposition of black and
     white holes with large interiors is stable, because it is protected
     by the existence of a minimal eigenvalue of the area, predicted by
     Loop Quantum Gravity. These two results support the hypothesis that
     a component of dark matter could be formed by small black hole
     remnants.

     Abstract: We report on the neutrino mass measurement result from the
     first four-week science run of the Karlsruhe Tritium Neutrino
     experiment KATRIN in spring 2019. Beta-decay electrons from a
     high-purity gaseous molecular tritium source are energy analyzed by
     a high-resolution MAC-E filter. A fit of the integrated electron
     spectrum over a narrow interval around the kinematic endpoint at
     18.57 keV gives an effective neutrino mass square value of
     $(-1.0^{+0.9}_{-1.1})$ eV$^2$. From this we derive an upper limit of
     1.1 eV (90$\%$ confidence level) on the absolute mass scale of
     neutrinos. This value coincides with the KATRIN sensitivity. It
     improves upon previous mass limits from kinematic measurements by
     almost a factor of two and provides model-independent input to
     cosmological studies of structure formation.

Title:Upper Bound of Neutrino Masses from Combined Cosmological Observations
and Particle Physics Experiments

   Authors:Arthur Loureiro, Andrei Cuceu, Filipe B. Abdalla, Bruno Moraes,

   (Submitted on 6 Nov 2018 (v1), last revised 27 Aug 2019 (this version,
   v2))

     Abstract: We investigate the impact of prior models on the upper
     bound of the sum of neutrino masses, $\sum m_{\nu}$. We use data
     from Large Scale Structure of galaxies, Cosmic Microwave Background,
     Type Ia SuperNovae, and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. We probe
     physically motivated neutrino mass models (respecting oscillation
     experiment constraints) and compare them to constraints using
     standard cosmological approximations. The former give a consistent
     upper bound of $\sum m_{\nu} \lesssim 0.26$ eV ($95\%$ CI) and
     yields a strong competitive upper bound for the lightest neutrino
     mass species, $m_0^{\nu} < 0.086$ eV ($95\%$ CI). By contrast one of
     the approximations, which is somewhat inconsistent with oscillation
     experiments, yields an upper bound of $\sum m_{\nu} \lesssim 0.15$
     eV ($95\%$ CI), which differs substantially from the former upper
     bound. We, therefore, argue that cosmological neutrino mass and
     hierarchy determination should be pursued using physically motivated
     models since approximations might lead to incorrect and nonphysical
     upper bounds.

Title:On the Duffin-Schaeffer conjecture

   Authors:Dimitris Koukoulopoulos, James Maynard
   (Submitted on 10 Jul 2019)

     Abstract: Let $\psi:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{R}_{\ge0}$ be an arbitrary
     function from the positive integers to the non-negative reals.
     Consider the set $\mathcal{A}$ of real numbers $\alpha$ for which
     there are infinitely many reduced fractions $a/q$ such that
     $|\alpha-a/q|\le \psi(q)/q$. If $\sum_{q=1}^\infty
     \psi(q)\phi(q)/q=\infty$, we show that $\mathcal{A}$ has full
     Lebesgue measure. This answers a question of Duffin and Schaeffer.
     As a corollary, we also establish a conjecture due to Catlin
     regarding non-reduced solutions to the inequality $|\alpha - a/q|\le
     \psi(q)/q$, giving a refinement of Khinchin's Theorem.

General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology

Title:Quantum Transfiguration of Kruskal Black Holes

   Authors:Abhay Ashtekar, Javier Olmedo, Parampreet Singh
   (Submitted on 2 Jun 2018 (v1), last revised 9 Nov 2018 (this version,
   v2))

     Abstract: We present a new effective description of macroscopic
     Kruskal black holes that incorporates corrections due to quantum
     geometry effects of loop quantum gravity. It encompasses both the
     `interior' region that contains classical singularities and the
     `exterior' asymptotic region. Singularities are naturally resolved
     by the quantum geometry effects of loop quantum gravity, and the
     resulting quantum extension of the full Kruskal space-time is free
     of all the known limitations of previous investigations [1-11] of
     the Schwarzschild interior. We compare and contrast our results with
     these investigations and also with the expectations based on the
     AdS/CFT duality [12].

General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology

Title:Small black/white hole stability and dark matter

   Authors:Carlo Rovelli, Francesca Vidotto
   (Submitted on 10 May 2018 (v1), last revised 9 Nov 2018 (this version,
   v2))

     Abstract: We show that the expected lifetime of white holes formed
     as remnants of evaporated black holes is consistent with their
     production at reheating. We give a simple quantum description of
     these objects and argue that a quantum superposition of black and
     white holes with large interiors is stable, because it is protected
     by the existence of a minimal eigenvalue of the area, predicted by
     Loop Quantum Gravity. These two results support the hypothesis that
     a component of dark matter could be formed by small black hole
     remnants.
