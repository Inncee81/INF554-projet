In response to:

   Shipping News from the August 10, 2006 issue

   To the Editors:

   Witold Rybczynski and the three writers he quotes in his article on
   container ships [“Shipping News,” NYR,August 10] omitted one crucial
   aspect of the shift to containers: how it has changed the life of
   seamen. Two years ago I made the crossing from France to New Jersey on
   a Polish container ship. Here are some points.

   Because the containers left no free deck space at all, the crewmen who
   were off duty spent their free time watching television in the salon.
   What they watched were porno CDs they bought in Rotterdam. The
   soundtrack was in Dutch and thus there were no stories to watch; they
   sat in front of the TV like cats watching moving images. They never saw
   the light of day; they didn’t look like sailors but like tired clerks
   when, gray-faced, they came to the mess to have their meal.

   Le Havre and Cherbourg were once favorite ports of call; some of their
   bars were famous. You could get your mail there, and meet up with the
   girls. Perhaps this wasn’t quite moral, but that was part of a sailor’s
   life. My Polish container ship docked in Le Havre not even for one
   night; in less than an hour the cargo for France was unloaded. In the
   meantime the bars, cafés, and dance halls were empty. Every so often a
   bunch of crewmen hired a taxi which brought a few girls to the ship;
   they awkwardly climbed the ladder in their high heels and were given
   twenty or at most thirty minutes to do their business. They looked
   miserable when they had to climb down again. Presumably the Dutch
   pornos served as well.

   I sat with the captain one evening and told him that I had always
   wanted to be a seaman (I am from Holland). He sneered, not at me but at
   the world. “Me too,” he said, “and I had my wish and I am sorry. The
   sea is now boring and it is dangerous. The worst of both worlds.”
   Malcom McLean never thought of that, I bet.

Active Vonnegut

   Norman Dorsen, reply by James Wolcott
   January 24, 1980 Issue

In response to:

   Mod Apostle from the November 22, 1979 issue

   To the Editors:

   James Wolcott’s engrossing view of Jailbird by Kurt Vonnegut (NYR,
   November 22) contains a passage that could be misconstrued. Wolcott
   refers to an article of Vonnegut’s that appeared in McCall’s soon after
   he witnessed the death spasms of the Republic of Biafra. Vonnegut
   responded to a neighbor who wanted to know what could be done by
   saying, “Nothing. It was and is an internal matter, which you can
   merely deplore.”

   Wolcott ignores the irony and writes, “Like Sacco and Vanzetti, the
   Biafran people are holy innocents, sacrificed on the altar of History,
   and all that Vonnegut asks is that we not avert our gaze.”

   While it is important not to avert our gaze, it is also important to
   act against injustice. I happen to know that Vonnegut is an active
   participant against injustice, at least those forms that attract the
   attention of the ACLU. Along with many other writers and artists,
   including Edward Asner, Jules Feiffer, Jerzy Kosinski, and Norman Lear,
   Kurt Vonnegut expends time, money, and his art on behalf of individual
   liberty.

   Norman Dorsen

   Chairman, Board of Directors

   American Civil Liberties Union, New York City

James Wolcott replies:

   What Norman Dorsen calls “irony” sounds to me more like shrugging
   despair. However, since my review may have suggested that Kurt Vonnegut
   is a gloom-sloshed layabout, I’m pleased that Mr. Dorsen has done
   Vonnegut justice by paying tribute to Vonnegut’s exertions “on behalf
   of individual liberty.”

   “A sad spectacle!” exclaimed Thomas Carlyle, contemplating the
   possibility that millions of planets circle other suns. “If they be
   inhabited, what a scope for pain and folly; and if they be not
   inhabited, what a waste of space!”

   Much more is now known about the universe than in Carlyle’s time, but
   the question of whether ETI (a fashionable new acronym for
   Extraterrestrial Intelligence) exists is as open as it ever was.
   However, one incredible new fact has entered the picture. For the first
   time in history we have the technology for maybe answering the
   question. This mere possibility is so overwhelming in its implications
   that a new science called “exobiology” has already been named even
   though its entire subject matter may not exist.

   We do know that our Milky Way galaxy contains more than 200 billion
   suns, and that there are billions of other galaxies. Are there other
   planets? Fifty years ago the two most popular theories about the origin
   of the solar system each made such planetary systems so unlikely that
   top astronomers believed that ours was the only one in the galaxy.
   After flaws were found in both theories, astronomers returned to a
   model proposed by Immanuel Kant (later by Laplace) in which solar
   systems are so likely that most of the Milky Way’s stars must have
   them. The wobblings of a few nearby suns suggest big planets close to
   them, but no one really knows.

   If solar systems are plentiful, our galaxy could contain billions of
   planets earthlike enough to support carbon-based life. Biologists have
   a strong case for confining life to carbon compounds (silicon and boron
   are the next best bets), but no one has any notion of how earthlike a
   planet must be to permit carbon life to arise. Our two nearest
   neighbors, Venus and Mars, were probably formed the same time the earth
   was, yet their atmospheres are strikingly different from each other and
   from ours. Even if a planet goes through an early history exactly like
   our earth’s, no one knows the probability that life on its surface can
   get started. If it does start, no one knows the probability that it
   will evolve anything as intelligent as a fish.

   Our probes of Mars have been great disappointments in SETI (Search for
   ETI). I can still recall the tingling of my spine when as a boy I read
   on the first page of H.G. Wells’s War of the Worlds:

   Yet across the gulf of space, minds that are to our minds as ours are
   to those of the beasts that perish, intellects vast and cool and
   unsympathetic, regarded this earth with envious eyes, and slowly and
   surely drew their plans against us.

   Not even Wells guessed how quickly the Martians would vanish from
   science fiction.

   If we can trust recent polls, half of America believes that ETIs are
   regularly visiting the earth in UFOs, but this is no more than part of
   the big upsurge of enthusiasm for parascience and…

Doctor Auden

   Stuart Hampshire
   February 15, 1968 Issue

Collected Shorter Poems 1927-1957

   by W.H. Auden
   Random House, 351 pp., $7.50

   W. H. Auden W. H. Auden; drawing by David Levine
   It has sometimes been claimed that for several hundred years without
   interruption there has always been a major poet writing in the English
   language Perhaps there have been some dull decades, for which the word
   “major” would need to be stretched a little, when the already
   established resources of the language were just being steadily mined,
   without any new discoveries being made. Mr. Auden began to publish in a
   decade that was very far from being poetically dull. He was almost
   immediately recognized as likely to prolong the necessary line into the
   future. We have now arrived at the future, Mr. Auden is still writing,
   and the continuity holds.

   The mature poetry of Eliot and Yeats surrounded Mr. Auden’s beginnings,
   nearly forty years ago, when the first bright-jacketed Faber volumes
   began to appear. He was an intruder with a harsh voice, and, in The
   Orators and elsewhere, dramatized himself as an enemy of established
   poetical good manners. In his Preface to the Oxford Book of Modern
   Verse, Yeats showed his distaste for Auden’s new reductive style, like
   a metaphysician of that time deploring the logical positivists. There
   was a respectful, veiled hostility between the generations. In the
   Thirties every English undergraduate who cared at all for contemporary
   writing kept these early Auden volumes with him, because they were the
   living, and also lyrical, language of restlessness and dissent. One
   stands in a peculiarly intimate relation to a poet, and even perhaps to
   a philosopher, whose work develops in parallel with one’s own
   experience. A two-way running commentary is established, and one is
   either grateful to the poet for expressing what needs to be expressed
   at the right time, or one is censorious because he has failed to rise
   to some occasion (unknown to him), and because he has perversely taken
   a path of his own and failed to understand what was expected of him.

   Mr. Auden has always left his followers behind. Not least in the
   Preface to this carefully prepared and revised collection, he looks
   back to his own public history in a disclaiming spirit, with a mild and
   elderly gaze and with some surprise. He seems to dislike some of the
   ungentlemanly opinions and political prophecies in his early verse, and
   he has repudiated the untidy involvements of the Thirties. But having
   been, for good reasons, the poet laureate of one disheveled generation,
   at least in England, and having so far found no successor in full
   possession of the title, he cannot now easily slip away into an
   eccentric privacy even if he is no longer representative and is no
   longer a public voice.

   THE ORIGINAL REASONS for his dominance are not too difficult to
   understand. It seemed that in his poetry he never allowed fine fictions
   and believable truths to be divided only by a blurred and disputed
   line. He wanted always to be strictly truthful.…
