   AN ICON GETS SLIMMER AND COOLER.

   The iconic Nike Air Zoom Pegasus 36 returns with more perforations and
   engineered mesh in the upper for targeted breathability across
   high-heat areas. A slimmer heel collar and tongue reduce bulk without
   compromising comfort, while exposed Flywire cables give you a snug fit
   at higher speeds.

   Benefits
     * Perforations on the upper enhance breathability in the forefoot and
       arch.
     * Full-length Zoom Air unit provides a smooth, responsive ride.
     * Slimmer design reduces bulk for a comfortable, conforming fit.
     * Exposed Flywire cables in the midfoot promote a snug fit at higher
       speeds.
     * Cushlon ST foam provides soft, responsive cushioning.
     * High-resiliency sockliner adapts to the contour of your foot for
       support.
     * Waffle pistons on the outsole help absorb impact and provide
       multi-surface traction.
     * Reduced tongue weight from the Pegasus 35 contours to your foot.
     * Heel collar tapers away around the Achilles tendon.
     * Colour Shown: Black/Half Blue/Light Blue/White
     * Style: AQ2210-010

   GabyS961562548 - Sep 06, 2019

   I like the style of the shoe, but after only a couple wears they crease
   badly on the footbed.

   Wow! Great updates!

   Jackieb4 - Jul 11, 2019

   Love, love, love the new Pegasus 36! The cushion/comfort factor was
   amazing from first step. Love the streamlined thin tongue. And the
   laces stay tied, which has been an issue in previous Pegasus. I got the
   bright blue, it looks amazing. The whole shoe seems more sleek and
   supportive.

   saras327147788 - Jun 12, 2019

   I love these shoes!Delived very fast and are so comfortable!I went for
   a 5 mile run the same day I got them and had no blisters or foot pain.
