   Area Maintenance tech (Current Employee) –  Kissimmee, FL – September
   11, 2019
   A particular day at work usually is very interesting; giving me the
   opportunity to provide solutions to the different needs of the
   workplace. At the same time it's a day on which I get to learn new ways
   of providing solutions to the issues that arise. Being able to manage
   critical desicions to complete a designated task and at the same time
   make our staff and customers feel whole. The hardest or my job would be
   lacking the resources needed to satisfy the customer.

   Good Experience
   Front Desk (Former Employee) –  South Beach, FL – October 17, 2018
   I start working at Ocean Blue Hostel as a part time job. The experience
   in general is good.
   What I like the most:
   I have benefits on the schedule, being able to choose my days off or
   being able to take holidays.
   I like the people who work at the hostel, is a nice job environment
   What I don't like:
   The work gets too routinely, there is no space to do an extra.
   The fact the hostel is on top of a bar on Ocean Drive push me
   constantly to kick people from the lobby or not allow people to check
   in. This have became a little dangerous for me when working at night
   and I don't see the point to put myself in that situation.

   Area Maintenance tech (Current Employee) –  Kissimmee, FL – September
   11, 2019
   A particular day at work usually is very interesting; giving me the
   opportunity to provide solutions to the different needs of the
   workplace. At the same time it's a day on which I get to learn new ways
   of providing solutions to the issues that arise. Being able to manage
   critical desicions to complete a designated task and at the same time
   make our staff and customers feel whole. The hardest or my job would be
   lacking the resources needed to satisfy the customer.

   Good Experience
   Front Desk (Former Employee) –  South Beach, FL – October 17, 2018
   I start working at Ocean Blue Hostel as a part time job. The experience
   in general is good.
   What I like the most:
   I have benefits on the schedule, being able to choose my days off or
   being able to take holidays.
   I like the people who work at the hostel, is a nice job environment
   What I don't like:
   The work gets too routinely, there is no space to do an extra.
   The fact the hostel is on top of a bar on Ocean Drive push me
   constantly to kick people from the lobby or not allow people to check
   in. This have became a little dangerous for me when working at night
   and I don't see the point to put myself in that situation.
