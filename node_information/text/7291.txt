Abstract

   Airline pilots and flight engineers are exposed to ionizing radiation
   of cosmic origin and other occupational and life‐style factors that may
   influence their health status and mortality. In a cohort study in 9
   European countries we studied the mortality of this occupational group.
   Cockpit crew cohorts were identified and followed‐up in Denmark,
   Finland, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Norway and
   Sweden, including a total of 28,000 persons. Observed and expected
   deaths for the period 1960–97 were compared based on national mortality
   rates. The influence of period and duration of employment was analyzed
   in stratified and Poisson regression analyses. The study comprised
   547,564 person‐years at risk, and 2,244 deaths were recorded in male
   cockpit crew (standardized mortality ratio [SMR] = 0.64, 95% confidence
   interval [CI] = 0.61–0.67). Overall cancer mortality was decreased (SMR
   = 0.68; 95% CI = 0.63–0.74). We found an increased mortality from
   malignant melanoma (SMR = 1.78, 95% CI = 1.15–2.67) and a reduced
   mortality from lung cancer (SMR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.44–0.62). No
   consistent association between employment period or duration and cancer
   mortality was observed. A low cardiovascular mortality and an increased
   mortality caused by aviation accidents were noted. Our study shows that
   cockpit crew have a low overall mortality. The results are consistent
   with previous reports of an increased risk of malignant melanoma in
   airline pilots. Occupational risk factors apart from aircraft accidents
   seem to be of limited influence with regard to the mortality of cockpit
   crew in Europe. © 2003 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

   Airline pilots and flight engineers are occupationally exposed to
   ionizing radiation of cosmic origin and to electromagnetic fields from
   cockpit instruments.1 Contact with jet fuel and inhalation of fumes2, 3
   could also pose occupational hazards. Whether chronobiological
   disturbances caused by frequent crossing of time zones have any
   long‐term health effects is currently unclear.

   Among other things, the potential hazards of ionizing radiation have
   motivated research focussing on exposure quantification and health
   consequences, in particular as no human data concerning health effects
   of neutrons are available. Cosmic radiation originates from high‐energy
   particles with sources in and outside the solar system. Interactions
   with the atmosphere lead to the creation of neutrons that contribute up
   to 60% to the effective radiation dose.4 Highest radiation doses occur
   in jet flights in high altitude and on polar routes. In‐flight
   measurement approaches5, 6 and dose calculations7 yield rather similar
   results indicating that typical cockpit crew are exposed to annual
   radiation doses in the range 2–6 mSv.

   Epidemiologic cohort studies of cancer incidence and mortality among
   civil aviation cockpit crew have been conducted in North America,8, 9,
   10 Japan11 and European countries.12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20
   Increased risks for malignant melanoma of the skin have been the most
   consistent finding to date. Risk increases for cancers of the brain,
   large bowel, and prostate as well as for leukemia were found in some
   studies, but not in all. Typical findings have included a high risk of
   aviation accidents and decreased mortality from cardiovascular causes.

   Most studies reported so far have been relatively small. Opportunities
   to evaluate dose‐response analyses with e.g., duration of employment or
   other exposure indices have been limited. To address these issues, a
   collaborative European mortality study among flight personnel was set
   up. The primary aim was to assess the mortality of flight crew in
   relation to occupational factors, with a focus on potential effects of
   ionizing radiation. This is a report on the mortality of cockpit crew,
   i.e., pilots and flight engineers, from 9 European countries.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

   The European Study of Cancer Risks among Airline Personnel (ESCAPE) is
   a collaborative European investigation in which cockpit crew cohorts
   were collected in nine countries (Denmark, Finland, Germany, Great
   Britain, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Norway, Sweden) according to a joint
   protocol and subsequently analyzed together. The national cohorts of
   cockpit crew were compiled from varying sources in the participating
   countries (Table I). Procedures have been described previously in more
   detail for most cohorts.12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19 In short, cockpit
   crew were identified from airline personnel files in Finland, Germany,
   Great Britain, Greece, Iceland, Italy and Sweden, supplemented by data
   from airline pilot associations in Finland and Iceland. Pension records
   were used in Great Britain. In Norway, license data of the national
   aviation authority were used for cohort identification and enumeration;
   this source was also used in Iceland. In Denmark, all commercial
   cockpit crew on file in the National Clinic of Aviation Medicine in
   Copenhagen were included.

   The data collected for each individual included name, gender, date of
   birth and employment or license data. Wherever possible, information on
   detailed occupational history was recorded. For each cohort member,
   start of employment and, if retired, end of service as crew member were
   available. In several cohorts further employment data such as aircraft
   type and flight hours were collected and radiation exposure was
   estimated.21, 22, 23 These data were not used in the current analysis
   of the complete cohort as they are still incomplete.

   Follow‐up for the vital status of each individual started at the first
   date of employment or licensing, at immigration, or the
   country‐specific start of follow‐up, whichever was latest, and ended at
   date of death, date of loss to follow‐up, emigration or at the end of
   the study period (end of 1996 or 1997, depending on country) whichever
   came first.

   Follow‐up was carried out through centralized or local population
   registries in most countries. In Denmark, Finland, Great Britain,
   Iceland, Italy, Norway and Sweden causes of deaths were established
   through record linkage with national death registries. In the Nordic
   countries, the unique personal identifier of all cohort members was
   recorded and the linkage done electronically. In Greece social security
   records were used to establish vital status; these records also
   contained the cause of death for deceased cohort members. Follow‐up for
   vital status in Germany was done through population registries and
   local health offices provided copies of death certificates. Information
   from physicians or relatives was retrieved when the death certificate
   was not accessible. All deaths were coded according to the relevant
   revisions of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD
   revisions 7‐10). Data were analyzed centrally at the University of
   Bielefeld, Germany. Cohort members for whom date of birth or date of
   beginning of employment/license were missing were excluded from the
   analysis. Data for female cockpit crew were not analyzed as the cohort
   and the number of deaths were small.

Statistical analysis

   Expected numbers of deaths were computed using cause‐specific
   population mortality rates for each country from the WHO mortality data
   base or supplied by the national statistical offices. The period
   1960–97 was used as time window for the analysis. Person‐years at risk
   and mortality rates were calculated in 5‐year age and calendar
   intervals, and standardized mortality ratios (SMR) were estimated.24
   Because the cause of death was unknown for some persons, a correction
   method proposed recently was applied that allows an improved estimation
   of the SMR in the presence of missing causes of deaths.25 For this
   correction, the observed number of cases is divided by a correction
   factor equation image that represents the proportion of persons with
   known cause of death among all deaths (0 ≤ equation image ≤ 1), thus
   increasing slightly the observed numbers. Appropriately corrected26 95%
   confidence intervals (CI) for the SMR were calculated based on an
   approximation or on exact Poisson distribution. Heterogeneity was
   investigated by χ^2 tests24 and by plotting country‐specific SMR
   results. In addition an analysis of mortality stratified by time since
   first employment for mortality from main causes and
   radiation‐associated cancers was conducted. In a Poisson regression
   analysis the effect of duration of employment/license adjusted for age
   (using 5‐year age groups) and calendar period (categories 1960–69,
   1970–79, 1980–89, 1990–97) was assessed. Further adjustment for country
   did not change risk estimates, but led to model convergence problems in
   several instances.

RESULTS

   An overall cohort of 28,066 male cockpit crew and 262 female cockpit
   crew members was compiled. In total, 279 cohort members had to be
   excluded from the analysis since date of birth, sex or date of first
   employment were unknown. The 27,797 male cockpit crew members finally
   included in the study yielded 547,564 person‐years. Of the total
   cohort, 5.3% emigrated or were otherwise lost to follow‐up.

   Among male cockpit crew, a total of 2,244 deaths (Table II) were
   recorded between 1960–97, yielding an SMR of 0.64 (95% CI = 0.61–0.67).
   Overall cancer mortality was also lower than in the general population
   (SMR = 0.68; 95% CI = 0.63–0.74). Mortality from malignant melanoma was
   increased significantly (SMR = 1.78, 95% CI = 1.15‐2.67), and lung
   cancer mortality was very low (SMR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.44–0.62). For
   most other cancers, the mortality of cockpit crew was slightly lower
   than in the general population, although the SMR differences were not
   significant statistically. Thirty pilots died from leukemia, suggesting
   no excess risk (SMR = 1.05, 95% CI = 0.69–1.50). The results were
   similar for leukemia excluding chronic lymphatic leukemia (non‐CLL
   leukemia; SMR = 1.12, 95% CI = 0.67–1.70). There were 41 brain cancer
   deaths yielding an SMR of 1.20 (95% CI = 0.87–1.67). Among rare cancer
   types not listed in Table II, 3 cases of cancer of the eye were
   observed vs. about 1 case expected (SMR = 2.93, 95% CI = 0.58–8.42).

   Mortality from chronic diseases such as diabetes, respiratory diseases
   and cardiovascular causes was markedly lower than in the reference
   population (Table II). The observed number of cerebrovascular deaths
   was only half the expected (SMR = 0.51; 95% CI 0.41–0.62). More than
   10% of all recorded deaths (n = 244) among cockpit crew were due to
   aircraft accidents (SMR = 88, 95% CI = 77–101), a rare cause of death
   in the general population. Mortality from other accidents (e.g., motor
   vehicle) and other external causes was decreased significantly.

   Analyses according to time since first employment (data not shown)
   showed highest SMRs for all causes during the first 10 years after
   employment and there was no SMR increase with increasing time. For
   cardiovascular diseases a moderate mortality increase over time was
   obvious, but the mortality remained at about 50% of the population
   rates even in the highest category. The Poisson regression analysis to
   evaluate the influence of duration of employment/license as a proxy for
   occupational exposures (Table III) indicated a decreasing mortality
   with increasing employment duration for deaths from all causes (p <
   0.01), cardiovascular disease (p < 0.01), leukemia (p = 0.02) and
   aircraft accidents (p < 0.01). For non‐CLL leukemia no trend across
   duration categories was seen. The colon was the only cancer site for
   which there seemed to be an increased risk with duration of employment
   (RR = 30+ years vs. 0–10 years = 2.01; 95% CI = 0.82–4.91, p‐ = 0.06).

   Country‐specific SMR estimates showed marked differences for several
   causes of death (Table II, Fig. 1a–e). The all cause SMR was 1.43 (95%
   CI = 1.05–1.90) in Iceland whereas SMR point estimates for all other
   countries ranged below one. This difference was caused by the
   particularly high contribution of aircraft accidents to overall deaths
   in Iceland (60%).

   When aircraft accidents were excluded from the analyses, the overall
   ESCAPE‐SMR was reduced to 0.57, but some heterogeneity was still
   present, mainly due to a low overall SMR in Germany (SMR = 0.42) and a
   rather high value for Denmark (SMR = 0.80). Similar differences were
   seen for all cancers, lung cancer and all cardiovascular deaths. The
   test for heterogeneity (Table II) was not statistically significant for
   most other causes of death, but the test power was low in most
   instances. Malignant melanoma deaths were rare overall, and accordingly
   the country‐specific SMR estimates were imprecise, ranging from 0
   (Finland) to 9.1 (Iceland). There was, however, no statistical
   heterogeneity between countries.

DISCUSSION

   Potential health effects of cosmic radiation among cockpit crew have
   become a subject of concern and research recently. Along with other
   aircrew they have been classified as occupationally exposed to ionizing
   radiation since 1996,27 with typical annual exposure levels in the
   range of 2–6 mSv. This amounts to roughly twice the annual background
   radiation dose in most countries28 and is greater than the radiation
   dose that nuclear power plant workers receive. Theoretically a career
   dose of 150 mSv or more could be possible for a pilot, but detailed
   dose estimations carried out for some cohorts19, 21 have not indicated
   cumulative doses exceeding 100 mSv. Nevertheless, late effects of
   cumulative radiation exposure, most notably excess cancer incidence and
   mortality, have been of concern.

   The current study is the largest mortality study among cockpit crew
   published so far, covering more than half of all European cockpit crew
   employed and licensed in the second half of the last century.
   Consistent with studies both included12, 29 and not9 in this analysis
   and a strong healthy worker effect in cockpit crew, the all‐cause
   mortality was markedly decreased. The typical “healthy worker pattern”
   of increasing mortality with increasing time since first employment was
   not seen, however, mainly because of a high risk of death from aircraft
   accidents in the early years of employment or licensing. High social
   status and regular medical examinations may contribute to the low
   mortality. These reasons may also partly explain the observed low
   overall cancer mortality and a lower prevalence of life‐style factors,
   particularly smoking, may play an additional role. No data were
   available on smoking patterns of the overall cohort, but the markedly
   reduced mortality from lung cancer (SMR = 0.53) suggests that smoking
   has been less common among pilots and other cockpit members than in the
   general male population. In addition a cross‐sectional study among
   Canadian pilots30 confirm a very low smoking prevalence of current
   cockpit crew.

   We used the general population of the participating countries as
   reference population. A better defined and more comparable group would
   be an alternative. With regard to cockpit crew, air traffic controllers
   might be such a group, with similar educational level, salary,
   occupational health requirements and exposure to shift work. An even
   better option for the future, however, is to focus on internal
   comparisons if larger numbers of deaths will have occurred after an
   extended follow‐up period.

   Both incidence and mortality from malignant melanoma have been
   increased in previous cockpit crew studies9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 20
   most of which are also included in our analysis. It is difficult to
   demonstrate an excess of melanoma in mortality studies because of the
   high survival rate for this disease. The 1.8‐fold mortality increase
   among cockpit crew in our study was based on 25 melanoma deaths, with
   high risks reported mainly from Northern European countries (except
   Finland). Occupational UV exposure is unlikely as shielding of aircraft
   windows against ultraviolet radiation is effective.31 More frequent
   leisure‐time sunlight exposure has been suggested as a probable
   explanation,12 but more information on this issue is clearly required.
   An association between ionizing radiation and incidence of melanoma
   remains under debate.32, 33, 34 Supporting a possible melanoma‐ionizing
   radiation link, slight increases of melanoma risk among radiologic
   technologists were reported recently.35 Among Nordic pilots,20 a
   positive dose‐response relationship between estimated radiation
   exposure and melanoma incidence was observed although the authors
   concluded that the excess melanoma incidence may well be attributable
   to ultraviolet radiation. Possible interactions between ionizing and
   UV‐radiation36 also require further study.

   For leukemia, previous studies reported risk estimates ranging from
   0.9–1.7 with highest disease risks among Danish jet pilots14 but the
   case numbers were small in most studies. Based on 30 deaths from
   leukemia, no differences between mortality rates of cockpit crew and
   that of the reference population were found. This finding was
   essentially unchanged when the analysis was restricted to non‐CLL
   leukemia. Consistent with earlier studies37, 38, 39 no increased risks
   of other radiation‐induced cancers were seen. A longer follow‐up of our
   cohorts and analyses using more refined exposure data are needed to
   further investigate the risk for leukemia and other
   radiation‐associated malignancies in the future.

   Increased mortality and incidence has been reported previously for
   several other malignancies among cockpit crew, including brain,
   prostate and bowel cancer. The ESCAPE study showed an overall SMR of
   1.2 for brain cancer, with a wide confidence interval. There was a
   tendency for higher risks among those with employment of more than 10
   years duration. Occupational risk factors for brain cancer have not
   been clearly identified.40 In US Air Force pilots, a weak association
   between brain cancer and electromagnetic fields has been found, but a
   much stronger association existed with socio‐economic status.41 In the
   Nordic incidence study,20 no increase of brain cancer incidence was
   observed.

   A suggestive dose‐response relationship between number of block hours
   and incidence of prostate cancer among Nordic airline pilots was
   described recently.20 Our mortality analysis showed no increases for
   prostate cancer mortality in European cockpit crew, with an overall SMR
   of 0.94 and no obvious time‐related variations in mortality.
   Differences between incidence and mortality studies could be due to an
   increased detection rate of early incident prostate cancer among
   cockpit crew. Occupational exposures (radiation, sedentary work) might
   be responsible for a small proportion of the excess risk for cancer of
   the colon associated with longer duration of employment, but other,
   e.g., dietary factors may also play a role.

   Our study confirms the marked cardiovascular mortality reduction of
   cockpit crew9, 11 as compared to the general population. Obviously only
   very healthy persons are recruited into the profession, and continuous
   medical supervision may play a role in controlling cardiovascular risk
   factors. Analyses of mortality by age show that low mortality persists
   even after retirement. As seen in ESCAPE subcohorts12, 18, 29 and
   independent studies8, 9 published previously, aircraft accidents,
   whether private or occupational cause a substantial proportion of
   deaths especially among younger cockpit crew. Pilots in early phases of
   their flight career seem to carry the highest risk of accidental death
   in aviation. Mortality from motor vehicle and other accidents was low.

   Our study has several strengths, among them the large size of the
   cohort and reliable population registration systems and mortality
   statistics in most participating countries. The cohort represents a
   highly complete sample of the source population in the participating
   countries. Where license data were used, all licensed pilots were
   included, in the other countries the largest airline companies supplied
   data. Nevertheless, the results should be interpreted with caution.
   Limitations of epidemiological studies among aircrew include the low
   statistical power due to the small expected risk increases particularly
   for radiation‐induced cancers.42 Additionally our cohort is very young.
   Despite the large number of person‐years at follow‐up, <10% of cohort
   members have died and numbers for many specific cancer sites are still
   small.

   Although cohort members across the different participating countries
   had rather similar working conditions the SMRs for several causes of
   death were significantly different between national sub‐cohorts.
   Despite the common protocol methodological discrepancies may still
   partly explain this observation. More important than the slight
   differences in cohort enumeration, differences in the quality and
   availability of reliable cause of death data could contribute to the
   heterogeneity. Differences in exposure, depending on geographical
   location and routes flown as well as differences in life‐style factors
   and in the staff selection procedure of airlines may also have
   influenced the mortality risks to a minor extent. Clearly,
   country‐specific risk differences for aircraft accidents contributed to
   the heterogeneity of the all‐cause SMR.

   No information on confounding, such as smoking and leisure‐time UV
   exposure, was available. Detailed evaluations of specific causes of
   death including information on confounders would require additional
   data collection. It seems currently that an extension of the follow up
   of the cohort to gain more power for the analyses is feasible and
   important.

   In summary, this large pooled analysis of mortality data from 9
   European countries showed a markedly decreased mortality from all
   causes as well as from cancer and cardiovascular diseases among cockpit
   crew as compared to the general population. Deaths due to aircraft
   accidents were relatively frequent among cockpit crew. Mortality from
   malignant melanoma was raised, but no clear associations with
   employment patterns emerged. Our results do not indicate a substantial
   contribution of occupational factors to the mortality from cancer and
   most other causes among cockpit crew in Europe.

Abstract

   Together with chitin, the β‐glucans are components of mycetes' cell
   walls. A high level of biological efficiency has been found in
   β‐glucans, especially β‐1,3‐D‐glucans and β‐1,6‐D‐glucans isolated from
   some basidiomycetes. (Biological efficiency refers to the relative
   ability of β‐glucans to promote a desired response, for example to
   induce leukocyte activation and to produce inflammatory mediators.)
   These polysaccharides increase the number of Th1 lymphocytes, which
   help protect organisms against allergic reactions. A number of
   β‐glucans, for example pleuran from Oyster (Pleurotus spp.) mushrooms
   or lentinan from Shiitake (Lentinus edodes) mushrooms, have shown
   marked anticarcinogenic activity. In addition to having an
   immunity‐stimulating effect, β‐glucans may participate in physiological
   processes related to the metabolism of fats in the human body. Their
   application results in a decrease in the total cholesterol content in
   blood and may also contribute to reductions in body weight.

Abstract

Objectives

   The objective of this study has been to confirm the sex and the
   affinity of an individual buried in a well‐furnished warrior grave (Bj
   581) in the Viking Age town of Birka, Sweden. Previously, based on the
   material and historical records, the male sex has been associated with
   the gender of the warrior and such was the case with Bj 581. An earlier
   osteological classification of the individual as female was considered
   controversial in a historical and archaeological context. A genomic
   confirmation of the biological sex of the individual was considered
   necessary to solve the issue.

Materials and methods

   Genome‐wide sequence data was generated in order to confirm the
   biological sex, to support skeletal integrity, and to investigate the
   genetic relationship of the individual to ancient individuals as well
   as modern‐day groups. Additionally, a strontium isotope analysis was
   conducted to highlight the mobility of the individual.

Results

   The genomic results revealed the lack of a Y‐chromosome and thus a
   female biological sex, and the mtDNA analyses support a
   single‐individual origin of sampled elements. The genetic affinity is
   close to present‐day North Europeans, and within Sweden to the southern
   and south‐central region. Nevertheless, the Sr values are not
   conclusive as to whether she was of local or nonlocal origin.

Discussion

   The identification of a female Viking warrior provides a unique insight
   into the Viking society, social constructions, and exceptions to the
   norm in the Viking time‐period. The results call for caution against
   generalizations regarding social orders in past societies.

1 INTRODUCTION

   Already in the early middle ages, there were narratives about fierce
   female Vikings fighting alongside men. Although, continuously
   reoccurring in art as well as in poetry, the women warriors have
   generally been dismissed as mythological phenomena (Gardeła, 2013;
   Jesch, 1991; Jochens, 1996).

   Archaeological evidence of warrior graves is numerous, especially in
   the Viking Age of Northern Europe. Situated in Eastern Central Sweden,
   Birka was a key centre for trade during the 8th–late 10th century
   (Figure 1) (S1), linked to a social, cultural and economic network that
   reached beyond the Ural Mountains into the Caliphate in the east and
   south to the Byzantine Empire (Ambrosiani, 2012). Birka's population of
   approximately 700–1000 inhabitants consisted of trading families,
   artisans and warriors (Hedenstierna‐Jonson, 2014). The urban culture in
   Birka was different from the everyday life and practices of the
   surrounding region.

   Map showing the location of Birka and grave Bj 581

   One of the strongest features reflected through the archaeological
   remains is the extent and diversity of contacts and cultural influences
   from other places (Ambrosiani, 2012; Arbman, 1941; Hedenstierna‐Jonson,
   2014), which is also reflected in the diverse burial practice
   (Gräslund, 1980). Over 3,000 graves are known, of which approximately
   1,100 have been excavated, making it one of the largest known
   congregations of burials in the Viking world. The graves are
   distributed over large burial grounds encircling the town area.

   One warrior grave, Bj 581, stands out as exceptionally well‐furnished
   and complete (Arbman, 1941; Thålin‐Bergman, 1986) (Figure 2 and S1).
   Prominently placed on an elevated terrace between the town and a
   hillfort, the grave was in direct contact with Birka's garrison. The
   grave goods include a sword, an axe, a spear, armour‐piercing arrows, a
   battle knife, two shields, and two horses, one mare and one stallion;
   thus, the complete equipment of a professional warrior. Furthermore, a
   full set of gaming pieces indicates knowledge of tactics and strategy
   (van Hamel, 1934; Whittaker, 2006), stressing the buried individual's
   role as a high‐ranking officer. As suggested from the material and
   historical records (Jesch, 1991; Jochens, 1996), the male sex has been
   associated with the gender of a warrior identity. Hence, the individual
   in Bj 581 was considered a male based on the assemblage of grave goods
   (Arbman, 1941; Gräslund, 1980), and the sex was only questioned after a
   full osteological and contextual analysis (Kjellström, 2016) that
   showed that the individual was a woman (S2 and S3). The existence of
   female warriors in Viking Age Scandinavia has been debated among
   scholars (Gardeła, 2013; Jesch, 1991; Jochens, 1996). Though some
   Viking women buried with weapons are known, a female warrior of this
   importance has never been determined and Viking scholars have been
   reluctant to acknowledge the agency of women with weapons (Hernæs,
   1984; Moen, 2011) (S1). The osteological analysis triggered questions
   concerning sex, gender and identity among Viking warriors. This made it
   important to further investigate the biological sex and to do
   additional analyses to explore the genetic affinity of the individual
   buried in Bj 581. Here we present data including nuclear DNA and
   strontium isotopes of the individual.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Osteology

   The skeleton was represented by bone elements from all body regions
   (S2). Stored with Bj 581 was also a femur belonging to another burial
   which was excluded. The age and sex estimation results, presented at a
   conference in 2014 (Kjellström, 2016), were based on osteological
   standard methods for morphologic indicators (Buikstra & Ubelaker, 1994)
   (S2–S3). The epiphyseal union was completed on all preserved bones, and
   the appearance of the auricular surface of the left hip bone meets the
   morphologic criteria for phase 3 according to methods by Lovejoy,
   Meindl, Mensforth, and Pryzbeck (1985) and Meindl and Owen (1989).
   Furthermore, the dental wear of the lower molars was clear but moderate
   (stage 2–4) (Brothwell, 1981). In all, this suggests that the
   individual was at least above 30 years of age. The greater sciatic
   notch of the hip bone was broad, and a wide preauricular sulcus was
   present. This, together with the lack of projection of the mental
   eminence on the mandible, assessed the individual as female.
   Additionally, the long bones are thin, slender and gracile which
   provide further indirect support for the assessment. No pathological or
   traumatic injuries were observed.

2.2 Archaeological samples

   Two samples intended for DNA analyses were removed from individual Bj
   581. The samples were taken from the left canine and the left humerus;
   see Supporting Information Appendix, Section S3 for details.

2.3 DNA extraction and sequencing

   All laboratory procedures were carried out at the Archaeological
   Research Laboratory (AFL), Stockholm University. DNA was extracted
   using urea‐based extraction buffer combined with silica‐based spin
   column purification—MinElute PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen), according
   to the manufactures protocols (Malmström et al., 2009; Yang, Eng, Waye,
   Dudar, & Saunders, 1998). The obtained DNA extracts were used for
   preparation of blunt‐end Illumina genomic libraries (Meyer & Kircher,
   2010). The number of amplification cycles was estimated using gel
   electrophoresis and the libraries were amplified with AmpliTaq^® Gold
   DNA Polymerase (Applied Biosystems™) in six separate PCR reactions. The
   amplified products were pooled, purified with Agencourt AMPure beads
   (Beckman Coulter), quantified using DNA High Sensitivity Kit with
   Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer Instrument (Agilent Technologies) and shotgun
   sequenced on Illumina HiSeq platforms at the Science for Life
   Laboratory Sequencing Centre in Stockholm. Raw DNA data was sorted into
   individual samples based on tagged sequences (de‐multiplexed),
   quality‐controlled and delivered to UPPNEX (UPPmax NEXt Generation
   sequence Cluster & Storage) (Lampa, Dahlo, Olason, Hagberg, & Spjuth,
   2013).

2.4 Sequence analyses

   The computations were performed on resources provided by SNIC through
   Uppsala Multidisciplinary Center for Advanced Computational Science
   (UPPMAX) under the following projects: b2013240, b2015307, and
   b2016056. Sequence data was analyzed following previously published
   procedures (Günther et al., 2015; Omrak et al., 2016). De‐multiplexed
   sequencing pair‐end reads were merged, trimmed and then mapped to the
   human reference genomes build 36 and 37 with BWA v. 0.7.13 (Li &
   Durbin, 2010). The PCR duplicates were removed with
   FilterUniqueSAMCons.py (Kircher, 2012). Obtained DNA fragments were
   then checked for presence of 3′ and 5′ degradation patterns
   characteristic of ancient DNA (Briggs et al., 2007, Brotherton et al.,
   2007, Sawyer, Krause, Guschanski, Savolainen, & Pääbo, 2012) using
   PMDtools (Skoglund et al., 2014). Molecular sex assignment was
   estimated based on the ratio of sequences aligning to the two sex
   chromosomes, X and Y (Skoglund, Storå, Götherström, & Jakobsson, 2013)
   (Figure 3, S4). Levels of contamination were estimated based on the
   analyses of contradictory positions in mitochondrial sequences (Green
   et al., 2008). The consensus mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences were
   called using samtools package (Li et al. 2009) while the initial
   haplogroup assignment was in HAPLOFIND tool (Vianello et al., 2013).
   The assignments were inspected manually by checking against
   PhyloTree–mtDNA tree build 17 (18 February 2016) (van Oven & Kayser,
   2009). For details consult Supporting Information Appendix, Section S4

   et al. (2012) (‡), Raghavan et al. (2014) (†). The biological sex is
   given in parenthesis

2.5 Reference population panel

   The genetic data from the Birka warrior was merged with three different
   population reference data‐sets consisting of genotype SNP data from:
   the Human Origins dataset (Patterson et al., 2012; Lazaridis et al.,
   2014), the Swedish reference (Salmela et al., 2011), and the Population
   Reference Sample–POPRES (Nelson et al., 2008) merged with 60 Yoruban
   individuals from the pilot phase of the 1000 Genomes Project (The 1000
   Genome Project Consortium, 2010). The analyses were restricted to
   nucleotide positions with minimum mapping and base quality of 30.

2.6 Population comparisons

   The principal component analyses (PCA) was undertaken using EIGENSOFT
   v.6.0.1 (Patterson et al., 2006). The analyses were performed with
   pseudo‐haploid genomes and excluding of transition sites. To obtain
   information on genetic affinities between the Birka individual and the
   modern populations, we performed f3‐outgroup statistics using qp3Pop v.
   204 (Patterson et al., 2012) and D statistics which were calculated
   using qpDstat of ADMIXTOOLS (Durand, Patterson, Reich, & Slatkin, 2011;
   Patterson et al., 2012). The results are summarized in Figure 4 and
   Supporting Information Figure S4.2a‐b, S4.3, S4.4, Table S4.4, and

2.7 Strontium isotope analyses

   Three molar teeth from the lower jaw of individual Bj 581 were
   submitted to Sr analyses. For comparison teeth of additional five
   individuals from Birka were also analyzed, Supporting Information
   Table S5.1. For three individuals, including the warrior woman, all
   molars (M1–M3) could be studied and for another three, only the first
   and second molars (M1–M2) were analyzed. Comparative Sr isotopic data
   in tooth enamel from ten other individuals from Birka as well as mean
   values of individuals from other parts of Eastern Middle Sweden were
   collected from earlier publications (Eriksson et al., 2016; Price,
   Frei, & Naumann, 2015). In order to relate the strontium values to
   various regions, the local bioavailable strontium isotope (^87Sr/^86Sr)
   baseline should be established as a reference for comparisons (Bentley,
   2006; Linderholm, Hedenstierna‐Jonson, Svensk, & Lidén, 2008; Slovak &
   Paytan, 2011). Unfortunately, baseline data of the Sr isotopic range in
   the Lake Mälaren Valley is not known. The bedrock in large parts of
   Eastern Middle Sweden, including Birka, belongs to the Baltic Shield
   and comprise of Precambrian crystalline (granitic) rocks but also
   younger metamorphosed rocks, such as sandstone and quartzite
   (Lindström, qvist, Lundqvist, Calner, & Sivhed, 2011). These rocks may
   be expected to have different Sr isotopic values. Available data from
   other regions in Sweden and also the comparative data of humans from
   Eastern Middle Sweden aid interpretations and are considered sufficient
   for the purpose at hand.

3 RESULTS

   Genome‐wide sequence data was generated in order to confirm the
   biological sex, to support skeletal integrity and also to investigate
   the genetic relationship of the individual to ancient individuals and
   modern day groups (S4). We investigated two samples from grave Bj 581,
   the left canine and the left humerus, which both yielded sufficient
   amounts of DNA for further analyses (Supporting Information Table
   S4.1). The DNA was extracted following previously published procedures
   (Günther et al., 2015). The bone extract contained 0.54% endogenous
   human DNA and the tooth extract contained 3.88%. The obtained DNA
   sequences showed all the characteristics of authentic and ancient DNA
   (Briggs et al., 2007) (Supporting Information Figure S4.1a,b), with
   mitochondrial contamination estimated to 0.42% (Green et al., 2008).

   The Birka warrior was sequenced to mean 0.09× nuclear and 326.5×
   mitochondrial genome coverage. The mt‐haplogroup was assigned to T2b
   (Vianello et al., 2013). The total of 11312749 reads mapped to the
   human genome. When corrected for clonality, the number of reads mapping
   to X and Y chromosomes were 248,170 and 247, respectively, resulting in
   the proportion of the alignments (R[Y]) equal to 0.001 (SE = 0.0001).
   The cut‐off value for identification of females is R[Y] ≤ 0.016,
   showing that Bj 581 was a female (Skoglund et al., 2013) (Figure 3).
   Hence the individual in grave Bj 581 is the first confirmed female
   high‐ranking Viking warrior. Finally, we note that both biological sex
   and mtDNA analyses support the single‐individual origin of the analyzed
   cranial and postcranial remains (same sex and mt‐haplogroup T)
   (Supporting Information Table S4.3).

   The Viking warrior female showed genetic affinity to present‐day
   inhabitants of the British Islands (England and Scotland), the North
   Atlantic Islands (Iceland and the Orkneys), Scandinavia (Denmark and
   Norway) and to lesser extent Eastern Baltic Europe (Lithuania and
   Latvia) (Figure 4a,b and Supporting Information Figure S4.2a,b).
   Furthermore, the woman is significantly more similar to these modern
   northern Europeans than to southern Europeans (Supporting Information
   Table S4.5). All of those geographical locations are situated within
   the Viking World. A detailed comparison with modern‐day Swedish
   individuals from across the entire country shows genetic affinities
   between the female warrior and southern and south‐central Swedes
   (Figure 4c).

   The strontium isotope values (^87Sr/^86Sr) in three teeth (first molar
   0.71842, second molar 0.71623, and third molar 0.71687) could suggest
   mobility in her early years (between the formation age of M1 and M2)
   (S5 and Supporting Information Figure S5.1a). The Sr values fall in the
   lower range of other Birka individuals (the mean for all measurements
   in the present study is 0.7214, sd 0.0048) (Supporting Information
   Table S5.1 and Figure S5.1a). The Sr ratio falls outside of the local
   baseline, as estimated on the basis of faunal proxies (Bäckström &
   Price, 2016; Oras et al., 2016; Price et al., 2015; Price, Peets,
   Allmäe, Maldre, & Oras, 2016; Peschel, Carlsson, Bethard, & Beaudry,
   2017; Wilhelmson & Ahlström, 2015) (Supporting Information Figure S5.1b
   and S5.2). Thus, the female warrior, was probably of nonlocal origin
   and, had moved to Birka.

4 DISCUSSION

   Birka embodies the conceptions of the Viking Age as a period of long
   distance connections, trade, crafts and warfare. The archaeological
   material provides a reference for the Viking Age. At Birka, grave Bj
   581 was brought forward as an example of an elaborate high‐status male
   warrior grave. This image of the male warrior in a patriarchal society
   was reinforced by research traditions and contemporary preconceptions
   (Moen, 2011). Hence, the biological sex of the individual was taken for
   granted.

   A first osteological analysis done in the 1970ies identified the
   skeleton as a female, but this could not generate further discussion as
   the skeleton could not securely be associated to a context. When the
   sex identification and a proper contextualisation was made, and set in
   relation to the objects (Kjellström, 2016), questions were still raised
   if the martial objects in the grave mirrored the identity of the
   deceased. Similar associations of women buried with weapons have been
   dismissed, arguing that the armaments could have been heirlooms,
   carriers of symbolic meaning or grave goods reflecting the status and
   role of the family rather than the individual (Gardeła, 2013). Male
   individuals in burials with a similar material record are not
   questioned in the same way. Furthermore, an argument can be put forward
   that the grave originally may have held a second, now missing,
   individual. In which case, the weaponry could have been a part of that
   individual's grave furnishings, while the remaining female was buried
   without any objects. However, the distribution of the grave goods
   within the grave, their spatial relation to the female individual and
   the total lack of any typically female attributed grave artefacts
   disputes this possibility.

   Do weapons necessarily determine a warrior? The interpretation of grave
   goods is not straight forward, but it must be stressed that the
   interpretation should be made in a similar manner regardless of the
   biological sex of the interred individual. Furthermore, the exclusive
   grave goods and two horses are worthy of an individual with
   responsibilities concerning strategy and battle tactics. The skeletal
   remains in grave Bj 581 did not exhibit signs of antemortem or
   perimortem trauma which could support the notion that the individual
   had been a warrior. However, contrary to what could be expected, weapon
   related wounds (and trauma in general) are not common in the inhumation
   burials at Birka (e.g., 2 out of 49 confirmed males showed signs of
   sharp force trauma). A similarly low frequency is noted at
   contemporaneous cemeteries in Scandinavia (e.g., Helgesson Arcini,
   1996). Traces of violent trauma are more common in Viking Age mass
   burials (e.g., Loe, Boyle, Webb, & Score, 2014; Price et al., 2016).

   Although not possible to rule out, previous arguments have likely
   neglected intersectional perspectives where the social status of the
   individual was considered of greater importance than biological sex.
   This type of reasoning takes away the agency of the buried female. As
   long as the sex is male, the weaponry in the grave not only belong to
   the interred but also reflects his status as warrior, whereas a female
   sex has raised doubts, not only regarding her ascribed role but also in
   her association to the grave goods.

   Grave Bj 581 is one of three known examples where the individual has
   been treated in accordance with prevailing warrior ideals lacking all
   associations with the female gender (Jesch, 2009) (S1, S2, and S3).
   Furthermore, the exclusive grave goods and two horses are worthy of an
   individual with responsibilities concerning strategy and battle
   tactics. Our results caution against sweeping interpretations based on
   archaeological contexts and preconceptions. They provide a new
   understanding of the Viking society, the social constructions and also
   norms in the Viking Age. The genetic and strontium data also show that
   the female warrior was mobile, a pattern that is implied in the
   historical sources, especially when it comes to the extended households
   of the elite (cf. Steinsland, Sigurđsson, Rekdal, & Beuermann, 2011).
   The female Viking warrior was part of a society that dominated 8th to
   10th century northern Europe. Our results—that the high‐status grave Bj
   581 on Birka was the burial of a high ranking female Viking
   warrior—suggest that women, indeed, were able to be full members of
   male dominated spheres. Questions of biological sex, gender and social
   roles are complex and were so also in the Viking Age. This study shows
   how the combination of ancient genomics, isotope analyses and
   archaeology can contribute to the rewriting of our understanding of
   social organization concerning gender, mobility and occupation patterns
   in past societies.

     Then the high‐born lady saw them play the wounding game,

     she resolved on a hard course and flung off her cloak;

     she took a naked sword and fought for her kinsmen's lives,

     she was handy at fighting, wherever she aimed her blows.
