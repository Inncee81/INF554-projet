   Word of the Day : October 2, 2019

sawbones

   noun SAW-bohnz

Definition

   slang : physician, surgeon

Did You Know?

   Sawbones cut its first literary tooth in Charles Dickens's 1837 novel
   The Pickwick Papers, when Sam Weller says to Mr. Pickwick, "Don't you
   know what a sawbones is, sir? … I thought everybody know'd as a
   sawbones was a surgeon." An evocative term that calls to mind the saws
   that 19th-century surgeons used to perform amputations, sawbones
   quickly became an established member of the English language, employed
   by such authors as H. G. Wells, Mark Twain, and Robert Louis Stevenson.
   Mercifully, medical technology has improved dramatically since then
   (the surgical saws used in procedures today are a far cry from the
   primitive tools of yesteryear), but the word sawbones is still used,
   often in a humorous context.

Examples

   "After abandoning his destitute family in 1913, Brinkley bought a
   medical degree from a 'diploma mill' in St. Louis. An itinerant
   preacher assured him that he did not have to be a bona fide sawbones to
   cure the ills of the world." — Bartee Haile, The Courier (Montgomery
   County, Texas), 19 Jan. 2018

   "Anyway, his relatives … reminded him that it's hard to shine shoes
   without a heartbeat. So he went back to his sawbones to talk about the
   pacemaker." — Phil Luciano, The Journal Star (Peoria, Illinois), 28
