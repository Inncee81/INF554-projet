Guide to Upcountry Maui

   recommend my absolute favorites to you. Thank you for supporting the

   Are you planning a trip to Maui? Yippee if you are! You’re probably
   thinking about swaying palm trees, golden sandy beaches, and exotic
   marine life and while the land of the hula certainly has all of that,
   it has much, much more. The vast majority of space on Maui isn’t the
   shoreline where so many visitors flock each year, but rather the
   “upcountry.”

   Stretching to include the cowboy country of Makawao, the farmland of
   Kula, the eucalyptus forests of Ulupalakua, and the slopes of
   Haleakala, exploring upcountry Maui (including the lavender farm Maui)
   will give you a different perspective of life on the honeymooner’s
   isle. This is were the people live and if you spend a day or two here
   you’ll understand why.

Driving the Road to Hana, Maui

   September 30, 2019 by caitylincoln

   UPDATE: For real time coverage of my latest road to Hana trip with
   geotags, videos, and pictures of food truck menus, watch the “Road to
   Hana” highlight on my Instagram account (@hula.land).

   Maui’s Road to Hana is one of the most famous (or infamous) drives in
   the world and in my opinion is the #1 don’t miss thing to do on Maui.

   What makes this drive so special? The Road to Hana is over 50 miles
   along Maui’s rugged north shore and east side with 600+ tight turns and
   about 50 one-lane bridges. Sound fun? It is! While it has the
   reputation among many as being a hair raisingly dangerous adventure,
   driving the Road to Hana is certainly a once in a lifetime adventure
   but not nearly as treacherous as many make it out to be.

   I’ve driven the Road to Hana at least a half dozen times. I’ve done it
   by myself, with a car full (including a baby in a car seat!), in a
   Jeep, in a sedan, and even in a full sized pickup. I’ve even done the
   backside of the Road to Hana (the road past Hana) many times! I’m
   pulling together everything I’ve learned driving the Road to Hana from
   the very best stops to make to tips about what to expect. So…here we
   go!

What to Expect

   I’ve already mentioned the 600+ sharp turns and 50+ single lane bridges
   so you probably already have a pretty harrowing image in your head
   right? Don’t worry, it’s really not so bad! The entire road from Paia
   to Hana (and even beyond) is entirely paved and two lanes. The bridges
   are not two lanes, however there’s an understood rule of letting 6-7
   cars on either side pass at a time. In general, while the road is very
   winding, it’s relatively flat and there are very few drop offs (and
   there are guard rails protecting the few you will find).

   What you can expect along the Road to Hana is plenty of beauty. You’ll
   see colorful, lush vegetation, wide sweeping views and so many
   waterfalls. Perhaps the most important thing to understand about
   driving the Road to Hana is that it’s about the journey, not the
   destination. Hana itself isn’t much to speak of. It’s a quiet little
   town with a gas station, a general store, and not much else. So this
   drive is less about “hurry up and get to Hana” and more about enjoying
   the adventure.

   Now, on to the good stuff.

   RELATED: Not very familiar with Maui? Read up on the lay of the
   is(land) and where to stay plus my favorite beach resorts, budget
   hotels, condos, honeymoon resorts, family friendly resorts, luxury
   resorts, and boutique hotels plus my area specific guides (including
   where to stay, eat, and things to do) for Wailea and Ka’anapali.

Stops on the Road to Hana

   North shore spots: The Road to Hana officially begins in Paia (a cute
   little town on the north shore), but don’t plan on spending much time
   at any spots in the Paia/Haiku area on the day you do the Road to Hana.
   This includes exploring Paia town, stopping at Ho’okipa overlook, or
   hiking to Twill Falls. These are all things you should do, but do them
   on another day. Getting to the north shore from Kihei or Lahaina isn’t
   all that far. You’ll need the FULL day to see all of the highlights on
   the eastern side of the island. So grab breakfast in Paia, pick up a
   picnic lunch, fill up your gas tank, and hit the road!

10 Condos on Kauai Under $100/Night

   September 11, 2019 by caitylincoln

   This post may contain some affiliate links, which means I’ll make a
   little money on anything you choose to purchase. But of course, I only
   recommend my absolute favorites to you. Thank you for supporting the
   brands that make Hulaland possible.

   The most difficult part of planning a Hawaiian vacation for me is
   deciding where to stay. While I love luxurious beach resorts as much as
   the next girl, most of my trips to Hawaii tend to be pretty active
   (especially Kauai!), and it just doesn’t make sense to pay an arm and a
   leg to stay at a fancy place when I’ll be spending most of my days
   hiking in Waimea Canyon or boating down the Napali Coast. But…sometimes
   I like a little more comfort than a budget hotel provides. Luckily,
   I’ve figured out the perfect way to save some cash and still get
   amazing amenities by staying in a condo or vacation rental!

   Hawaii has a great variety of accommodation options, which makes it the
   perfect place to try out a vacation rental. Since Hawaii is a major
   vacation destination, there are of course MANY condos to choose from
   but besides condos, Hawaii has a ton of “ohanas.” Ohana means family
   (any Lilo and Stitch fans out there???) and in Hawaii the term is
   applied to separate living units located on the same property as the
   main house. Many homes in Hawaii are divided up into multiple spaces
   (each with its own private entrance, bathroom, kitchenette, etc.) while
   some have a guest cottage on the property. Because so many homes are
   configured this way, it’s easy to find a private apartment or cottage
   on the same property with a local host.

   There are several ways you’ll save money on a trip to Oahu by staying
   in a condo or vacation rental. The biggest way you’ll save money is
   that it’s soooo much cheaper than staying at a resort or hotel. On many
   islands you can find condos or ohanas either right on or just a block
   or two from the beach. Plus, resorts can get expensive really fast if
   you have more than two adults staying in a room. Rental units are
   perfect for larger parties who can rent an entire house or multi
   bedroom condo and split the cost. Another big benefit that rentals
   offer is the full kitchen (or kitchenette depending on what you book).
   Having a place to cook some meals and a fridge to store snacks and
   drinks can really save you a lot.

What should you look for in a vacation rental?

   Before you start looking around for specific condos or rentals, it’s
   best to have a general idea of where you want to stay. If you’re not
   very familiar with Kauai, you should read this post to get the lay of
   the is(land) and decide which area you’d most like to stay.

   Consider what you need. What’s important to you? Are you looking for a
   specific location near a certain beach or resort area? Do you need a
   full kitchen? Reliable Wi-Fi? A full house or just studio? Be clear
   about what you want before you start searching.

9 Condos on Oahu under $100/Night

   A trip to Hawaii can be a once in a lifetime experience, but wow can it
   be hard settling on a good place to stay! If you’re on a budget and
   trying to avoid paying resort prices, or you’re just looking for a
   little something different (maybe a more local experience?) then a
   condo or vacation rental on Oahu is perfect for you!

   very familiar with Oahu, you should read this post to get the lay of
   the is(land) and decide which area you’d most like to stay. But before
   you start looking, you should know that by far the bulk of
   accommodations are located in Waikiki (a neighborhood of Honolulu), and
   Oahu just passed legislation that limits the rentals in “local” parts
   of the island. More on that below.

   Consider what you need. What’s important to you? Are you looking for a
   specific location near a certain beach or resort area? Do you need a
   full kitchen? Reliable Wi-Fi? A full house or just studio? Be clear
   about what you want before you start searching.

   Read reviews. Before you even consider staying at a property, you
   should read up on what people who have stayed there have to say.
   Remember, you’ll only hear the good points from the host but reviews
   usually give a much more honest story. And when I’m weeding through
   listings, I also put a lot of weight into the photographs provided. If
   the photos look professional, it probably means that the owner runs
   their vacation rental in a professional manner and that is a indication
   that it’s a good place to stay.

   Ask plenty of questions. When you’re seriously considering staying at a
   specific property, you should correspond with the owner and ask them
   any questions you may have.

   Count the extra costs. Be sure to factor in any security deposits,
   cleaning fees, and booking fees.

   Know the cancellation policy. Each property and owner may have
   different terms so know what they are before you commit.

   Are you struggling finding the perfect place to stay on the Big Island?
   Picking just the right spot is usually one of the hardest parts for me
   when I’m planning a trip. I love staying at fancy beach resorts (pretty
   much more than anything!), but it just doesn’t always make sense to pay
   so much money when I’ll be spending most of my days hiking in Hawaii
   Volcano National Park or visiting amazing colored sand beaches.

   So I’ve got the perfect solution for you…you can save a bundle and
   still get amazing amenities by staying in a condo or vacation rental on
   the Big Island!

   but besides condos, Hawaii has a ton of “ohanas.” Ohana means family
   (any Lilo and Stitch fans out there???) and in Hawaii the term is
   applied to separate living units located on the same property as the
   main house. Many homes in Hawaii are divided up into multiple spaces
   (each with its own private entrance, bathroom, kitchenette, etc.) while
   some have a guest cottage on the property. Because so many homes are
   configured this way, it’s easy to find a private apartment or cottage
   on the same property with a local host.

   There are several ways you’ll save money on a trip to Oahu by staying
   in a condo or vacation rental. The biggest way you’ll save money is
   that it’s soooo much cheaper than staying at a resort or hotel. On many
   islands you can find condos or ohanas either right on or just a block
   or two from the beach. Plus, resorts can get expensive really fast if
   you have more than two adults staying in a room. Rental units are
   perfect for larger parties who can rent an entire house or multi
   bedroom condo and split the cost. Another big benefit that rentals
   offer is the full kitchen (or kitchenette depending on what you book).
   Having a place to cook some meals and a fridge to store snacks and
   drinks can really save you a lot.

What should you look for in a vacation rental?

   Before you start looking around for specific condos or rentals, it’s
   best to have a general idea of where you want to stay. If you’re not
   very familiar with Oahu, you should read this post to get the lay of
   the is(land) and decide which area you’d most like to stay. But before
   you start looking, you should know that by far the bulk of
   accommodations are located in Waikiki (a neighborhood of Honolulu), and
   Oahu just passed legislation that limits the rentals in “local” parts
   of the island. More on that below.

   Consider what you need. What’s important to you? Are you looking for a
   specific location near a certain beach or resort area? Do you need a
   full kitchen? Reliable Wi-Fi? A full house or just studio? Be clear
   about what you want before you start searching.

   Read reviews. Before you even consider staying at a property, you
   should read up on what people who have stayed there have to say.
   Remember, you’ll only hear the good points from the host but reviews
   usually give a much more honest story. And when I’m weeding through
   listings, I also put a lot of weight into the photographs provided. If
   the photos look professional, it probably means that the owner runs
   their vacation rental in a professional manner and that is a indication
   that it’s a good place to stay.

   Ask plenty of questions. When you’re seriously considering staying at a
   specific property, you should correspond with the owner and ask them
   any questions you may have.

   Count the extra costs. Be sure to factor in any security deposits,
   cleaning fees, and booking fees.

   Know the cancellation policy. Each property and owner may have
   different terms so know what they are before you commit.

13 Vacation Rentals on the Big Island Under $100/Night

   little money on anything you choose to purchase. But of course, I only

   Are you struggling finding the perfect place to stay on the Big Island?
   Picking just the right spot is usually one of the hardest parts for me
   when I’m planning a trip. I love staying at fancy beach resorts (pretty
   much more than anything!), but it just doesn’t always make sense to pay
   so much money when I’ll be spending most of my days hiking in Hawaii
   Volcano National Park or visiting amazing colored sand beaches.

   So I’ve got the perfect solution for you…you can save a bundle and
   still get amazing amenities by staying in a condo or vacation rental on
   the Big Island!

   Hawaii has a great variety of accommodation options, which makes it the
   perfect place to try out a vacation rental. Since Hawaii is a major

Guide to Upcountry Maui

   October 1, 2019 by caitylincoln

   This post may contain some affiliate links, which means I’ll make a
   little money on anything you choose to purchase. But of course, I only
   recommend my absolute favorites to you. Thank you for supporting the
   brands that make Hulaland possible.

   Are you planning a trip to Maui? Yippee if you are! You’re probably
   thinking about swaying palm trees, golden sandy beaches, and exotic
   marine life and while the land of the hula certainly has all of that,
   it has much, much more. The vast majority of space on Maui isn’t the
   shoreline where so many visitors flock each year, but rather the
   “upcountry.”

   Stretching to include the cowboy country of Makawao, the farmland of
   Kula, the eucalyptus forests of Ulupalakua, and the slopes of
   Haleakala, exploring upcountry Maui (including the lavender farm Maui)
   will give you a different perspective of life on the honeymooner’s
   isle. This is were the people live and if you spend a day or two here
   you’ll understand why.

Driving the Road to Hana, Maui

   September 30, 2019 by caitylincoln

   UPDATE: For real time coverage of my latest road to Hana trip with
   geotags, videos, and pictures of food truck menus, watch the “Road to
   Hana” highlight on my Instagram account (@hula.land).

   Maui’s Road to Hana is one of the most famous (or infamous) drives in
   the world and in my opinion is the #1 don’t miss thing to do on Maui.

   What makes this drive so special? The Road to Hana is over 50 miles
   along Maui’s rugged north shore and east side with 600+ tight turns and
   about 50 one-lane bridges. Sound fun? It is! While it has the
   reputation among many as being a hair raisingly dangerous adventure,
   driving the Road to Hana is certainly a once in a lifetime adventure
   but not nearly as treacherous as many make it out to be.

   I’ve driven the Road to Hana at least a half dozen times. I’ve done it
   by myself, with a car full (including a baby in a car seat!), in a
   Jeep, in a sedan, and even in a full sized pickup. I’ve even done the
   backside of the Road to Hana (the road past Hana) many times! I’m
   pulling together everything I’ve learned driving the Road to Hana from
   the very best stops to make to tips about what to expect. So…here we
   go!

What to Expect

   I’ve already mentioned the 600+ sharp turns and 50+ single lane bridges
   so you probably already have a pretty harrowing image in your head
   right? Don’t worry, it’s really not so bad! The entire road from Paia
   to Hana (and even beyond) is entirely paved and two lanes. The bridges
   are not two lanes, however there’s an understood rule of letting 6-7
   cars on either side pass at a time. In general, while the road is very
   winding, it’s relatively flat and there are very few drop offs (and
   there are guard rails protecting the few you will find).

   What you can expect along the Road to Hana is plenty of beauty. You’ll
   see colorful, lush vegetation, wide sweeping views and so many
   waterfalls. Perhaps the most important thing to understand about
   driving the Road to Hana is that it’s about the journey, not the
   destination. Hana itself isn’t much to speak of. It’s a quiet little
   town with a gas station, a general store, and not much else. So this
   drive is less about “hurry up and get to Hana” and more about enjoying
   the adventure.

   Now, on to the good stuff.

   RELATED: Not very familiar with Maui? Read up on the lay of the
   is(land) and where to stay plus my favorite beach resorts, budget
   hotels, condos, honeymoon resorts, family friendly resorts, luxury
   resorts, and boutique hotels plus my area specific guides (including
   where to stay, eat, and things to do) for Wailea and Ka’anapali.

Stops on the Road to Hana

   North shore spots: The Road to Hana officially begins in Paia (a cute
   little town on the north shore), but don’t plan on spending much time
   at any spots in the Paia/Haiku area on the day you do the Road to Hana.
   This includes exploring Paia town, stopping at Ho’okipa overlook, or
   hiking to Twill Falls. These are all things you should do, but do them
   on another day. Getting to the north shore from Kihei or Lahaina isn’t
   all that far. You’ll need the FULL day to see all of the highlights on
   the eastern side of the island. So grab breakfast in Paia, pick up a
   picnic lunch, fill up your gas tank, and hit the road!

10 Condos on Kauai Under $100/Night

   September 11, 2019 by caitylincoln

   This post may contain some affiliate links, which means I’ll make a
   little money on anything you choose to purchase. But of course, I only
   recommend my absolute favorites to you. Thank you for supporting the
   brands that make Hulaland possible.

   The most difficult part of planning a Hawaiian vacation for me is
   deciding where to stay. While I love luxurious beach resorts as much as
   the next girl, most of my trips to Hawaii tend to be pretty active
   (especially Kauai!), and it just doesn’t make sense to pay an arm and a
   leg to stay at a fancy place when I’ll be spending most of my days
   hiking in Waimea Canyon or boating down the Napali Coast. But…sometimes
   I like a little more comfort than a budget hotel provides. Luckily,
   I’ve figured out the perfect way to save some cash and still get
   amazing amenities by staying in a condo or vacation rental!

   Hawaii has a great variety of accommodation options, which makes it the
   perfect place to try out a vacation rental. Since Hawaii is a major
   vacation destination, there are of course MANY condos to choose from
   but besides condos, Hawaii has a ton of “ohanas.” Ohana means family
   (any Lilo and Stitch fans out there???) and in Hawaii the term is
   applied to separate living units located on the same property as the
   main house. Many homes in Hawaii are divided up into multiple spaces
   (each with its own private entrance, bathroom, kitchenette, etc.) while
   some have a guest cottage on the property. Because so many homes are
   configured this way, it’s easy to find a private apartment or cottage
   on the same property with a local host.

   There are several ways you’ll save money on a trip to Oahu by staying
   in a condo or vacation rental. The biggest way you’ll save money is
   that it’s soooo much cheaper than staying at a resort or hotel. On many
   islands you can find condos or ohanas either right on or just a block
   or two from the beach. Plus, resorts can get expensive really fast if
   you have more than two adults staying in a room. Rental units are
   perfect for larger parties who can rent an entire house or multi
   bedroom condo and split the cost. Another big benefit that rentals
   offer is the full kitchen (or kitchenette depending on what you book).
   Having a place to cook some meals and a fridge to store snacks and
   drinks can really save you a lot.

What should you look for in a vacation rental?

   Before you start looking around for specific condos or rentals, it’s
   best to have a general idea of where you want to stay. If you’re not
   very familiar with Kauai, you should read this post to get the lay of
   the is(land) and decide which area you’d most like to stay.

   A trip to Hawaii can be a once in a lifetime experience, but wow can it

Guide to Upcountry Maui

   Are you planning a trip to Maui? Yippee if you are! You’re probably
   thinking about swaying palm trees, golden sandy beaches, and exotic
   marine life and while the land of the hula certainly has all of that,
   it has much, much more. The vast majority of space on Maui isn’t the
   shoreline where so many visitors flock each year, but rather the
   “upcountry.”

   Stretching to include the cowboy country of Makawao, the farmland of
   Kula, the eucalyptus forests of Ulupalakua, and the slopes of
   Haleakala, exploring upcountry Maui (including the lavender farm Maui)
   will give you a different perspective of life on the honeymooner’s
   isle. This is were the people live and if you spend a day or two here
   you’ll understand why.

Driving the Road to Hana, Maui

   September 30, 2019 by caitylincoln

   UPDATE: For real time coverage of my latest road to Hana trip with
   geotags, videos, and pictures of food truck menus, watch the “Road to
   Hana” highlight on my Instagram account (@hula.land).

   Maui’s Road to Hana is one of the most famous (or infamous) drives in
   the world and in my opinion is the #1 don’t miss thing to do on Maui.

   What makes this drive so special? The Road to Hana is over 50 miles
   along Maui’s rugged north shore and east side with 600+ tight turns and
   about 50 one-lane bridges. Sound fun? It is! While it has the
   reputation among many as being a hair raisingly dangerous adventure,
   driving the Road to Hana is certainly a once in a lifetime adventure
   but not nearly as treacherous as many make it out to be.

   I’ve driven the Road to Hana at least a half dozen times. I’ve done it
   by myself, with a car full (including a baby in a car seat!), in a
   Jeep, in a sedan, and even in a full sized pickup. I’ve even done the
   backside of the Road to Hana (the road past Hana) many times! I’m
   pulling together everything I’ve learned driving the Road to Hana from
   the very best stops to make to tips about what to expect. So…here we
   go!

What to Expect

   I’ve already mentioned the 600+ sharp turns and 50+ single lane bridges
   so you probably already have a pretty harrowing image in your head
   right? Don’t worry, it’s really not so bad! The entire road from Paia
   to Hana (and even beyond) is entirely paved and two lanes. The bridges
   are not two lanes, however there’s an understood rule of letting 6-7
   cars on either side pass at a time. In general, while the road is very
   winding, it’s relatively flat and there are very few drop offs (and
   there are guard rails protecting the few you will find).

   What you can expect along the Road to Hana is plenty of beauty. You’ll
   see colorful, lush vegetation, wide sweeping views and so many
   waterfalls. Perhaps the most important thing to understand about
   driving the Road to Hana is that it’s about the journey, not the
   destination. Hana itself isn’t much to speak of. It’s a quiet little
   town with a gas station, a general store, and not much else. So this
   drive is less about “hurry up and get to Hana” and more about enjoying
   the adventure.

   Now, on to the good stuff.

   is(land) and where to stay plus my favorite beach resorts, budget
   hotels, condos, honeymoon resorts, family friendly resorts, luxury
   resorts, and boutique hotels plus my area specific guides (including
   where to stay, eat, and things to do) for Wailea and Ka’anapali.

Stops on the Road to Hana

   North shore spots: The Road to Hana officially begins in Paia (a cute
   little town on the north shore), but don’t plan on spending much time
   at any spots in the Paia/Haiku area on the day you do the Road to Hana.
   This includes exploring Paia town, stopping at Ho’okipa overlook, or
   hiking to Twill Falls. These are all things you should do, but do them
   on another day. Getting to the north shore from Kihei or Lahaina isn’t
   all that far. You’ll need the FULL day to see all of the highlights on
   the eastern side of the island. So grab breakfast in Paia, pick up a
   picnic lunch, fill up your gas tank, and hit the road!

10 Condos on Kauai Under $100/Night

   September 11, 2019 by caitylincoln

   This post may contain some affiliate links, which means I’ll make a
   little money on anything you choose to purchase. But of course, I only
   recommend my absolute favorites to you. Thank you for supporting the
   brands that make Hulaland possible.

   The most difficult part of planning a Hawaiian vacation for me is
   deciding where to stay. While I love luxurious beach resorts as much as
   the next girl, most of my trips to Hawaii tend to be pretty active
   (especially Kauai!), and it just doesn’t make sense to pay an arm and a
   leg to stay at a fancy place when I’ll be spending most of my days
   hiking in Waimea Canyon or boating down the Napali Coast. But…sometimes
   I like a little more comfort than a budget hotel provides. Luckily,
   I’ve figured out the perfect way to save some cash and still get
   amazing amenities by staying in a condo or vacation rental!

   Hawaii has a great variety of accommodation options, which makes it the
   perfect place to try out a vacation rental. Since Hawaii is a major
   vacation destination, there are of course MANY condos to choose from
   but besides condos, Hawaii has a ton of “ohanas.” Ohana means family
   (any Lilo and Stitch fans out there???) and in Hawaii the term is
   applied to separate living units located on the same property as the
   main house. Many homes in Hawaii are divided up into multiple spaces
   (each with its own private entrance, bathroom, kitchenette, etc.) while
   some have a guest cottage on the property. Because so many homes are
   configured this way, it’s easy to find a private apartment or cottage
   on the same property with a local host.

   There are several ways you’ll save money on a trip to Oahu by staying
   in a condo or vacation rental. The biggest way you’ll save money is
   that it’s soooo much cheaper than staying at a resort or hotel. On many
   islands you can find condos or ohanas either right on or just a block
   or two from the beach. Plus, resorts can get expensive really fast if
   you have more than two adults staying in a room. Rental units are
   perfect for larger parties who can rent an entire house or multi
   bedroom condo and split the cost. Another big benefit that rentals
   offer is the full kitchen (or kitchenette depending on what you book).
   Having a place to cook some meals and a fridge to store snacks and
   drinks can really save you a lot.

What should you look for in a vacation rental?

   Before you start looking around for specific condos or rentals, it’s
   best to have a general idea of where you want to stay. If you’re not
   very familiar with Kauai, you should read this post to get the lay of
   the is(land) and decide which area you’d most like to stay.

   Consider what you need. What’s important to you? Are you looking for a
   specific location near a certain beach or resort area? Do you need a
   full kitchen? Reliable Wi-Fi? A full house or just studio? Be clear
   about what you want before you start searching.

9 Condos on Oahu under $100/Night

   A trip to Hawaii can be a once in a lifetime experience, but wow can it
   be hard settling on a good place to stay! If you’re on a budget and
   trying to avoid paying resort prices, or you’re just looking for a
   little something different (maybe a more local experience?) then a
   condo or vacation rental on Oahu is perfect for you!

   Hawaii has a great variety of accommodation options, which makes it the
   perfect place to try out a vacation rental. Since Hawaii is a major
   vacation destination, there are of course MANY condos to choose from

   very familiar with Oahu, you should read this post to get the lay of
   the is(land) and decide which area you’d most like to stay. But before
   you start looking, you should know that by far the bulk of
   accommodations are located in Waikiki (a neighborhood of Honolulu), and
   Oahu just passed legislation that limits the rentals in “local” parts
   of the island. More on that below.

   Consider what you need. What’s important to you? Are you looking for a
   specific location near a certain beach or resort area? Do you need a
   full kitchen? Reliable Wi-Fi? A full house or just studio? Be clear
   about what you want before you start searching.

   Read reviews. Before you even consider staying at a property, you
   should read up on what people who have stayed there have to say.
   Remember, you’ll only hear the good points from the host but reviews
   usually give a much more honest story. And when I’m weeding through
   listings, I also put a lot of weight into the photographs provided. If
   the photos look professional, it probably means that the owner runs
   their vacation rental in a professional manner and that is a indication
   that it’s a good place to stay.

   Ask plenty of questions. When you’re seriously considering staying at a
   specific property, you should correspond with the owner and ask them
   any questions you may have.

   Count the extra costs. Be sure to factor in any security deposits,
   cleaning fees, and booking fees.

   Know the cancellation policy. Each property and owner may have
   different terms so know what they are before you commit.

   Are you struggling finding the perfect place to stay on the Big Island?
   Picking just the right spot is usually one of the hardest parts for me
   when I’m planning a trip. I love staying at fancy beach resorts (pretty
   much more than anything!), but it just doesn’t always make sense to pay
   so much money when I’ll be spending most of my days hiking in Hawaii
   Volcano National Park or visiting amazing colored sand beaches.

   So I’ve got the perfect solution for you…you can save a bundle and
   still get amazing amenities by staying in a condo or vacation rental on
   the Big Island!
