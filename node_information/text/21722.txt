Heartbreaking Post On Euthanasia From A Vet That Has To Perform It Goes Viral

   Whenever we have to let go of our beloved pets, the pain is unbearable.
   In fact, the emotions overwhelm us so much, we forget about the rest of
   the world. And that’s only natural. But many times, there’s someone
   sharing the hurt. In the cases of euthanasia, for example, it’s the
   carrier of death. Recently, Brenda Gough from Burford, Ontario penned
   an emotional Facebook post, explaining how the vets feel when pushing
   the needle into our little buddies, taking them to the other side.

   Brenda’s honesty is vivid in every word of the text, which has already
   received over 112K reactions and 123K shares. And while it can’t bring
   back our pets, knowing that there’s somebody who’s going through the
   crushing experience with you might just make it a little bit easier.

   Brenda is a small animal veterinarian, mostly dealing with dogs and
   cats, and owns an equestrian facility. “I have been a veterinarian for
   24 years, and I grew up in a vet clinic as my dad was a vet as well,”
   she told Bored Panda.

   Usually, she carries out one or two euthanasias every week. “I [also]
   have had the rare occasion where there are 3-4 in one day and that is
   really hard on me and my staff.” After these experiences, Brenda tries
   to make sure she gets some alone time – vacations, time with family
   (who are really supportive of what she does).

   “The thoughts I’ve shared in my Facebook post have been on my mind for
   awhile, but that night they just came out – I sat down and wrote them
   in under five minutes – the words just flowed, real and raw and
   unplugged.”

   “I honestly didn’t mean to cause so many people to ugly cry,” Brenda
   added. “It wasn’t my intent to have this go viral – it clearly struck a
   chord with people all over the world. I have had kind messages from New
   Zealand, Texas, British Columbia, to name just a few places far far
   away that it has reached. I am just a vet in Brantford, Ontario.”

   She also pointed out that suicide rates are extremely high among
   veterinarians and veterinary caregivers. “It is my sincerest hopes that
   veterinarians everywhere will read the incredibly positive comments
   (there are over 25,000!) and know that they are loved, needed, and very
   much respected. If reading those comments will save even one life, then
   it is worth it.”

   ____________________

   As difficult as this topic is, it has a brighter side. Every year, 6.5
   million animals enter U.S. animal shelters – 3.3 million dogs and 3.2
   million cats. Also, 1.5 million shelter animals are euthanized every
   year (670,000 dogs and 860,000 cats). And even though this number can
   seem shockingly high, it actually has been declining. For example, back
   in 2012, the total figure was 2.6 million while in 2009, it was 3.7
   million. During the 1970s, the number of cats and dogs euthanized in
   the U.S. stood even higher – at over 20 million.

   Since then, large-scale activism, industry professionalization and
   shifting cultural attitudes have helped limit euthanasia, The New York
   Times said. “Society is no longer willing to say, ‘Well, there’s just
   too many animals and not enough homes,” Richard Avanzino, a longtime
   activist known as the father of the “no-kill” movement, stated.

   “Rescuing an animal has become a badge of honor,” said Matt Bershadker,
   the president and chief executive of the American Society for the
   Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. “People proudly go to dog parks and
   walk around their neighborhoods talking about the animal that they
   rescued from a shelter.”

Here’s how people reacted to the emotional post

   please people, be in the room when your beloved animal goes. you are
   who they look for because they know something bad is about to happen.
   the vets are always super emotional as well and will blubber with you,
   but I think its super important your pet knows you were there until the
   end <3

   I really wanted to hold my last one when she went but we got her as a
   rescue at 7 and she was so damaged that she always had to be wrapped in
   a towel at the vets because she lashed out. But she trusted me
   implicitly (because she could claw and bite me and I wouldn't
   retaliate, I would always love her and not judge) but the look she gave
   me when she went still haunts me, it was pure terror and just "rescue
   me". I couldn't do that again, clawing or not, I'd need to hold them
   when they went and I really wish I had then but the vet wouldn't let
   me.

   Never leave, as hard as it is, stay. The vet I use has a little room
   that you can stay with your pet for a while afterwards. I didn't leave
   for over an hour after I let my girl go this summer. It helped. I hope
   others have access to this.

   That's difficult for some people because they get very enotional and
   most animal's instincts are to comfort someone in distress. If they are
   unable to do so, it stresses them out and it's a vicious circle.
   Sometimes it's better to wait outside and let the vet do it. I have
   been with all my animals but I respect an owners decison not to be
   their, unless it's for selfish reasons (an unemotional owner who sees
   it a 'just a dog')

   What matters most is that the devotion they have given is reciprocated
   at their last moments. They need to know the ones they love are there.
   Who'd want to die surrounded by strangers?

   I could never be a vet, so much heartbreak. I held my beautiful dog
   'Bubbles' when she was put to sleep and it was the most heartbreaking
   thing I have ever had to do. I didn't want to let her go but she had an
   aggressive cancer that was starting to constrict her breathing. This
   was over 5 years ago and I still miss her dearly.

The Age At Which Young People Leave Their Parents’ Home Is Surprisingly
Different In Different Countries

   [JGrinevicius__30.jpg]
   [46684418_2015680828471390_5874373121749811200_n__30.jpg] Jonas
   Grinevičius and

   It’s a tearful but joyous moment when your baby birds (your children)
   finally fly out of the nest, move out of the family home, and start
   making it on their own. Or rather, it would be a tearful but joyous
   moment if it actually happened.

   The reality is, however, that history appears to be repeating itself.
   In the West — Europe, the United States, Australia, etc. — more and
   more youngsters choose to live with their parents and move out of their
   family homes far later than usual. Just like in the days of yore. Bored
   Panda reached out to Andrea Breen, an Associate Professor at the
   Department of Family Relations and Applied Nutrition at the University
   of Guelph, about the phenomenon, so scroll down to read the full
   interview.

   According to Breen from the University of Guelph, “economic necessity
   is a key reason” why kids live with their parents for longer. “More and
   more families need to combine incomes in order to afford basic
   necessitates, including housing, food, healthcare, and access to
   education. Economic necessity is driving young adults to stay in (or
   return to) their parents’ homes and it is also an important factor in
   many older adults moving in with their adult children (also an
   important related trend).”

More and more young people in the West choose to live with their parents
instead of moving out

Among the European countries where most ‘youngsters’ stay with their moms and
dads the longest are Montenegro, Croatia, Slovakia, and Italy

   According to Eurostat’s 2018 data, the average age across the European
   Union when young people leave their parents’ homes is more than 25
   years old. In 2017, Eurostat showed that 35.3 percent of 25 to
   34-year-old men were still living at home, compared to 21.7 percent of
   women of the same age group. The smallest percentage of young people
   living with their parents was found in Denmark (3.2 percent), Finland
   (4.7 percent), and Sweden (6 percent). While the highest was in Croatia
   (59.7 percent), Slovakia (57 percent), and Greece (56.3 percent).

   Meanwhile, Statista’s 2018 data shows that the average age when
   ‘youngsters’ from Montenegro left their family homes was 32.8.
   Croatians are in second place with an average age of 31.8; Slovakians
   are third with 30.9; Italians come right after that with 30.1.

   “Another key reason is family caregiving needs,” Breen explained why
   young people live with their parents for longer. “Young people in
   Canada, Australia, the US, Britain (and in other parts of the world)
   are actively engaged in providing daily care for family members
   (including siblings, parents, grandparents, and other family members).”

   “Family members are struggling to fill the gaps in healthcare and
   social welfare systems that do not provide adequate care and support
   for people with chronic illness, disabilities, mental health struggles,
   and substance abuse disorders. This is particularly important as
   populations age. Much of the care for grandparents is now provided by
   grandchildren, whose contributions to family life may be financial and
   may also involve caregiving and other forms of household labor.”

   “And a third reason is culture. Individualistic notions of people
   growing up and “going out on their own” are not the norm in many
   cultures, which emphasize that elders should be looked after by family
   members and that family well-being is a collective responsibility. This
   is challenging individualistic notions that the ultimate aim of adult
   life is to be independent and able to “go it alone”. Immigration trends
   and movements to recognize and value Indigenous cultures (in Canada,
   the US, and Australia) are also pieces of this puzzle.”

Europeans end up living in their family homes longer, just like decades ago

   Breen went on to analyze whether living at one’s parents’ home has
   positive or negative effects: “It really depends on the family.”

   “Recently I did some interviews with CBC Canada after news that an
   upstate NY couple won a lawsuit to kick their 30-year-old son out of
   the house. Obviously, that seems like an extreme example of family
   conflict related to an (adult) child living with his parents too long.
   While the headline is an attention-grabber, the reality is that we do
   not know what that family may have been struggling with behind the
   scenes (e.g. mental health issues? addiction?).”

   “It is important to highlight that the trend of extended families
   living together is in part a symptom of the terrible financial
   struggles that many families face. Many people have no choice but to
   live with their parents (or their adult children) in order to make ends
   meet. On the other hand, for some families, these changes might also
   create opportunities for stronger connections to family and culture and
   benefits to mental health and well-being.”

   Nobody’s judging the people still living with their parents, but by the
   age that they do move out, those individuals are less like baby birds
   and more like the gigantic harpy eagles that live in rainforests.

   The Guardian writes that the thinktank Civitas found that the number of
   young people who opt to live with their parents has grown incredibly
   over the last 20+ years. In 1997, 19.48 percent of young Brits (20 to
   34 years old) lived with their parents; by 2017, the number was 25.91
   percent.

The situation is similar in the United States

   The same is true ‘across the pond,’ in the United States. For example,
   NBC reports that according to the data that Census collected 1 in 4
   Californians between 25 and 33 years of age are still living with their
   mother and father. Things are no different in Australia, where 43
   percent of 20 to 24-year olds haven’t moved out yet, compared to 36
   percent back in 1981.

   There are serious reasons for this phenomenon, and it’s not just the
   ‘youngsters’ who have to shoulder the blame. The fact is, financial
   stability and property affordability both have a lot to do with the
   decision whether to stay with mom and dad or to fly out of the nest.

The reasons for staying with your parents can be financial, but there are
others as well

   According to The Economist, Brits have it bad: house prices have
   doubled over the last two decades, and a 27-year-old today is thus half
   as likely to become a home-owner than 15 years ago. The fact of the
   matter is, buying a house was far cheaper a generation ago. And even
   cheaper the further back you go.

   Curbed writes that in the United States, in 1959, a teacher would make
   5,200 dollars a year, while an average house in California cost 12,788
   dollars. That’s an income of 44,493 dollars and a house price of
   109,419 dollars when adjusted for today’s dollars. Nowadays, teachers
   living in San Francisco earn a median salary of 72,340 dollars, but
   buying a home in the city costs 1.61 million dollars.

   There are other reasons why young people are moving out later in life,
   such as getting into serious relationships later and later in life,
   which means they’re likely to move out later as well. Focusing on
   careers and being able to postpone starting a family may have something
   to do with that. However, another possible explanation could be a
   change in values, resulting in young people caring more about their
   families than before.

This is how people reacted to young adults moving out of their parents’ homes
later in life

   There's definitely a cultural component too, i'm from south Italy and
   in the process to leave home at the age of 28, both my parents and
   grandparents are confused by my choice because usually we leave home
   only when we marry and if the parents house is big enough not even
   then.

   Brazil is almost the same (we're practically Italians in São Paulo!),
   but the main reason is to end education first, THEN move out. But the
   economy, OH THE ECONOMY! - I've left with 23.

   I know a few people that still live with their parents and it isn't by
   choice. Unfortunately under our current financial climate, lack of
   affordable rentals, high unemployment rates and difficult housing
   market doesn't make it a choice for most people staying at home longer.
   I moved out at 18 but had to move back in with my parents at 21 with my
   partner and young daughter for about a year because of issues finding
   an affordable rental after the landlords wouldn't renew the lease
   because they had family that they wanted to move in. In many countries
   it is completely normal for families to live under the same roof as
   each other all their lives. Whatever works for some families obviously
   don't work for others.

   The whole "get out from your parents home" started as a real estate
   campaign in the 60's. Before that, several generation living under the
   same roof and helping each other out was the norm (mind you it didn't
   mean you were an unmaried, unemployed manchild who played video games
   24/7). Well, now we have a lot of old people complaining that their
   kids aren't there to help them.

   We found the perfect way of living together. Both my mom and I owned an
   apartment in the same building. She helped out with my kids (a lot) and
   I was closeby when she was ill and needed help. And because we had our
   own homes we could come by whenever we wanted without feeling we were
   in each other's space too much. We did have our own lives. Sadly she
   passed away this year, but I can recommend it to anyone who has a
   healthy relationship with their parents.

   I live in Australia. There are over 700,000 people unemployed and only
   around 200,000-250,000 jobs available and there are over 100,000 people

   Just by a quick look on the map of the US I'd say it's pretty obvious -
   young people stay the longest with their parents in the most expensive
   states that with the biggest population density (California, around NYC
   and Washington, Florida...) while the less populated states where its
   much cheaper to live are clearly easier for young people to leave a
   nest. It's the same where I live (Prague, Czech Republic). It's not an
   easy task, learning to stand on your own feet. I'd say it says more
   about the countries and their political/social systems than the young
   people.

   Yep pretty much. It's not uncommon for an entire family to live with
   their parents here in Southern California.

   There's definitely a cultural component too, i'm from south Italy and
   in the process to leave home at the age of 28, both my parents and
   grandparents are confused by my choice because usually we leave home
   only when we marry and if the parents house is big enough not even
   then.

   Brazil is almost the same (we're practically Italians in São Paulo!),
   but the main reason is to end education first, THEN move out. But the
   economy, OH THE ECONOMY! - I've left with 23.

   I know a few people that still live with their parents and it isn't by
   choice. Unfortunately under our current financial climate, lack of
   affordable rentals, high unemployment rates and difficult housing
   market doesn't make it a choice for most people staying at home longer.
   I moved out at 18 but had to move back in with my parents at 21 with my
   partner and young daughter for about a year because of issues finding
   an affordable rental after the landlords wouldn't renew the lease
   because they had family that they wanted to move in. In many countries
   it is completely normal for families to live under the same roof as
   each other all their lives. Whatever works for some families obviously
   don't work for others.

   The whole "get out from your parents home" started as a real estate
   campaign in the 60's. Before that, several generation living under the
   same roof and helping each other out was the norm (mind you it didn't
   mean you were an unmaried, unemployed manchild who played video games
   24/7). Well, now we have a lot of old people complaining that their
   kids aren't there to help them.

   We found the perfect way of living together. Both my mom and I owned an
   apartment in the same building. She helped out with my kids (a lot) and
   I was closeby when she was ill and needed help. And because we had our
   own homes we could come by whenever we wanted without feeling we were
   in each other's space too much. We did have our own lives. Sadly she
   passed away this year, but I can recommend it to anyone who has a
   healthy relationship with their parents.

   I live in Australia. There are over 700,000 people unemployed and only
   around 200,000-250,000 jobs available and there are over 100,000 people
   who are homeless.

   Random acts of kindness can restore anyone's faith in humanity. Makes
   sense, doesn't it? 'Cause when you think about it, the easiest thing to
   do when nobody is expecting anything from you is to continue minding
   your own business. And we people really like easy. However, every once
   in a while, someone breaks the status quo, offering help to a person
   who needs it the most.

   Recently, a wholesome story went viral on Reddit when someone shared
   what happened to them decades ago. Basically, a stranger "became" their
   parent for the moment, providing them with much needed financial help.
   After shedding a few tears, people started replying to it with their
   own similar experiences. Now, the post on r/HumansBeingBros has over
   117k upvotes and 1.3k comments, restoring faith in humanity with nearly
   every single one of them.

   This was me as a kid. My mother was mentally ill, and I lived in a very
   poor, very abusive household. My mother woukd allow me to go to
   parties, but much like school, I would arrive dirty and empty handed. I
   was never prepared for anything...I had no one responsible to take care
   of things like that. There was one particular party for a disabled girl
   in my class. She was wheelchair bound, and very sweet. Her mother gave
   me a gift to pretend was my own at the party. She then called my mother
   to ask if I could stay for a "sleepover". There was no sleepover
   planned.. It was just me. She bathed me, gave me new clothes and shoes,
   fed me, and showed me what a Mommy was supposed to be. She let me
   cuddle with her and watch movies. I didnt get a lot of physical contact
   at home of that nature. After the first night, she invited my sister to
   stay the next night as well. She did the same kindnesses for my sister
   and then took us to the park for a photo shoot,(she was a
   photographer). I still have those pictures, and I keep them up in my
   bedroom to remind me. I am that Mom now...to whomever I can get my
   hands on. I have 3 kids of my own and I always say "no gifts" for
   parties. I have had many kids stay at my house, and I always think of
   that angel that gave me hugs when I needed it the most...and I return
   those hugs to anyone who needs them. Thanks Chrissy's Mom.

   By the official poverty measure, there were about 40M poor Americans in
   2017, or 12% of the population. According to The Economist, America
   also does a worse job than its peers of helping the needy. "The
   official measure of poverty in America is inherently flawed," the
   magazine wrote. "It does not take cost of living into account, nor does
   it include benefits, meaning that the poverty-reducing effects of the
   earned-income tax credit or food stamps is ignored. The nature of
   poverty has also changed: in recent years, it has moved from cities to
   the suburbs."

   When i was 9 years old, my primary school, my teacher and class,
   planned a "bring your own food" lunch. This meant that you were
   supposed to bring snacks, soda drinks, or even your own recipes. I
   didn't explain it properly to my mom, so she said "take this half empty
   bag of chips", which is completely unnaceptable to take anywhere, for
   obvious reasons. I brought to my class with a "One Punch Man face" of
   complete lack of understanding of how ridiculous i looked, and how
   humillianting and poor my family made me look like. My mom didn't try
   to make me look bad, nor she is a bad person, she just thought i was
   going somewhere with my friends and might have thought i wanted to eat
   something. I showed half a bag of chips to my teacher, she freaked out
   and told me to leave the room because if i had no food i couldn't
   participate. (Where the f#%k am i supposed to go now). I was the only
   one to leave the room and sat near a big wall outside of the building
   facing towards the school's gate, still inside the school perimeters.
   Then this random woman (probably a visitor to the school or something)
   came in the school, talked with me and i told her what happened. She
   just got up, said "I'l be right back", came back and gave me a plastic
   bag full, with at least 5 different chip brands (Lays,Cheetos,Ruffles,
   Doritos and Pringles). I had no idea what was happening, i didn't know
   her, and i was a total NPC just saying yes and following her around.
   She took me back to my class AND PRETENDED TO BE MY AUNT WHO LEFT WORK
   TO HELP ME, SHE LIED TO MY TEACHER. To this day, i wonder who that lady
   was! That is the weirdest most beautiful moment of my life.

   I would have lied too...and I would have reported the teacher to the
   principal for what basically amounts to discrimination.

   Sadly, children are the likeliest age group to experience the effects
   of poverty—there are nearly 13M impoverished children currently living
   in America. So, while there isn't a new war on poverty in sight,
   efforts like these help when individual people take action and provide
   the hope some people desperately need.

   My mom was that kind of mom. To this day, she has friends of mine that
   I grew up with that call her on Mother’s Day.
   One of my friends lived with us for his entire senior year because his
   mother couldn’t deal with him being gay. He was suddenly failing school
   because he was just getting yelled at from the second he got home, and
   he couldn’t concentrate. My mom gave him a place to stay, and worked
   hard getting him into college. He’s doing very well now. He calls my
   mother “mom”, and calls his birth mother “Linda”.

   I grew up in a home where no one would buy food for fear the other one
   would eat it. No toilet paper for the same reason. Afraid the other
   parent would use it. They eventually got divorced. But while living
   there, an elderly couple lived next door. I remember the old lady
   giving me PB&J sandwiches over the fence. She hand made clothes for my
   Barbie dolls.. I loved animals . When her poodle has puppies, she let
   me into her house to pet and play with them every day. This was over 50
   years ago. I've never forgotten her kindness.

   There was a poor immigrant boy at my high school with a horrible cleft
   palate. He was teased constantly. One day my Mom picked me up and saw
   the boy. She asked me about him and I gave her some brief answers.
   My mother contacted the school and got the parents information. They
   spoke no English, and so were too intimidated/scared to take him in for
   government supported health care. She walked them through the entire
   process over a few weeks.
   He was gone for a week and returned to school looking very different.
   Remembering my mother's interest in him, I came home and told her "hey,
   that boy got surgery" Only then did I find out what she'd been up to
   for the last few weeks.
   Caring mothers ftw.

   This is wonderful. I grew up poor and in fifth grade there was a gift
   exchange. I privately asked the teacher if I could not participate
   because I couldn’t afford a gift for another child. Of course I knew I
   wouldn’t receive a gift either. When the gift exchange came, to my
   surprise my name was called. My teacher had bought a few small gifts
   for me so I wouldn’t be excluded. I’ve never forgotten that act of
   generosity.

   I came into their house sobbing because my mom was being horrible in
   the car on the drive over. She wa pissed at me for asking for a ride
   over. Was going on and on about how I couldn't make friends whose
   parents picked me up. Jennifer's mom was great. Made me feel welcome
   and comforted me without ever saying one bad thing to me about my
   mother. That night she came down to say goodnight. She kissed her
   daughter and told her good night and that she loved her. Then, sh*t I'm
   crying writing this, she did the same to me. My parents not once kissed
   me or told me that they loved me. That is till the night my mother lay
   dying. It was just her and me in the hospital. She finally told me that
   she loved me. It was too late. I told her that I didn't believe her.

   My parents never told me or my brothers they love us (they are great
   parents, the best, but they just never told us this) and I never
   understood why they could never tell us they loved us. I tell my kids I
   love them every day, because I want them to hear from their mother what
   I never heard from mine.

   Had a pretty tough growing up too. Around 6th grade went from having
   plenty to living in a studio apartment with my mom. Had 2 pairs of
   clothes to start a new school with. Moved 2 more times after that.
   Moved to nicer area in last one and made great friends whose parents
   didn’t judge when they heard about the things that had happened. When I
   graduated my family had no plans for party or anything. Hell my dad
   left right at end of ceremony because my brother was bored and they
   lived 3 hours away. I went to one of my best friends grad parties and
   his parents pulled me off to the side. His mom, step dad, and brothers
   had cake congrats on it for me. That family was amazing to me. They
   later took me in when I didn’t have place to live. And most thankful
   for them helping me leave the area we lived in. They were moving to
   another state and asked if I wanted to move with them. That was best
   decision I ever had. I truly believe if I stayed where I was my life
   would have just got worse.

   When i was growing up we had close to nothing. Then came another
   sibling like it wasn't bad enough that 1 couldn't be supported now add
   on one more kid. I didn't like going to school because of the language
   barrier and kids are assholes, i didn't like people for what i had to
   endure from a very young age. Anyway i use to force myself to go to
   school so i can collect lunch from those that didn't eat it, i would
   ask for their left overs and put all that food in my backpack so i can
   go home after lunch and feed my sibling and myself. A lunch lady took
   notice after a few months and one day she had a care package for me and
   asked me why i would dig in the trash for food sometimes. I broke down
   and explained that we didn't have food to eat sometimes and we
   sometimes had nothing to eat. I told her that and from that day forward
   she would take me home after school with a box of food for a week. She
   also gave my mom info on how to get help and free food when needed. She
   became my angel sort of speak. Also had my 1st Christmas that same year
   and now when i notice a kid struggling i just give them what i have
   even if i don't have anything for myself. That lady changed my whole
   life and I'm really grateful that she did that. I think of how i would
   have ended up if she hadn't done that for me and my family as a kid and
   the options where pretty much just jail. Now i have my own kids and
   family and even if bbn i don't eat i make sure my family has what they
   need and mostly what they want. Yet we still help others in need when
   we can. Those things do have a great impact on a person for sure.

   Our house always had the door open. My parents always welcomed people
   to join meals or just stop by.
   My best friend never had a good relationship with her dad. Throughout
   high school my parents would invite her to stay for dinner or to stay
   the night so that she didn’t have to go home. Another friend’s parents
   kicked him out because his stepdad was a dick. He ended up living with
   us our whole senior year. Yet another friend got caught with pot at
   school. When my parents found out they had her come over, sat her down,
   and gave her a come to Jesus talk. She was shocked because her own
   parents didn’t care.
   Even after high school my parents did these things. A married couple I
   was friends with hit hard times. My parents let them move in and live
   with them for a year. I moved out 4 months before my friends did. I’d
   come home to visit after I moved away and would always bring friends.
   They were always welcomed with a hug.
   I’m now 35 and they haven’t changed at all. Every Sunday they have
   family dinner. They invite friends, people from their church, and
   neighbors every week. Even my friends have standing invitations.
   Easter, Thanksgiving, and Christmas are always big feasts and everyone
   is invited. We typically have at least 2 non-relatives at holiday
   dinners in addition to whatever family is visiting.
   I strive to be as good of a person as my parents and to teach my kids
   the same. I will help people with food, clothes, money (if I have it),
   transport, or a place to sleep. If I can help, I do. My 9 yr old
   daughter really loves to help and share, so I know it’s sinking in
   somewhere.

   Grew up the same, never had special clothes or gifts for friends
   parties/bat mitzvahs/etc. When I was in 6/7th grade a friends mother
   took me out the day before our grade groups dance and let me buy
   anything I wanted from Macy's. I had just moved to the US, a very rich
   area, from the EU in a low income area. I got the least expensive dress
   in my size I could find, planning to pay most or all of it out of my
   own pocket, when the mother said "its easier to pay all on one (her)
   card". I said thank you and offered to pay for our dinner but she said
   no again. This continued for two years. The next morning before she
   left she gave me tights, shoes etc that I hadn't thought of. Thing's
   I'd only ever owned second or third hand. At the time I didn't realise
   she knew my family were broke. Its 10ish years later and I still think
   of her every time I buy something lavish. She never made it obvious to
   my friend that I was broke. Never made me feel ashamed or pittied. I
   keep in touch with both her kids, though we have gone different paths,
   I dont think they know how much their mother fed, clothed, and homed me
   for several years. To this day she checks up on me. It was the kindest
   thing a stranger with no motive has ever done for me.

   Ditto! For a couple of months we lived on this old apartment building
   in the ghetto part of town. Everybody was new to the country and/or
   dirt poor. It so happened it was my birthday during the couple months
   and my mum was throwing a small party for me and our neighbors kids. I
   didn't really expect any presents or anything. Then my best friend in
   that group realized that I didn't get presents so she went home and
   grabbed her favorite teddy (though it's actually a frog) for me.
   Seriously meant so much to me and 20 years later, I still have it. One
   of my favourite childhood memories though we've long lost touch.

   I was poor growing up as well, i was good friends with my neighbors,
   they had 2 sons that were brothers, one brother , he was same age and
   we went to same middle school. His older bro was cool with me too, he
   was 3-4 years older , so we all would hang out and play outside and
   different videogames.
   I didn't think i was very poor but i was. Maybe my parents raised me to
   a point where i thought we were ok. Then i realized how my neighbors
   had so much with little struggles, unlike my parents. I wouldn't think
   much about it, but hanging around so much, i saw it.
   On a Black friday morning, my friend came early to my house and invited
   me to play video games, he had all the good ones too.
   His mother was like " Hey, want to come shopping with us?" I didn't say
   much , " I can't, i dont have money and my parents would not buy me
   stuff i dont' really need, thanks." She convinced me to go with them
   for breakfast, then off to the outlets we went for the hot sales. I
   didn't have a dollar to my name, i was maybe 14-15 yrs old.
   She bought me new Puma shoes, couple of Levi's pants and i was in
   disbelief as we got home. I thanked her and said i'm not sure why she
   bought me these things.
   She sat me down , told me that i'm a real friend with nothing to hide .
   She said everybody needs help one way or another. She told me of kids
   in school bullied her younger son, name calling, hitting, just aweful
   things. I kind of knew this to a smaller level, he rode in a small bus,
   he had a hard time reading, i knew he had secial classes, it never
   mattered to me. We were close because of living next to each other, not
   sharing classes nor hanging out in lunch times.
   She told me of evil things i was not aware of. She said how her son
   really loves playing with me, how i defused one situation when another
   dude was trying to hit him, talks of me all the time. He mentioned to
   her that my shoes were over a year old
   and in school, i used same pants for like four days straight at times.
   She thanked me for being a real friend to her son.
   I'm 36 now, 'till this very day, every holiday, i remember her and what
   she did for me. It literally changed me.
   I call my friend and say hello to all his fam at least twice a year. I
   help others in need when i can help.
   I'll get a couple coats for the homeless, buy food for them when i see
   them hanging around the store i buy from. Heck, i'll even feed their
   homeless dogs. People sometimes do need help in one way or another.

   Holy sh*t I just helped my mom with something similar recently. We live
   in the Deep South, so poor kids usually don’t have heavy coats for when
   it drops below 40 a dozen days a year. Instead of handing coats to the
   poor kids and making them insecure, my mom hosts a fashion show at her
   school for coats where the kids get to keep them after. I spent my
   whole day last Monday as a judge for the fashion show where a bunch of
   poor kids got to pretend they were rich models for a day, and got a
   winter coat out of it. I swear my mom could find a way to make kids
   feel good about receiving any charity.

   My mom passed away when I was eleven so it was my dad taking care of
   myself and two brothers. This was during the recession and he worked
   construction so we were poor growing up while he was often laid off.
   When I turned 17, I got offered a job at Victoria's Secret and was so
   excited but they had their "all black" dress code and I did not have
   the wardrobe for it at all. One of my close friends at the time
   mentioned something to her mom and she picked me up one day to take me
   to lunch and spent a couple hundred bucks on a new work wardrobe for
   me.
   I always had plenty of support from my friend's moms since we all grew
   up together but this one always sticks out to me. I just hope I showed
   her how truly grateful I was that day.

   This reminded me of the story I read here about a mom always making two
   sandwiches for lunch for her son. He would give one sandwich to his
   best friend since they always ate together. Only when he grew up he
   found out that his mom knew his best friend's parents were druggies or
   something, and that probably was the only good meal he got all day.

   In 8th grade my whole class was going for a graduation trip and we had
   to fill out that trip consent form. My teacher pulled me to the side
   and asked me why I hadn't turned mine in. I told him I didn't have the
   money. The next day I got called into the principal's office and was
   told that I would get to go on the trip.

   my school had a fund for students who couldnt afford the fees for class
   trips or graduation trips. They raised the money, and if a parent was
   too poor, they called the school and the principal signed off on it and
   the kid was none the wiser. Everyone got to go, no one felt left out.
   Though I later discovered the once a year fundraiser where we students
   went door to door selling things for the school, this is where that
   money went.

   My mum runs a food business where she makes use of a lot of female
   immigrant workers, she ensures that she personally sets up all of their
   kids up to school and GPs and hospitals and usually throws big birthday
   parties for the mothers where all their kids are invited. My mums
   incredibly caring and has that big heart that almost all mothers have,
   I really appreciate what she does, especially since I’ve grown older.

   When I was a kid the other moms in the class bought me shoes every time
   I needed them. They said they were left over or unneeded but I realized
   as an adult that all the kids in the class likely didn’t have my same
   shoe size and they always fit well.

   I’m by no means rich but I’m not hurting either. My best friend is a
   single mom with several kids. She does her best for the kids. But they
   need a lot of attention and she has no family support. I always make
   sure they have things. I took them back to school shopping, I’ve taken
   each of the kids out for their birthdays. I made sure they got to go
   vacation this last year. I have a cousin in a similar situation,
   divorced with several kids. But her kids are spoiled rotten and she
   doesn’t pay a lot of attention to them. Ive gotten them things
   occasionally and they never appreciated the gift and trashed it almost
   immediately. So screw family. My friends kids always say thank you. But
   what broke my heart and made me dedicate to taking care of them was
   when i had promised them (friends kids and mine) that we would go out
   and for whatever reason we didnt get to. One of her sons, when i said
   ill take you another day, looked broken then said “promise?” My heart
   broke. I realized that his dad always promises the world and then
   nothing, cant even be bothered to visit. That moment i was like I will
   be there for this kid. I will show him and his siblings good people
   exist

   I realize now something my mom did for a friend I had in second grade.
   He lived a few blocks over, with his dad raising him as a single
   parent. His clothes were outgrown, he was always too skinny, not really
   clean, all that.
   The times he came over he would eat. I mean EAT. And not take the hint
   when it was time to leave. My mom picked up on it, and would try to
   have a Tupperware packed with leftovers when it was time to go.
   I used to think she was just an over zealous Midwest mom, but as an
   adult I know she was trying to make sure my friend could eat home
   cooked food every week.

   I can't really remember, I was too young. But we grew up poor also.
   My oldest sister didn't get on the bus with myself and my other sister.
   Mom didn't know until we got home, and a teacher called and said Jackie
   (oldest) was safe and with her. They showed up about an hour later and
   Jackie came running through the door and showed mama her brand new
   shoes, and ran off to show Dana (other sister).
   Teacher came walking up and gave my Mom a pair of shoes. Jackie's old
   ones. All tore up with big holes in the soles and falling apart. Mom
   broke down and just bawled on this teacher's shoulder apparently. She
   said her kids would never wear anything like that again, took them and
   hung them on a nail in her closet. Still there, 24 years later. We
   never went without. The family was still poor, but we kids never knew
   it.
   Same teacher reached out to her church and let them know what was up.
   One day they just showed up out of the blue, whole congregation went
   grocery shopping for us. We apparently had more food than cabinets.
   There is still good people out there, just have to look for them.

   I grew up on the opposite end of this, parents were well off. At
   Christmas when we went shopping for gifts for my friends, my mom made
   me pick out extra presents (male and female) and give them to the
   poorest kid/quiet kid/bully to make sure every kid in the class felt
   like they had a friend and weren't left out. It was extremely
   embarrassing for me at the time, I hated it. Now, as an adult, I'm
   grateful that my mom made me do this every year. It taught me to
   recognize and be appreciative of others, and I think I became a much
   nicer overall person for it. I hope that those people are like you and
   look back at it fondly.

   I was poor growing up but I grew up in an area where everyone was poor
   (born in the 80s in a small town in Scotland) so my neighbourhood we
   all kind of pulled together.
   Unfortunately my dad was the local criminal/alcoholic, I can remember
   eavesdropping on my mum talking to her friend about how my teacher
   actually offered to babysit me and my sisters whilst my mum worked her
   night cleaning job when my dad was on one of his many stays in prison.
   I never really understood the significance until I was older.

   It’s so easy to judge someone instead of actually taking the time to
   make a difference.
   I just saw a story of a dad whose son was being bullied by a kid at
   school. Instead of getting mad at the bully, he got permission from his
   parents to talk to him. He ended up finding out that the kid was
   bullying people because he was being bullied for the clothes he wore
   because his parents weren’t well off. The dad bought the kid a bunch of
   a clothes and made the two boys talk it out. Now they’re friends!

   I grew up in a similar situation, it was the people like that mom that
   ignored where I lived, ignored my parent’s names in the police logs and
   treated me like a regular kid that made me realize I was not the
   situation I was in.

   My neighbor had four beautiful daughters with the same man. Her and the
   girls father never married, but the girls all had their father's last
   name. Unfortunately, it was a bit of a curse since their Grandfather
   was incarcerated for murder and their aunt was known for being the
   crazy lady in this small town. I had taken Law and Justice classes at
   the local college and so I was also friends with some of the officers
   of the local PD. One of them advised me to "stay away from the family"
   referring to my neighbor and her daughters. I looked straight at him
   and said "Why? They've done nothing wrong and they shouldn't be shunned
   because of a stupid mistake made by a relative that they rarely see."
   I'm no longer friends with that officer..but I'm still friends with my
   neighbors daughters.

   This is turning into a mum appreciation thread, so don't mind me
   joining in. Our house was always the "everyones welcome" house. There
   were 3 of us kids anyway, but every night we'd have 1-3 kids extra for
   dinner. Both my sister and I also had a friend who often felt unwelcome
   in their home and they stayed with us a lot. My sisters friend actually
   stayed with us for weeks. One of my friends once called me super late
   saying her mum had kicked her out and my mum had zero hesitation of
   letting her come stay with us until needed.
   Always been grateful for having such a fab and caring mum, but her
   generosity and caring nature towards so many other people is what makes
   her an actual great person in general. I'll def be having an open house
   policy for my kids and their friends too!

   So when i was younger i lived in China, my dad had to escape the
   country due to political persecution. My mom was laid off and lived on
   early "pension" they called it. We sometimes didn't have money for
   breakfast, and needed to feed me food.
   Now regardless you believe a god exist or not, i to this day still
   believe in divine intervention to good people:
   We would walk home sometimes (obviously my mom didn't tell me and i was
   too young to realize), we would find ten yuan or 5 yuan lying right at
   our front door. We didn't have a neighbour to the right of our hall so
   no one could have dropped their money accidently, so either it was the
   neighbour on our left or the money magically appeared outta nowhere.
   Everytime it was the exact amount to feed me at the breakfast market.
   I know it might be stupid to some of you guys to think that a divine
   being is doing it ,but in my mind God is real, and i am thankful for it
   everyday.

   I was that same poor kid growing up. My friends' mom always treated me
   like her own and would fix meals and snacks while i was there, even
   pack up food for me to take home, and on several occasions invited me
   over on thanksgiving and Christmas so that i could have something to
   eat. Often whenever i was there to play video games with my friend i
   hadnt eaten in days. Ill never forget my "mom" who was more of a mother
   to me than my birth mom. She not only fed me, but made me feel valued
   and for as long as i stayed over i felt at home.

   I grew up poor as well, didnt realize it untill about 6th grade. Used
   to go dumpster diving for fun as a kid while my mom would do lookout so
   we wouldn't get caught, and to me that would sometimes be the highlight
   of my day. My best friend at the time had some awesome parents, they
   knew of my situation the first time they took me home. That same summer
   they started letting me stay the night for a week at a time, only
   bringing me home to get new clothes or if they had something important
   that they couldn't bring me with them to. When they eventually moved
   away when i was in 3rd grade i realized how much time i spent with them
   and how much they had been doing for me.

   When I was in 8th grade, my home room/English teacher and I formed a
   special friendship. She knew my mom wasn’t in the picture. We had a
   formal dance and middle school graduation coming up, so she took me
   shopping. My dad gave me enough money to buy one dress, so my teacher
   paid for my formal dress. We went and ate pizza with her family after.

   Well, I know what I'm doing on my daughter's next birthday.
   She's very good friends with a refugee in our village - he's one of 6
   kids being taken care of by a single father. The boy is out later than
   everyone else, going from friend's house to friend's house looking for
   someone to play with and somewhere to get more attention than he does
   at home. Some days, we are busy with something else or my daughter
   doesn't want to play and it is a bit heartbreaking to send him away.
   He is a great and happy kid, well-behaved and creative. I never really
   thought about how he might be aware of what he doesn't have compared to
   everyone else, but I think this is a perfect way to help him to deal
   with that if it is an issue for him.

   I remember back when I was about 6, I had a birthday party with my
   friends and at some point during the party I was looking for one of my
   friend.
   I heard my dad speaking with my friend's family, so I went to my front
   yard, where I saw my dad give my friend 50$ to put inside a birthday
   card his family brought.
   To be honest I only realized the situation about 10 years later when I
   remembered it.
   I would have never thought about that my friend was poor. I remember my
   buddy being happy to give me the card, 50$ as a kid was a lot ! That
   was a cool move from my dad.

   I was not poor at all and lived in upper middle class white people
   land, but had the same thing happen to me at a birthday party. My mom
   was a bit detatched, and I grew up with my friends mother's as
   surrogates. One of my good friends, his mom used to pack him extra
   gushers in his lunch bag for me. Not only did she do this kindness for
   me, but my friend resisted eating them himself too!

   started high school with a new bike and Doc Martin shoes (they were in)
   for my school uniform. I know my mum couldn't afford them. Then in 4th
   form my mum said I could go on any of the outdoor trips as someone will
   pay for any trips I wanted to go on!!!!

   These are heartwarming and sad at the same time. I wish all these
   people all the best.

   My mother-in-law taught math at a high school where half the population
   were poor kids. She would watch the kids and recognize the ones that
   were thirsty for learning and wanted to change their situation. She
   would help them with extra tutoring after school, help them fill out
   college applications and student aid forms. She'd even pay the fees for
   them to be submitted. Many of those kids went onto successful careers
   and got out of those poor neighborhoods. The woman was selfless.

   I was part of a football team which went on tour in the summer
   holidays, one kid never came and it turned out it was because his
   family couldn't afford it, my Dad secretly paid for him to come along
   and also told him if he scored 3 goals on the tour he'd buy him a new
   pair of football boots. We reached the final and he scored 6 goals
   along the way and turned up in the new season with better boots than
   me. I only found out about this recently (18 years later) when he told
   me about my Dad's act of kindness. My Dad didn't have much money at all
   at the time. I have never and will never mention it to my Dad, but it
   always warms my heart to think about it.
