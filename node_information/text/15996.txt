7nm Process, Zen 2, and the X570 Chipset

TSMC 7nm Process

   AMD tapped TSMC's 7nm process for the Ryzen 3000 series processors.
   AMD's first-gen Ryzen processors debuted on GlobalFoundries' 14nm GPP
   node, but the 2000-series CPUs moved to GloFo's 12nm LP process
   technology. The ported-over design helped boost transistor performance,
   but did not affect die area or transistor density. As a result,
   Pinnacle Ridge's ~4.8 billion transistors and 213mm^2 area remained the
   same as first-gen Ryzen.

   In contrast, TSMC's 7nm process represents a true shrink that provides
   twice the transistor density. AMD says the process allowed it to shrink
   the CCX by 29% relative to the 12nm process, which helped pave the way
   for Zen 2's enhancements, like the doubled L3 cache capacity and the
   ability to double core counts within the same package dimensions. It's
   also important to note that the company also removed I/O and memory
   controllers from the compute chiplet this time around, resulting in
   even smaller packages.

   AMD also claims the process affords up to 350 more MHz of core
   frequency at the same voltage as the 12nm LP process. The new process
   also delivers on the energy efficiency front with up to 75% higher
   performance-per-watt compared to the 12nm LP process. AMD also says the
   7nm node produces up to 58% higher performance-per-watt than Intel's
   aging, but highly refined, 14nm++ process, but be aware that the Ryzen
   3000 chips still have a 12nm I/O die that contributes to the chip's
   overall power consumption.

   AMD says that the 15% increase in IPC throughput from the Zen 2
   microarchitecture serves up 60% of the performance improvements seen in
   the Ryzen 3000 series chips, with the remaining 40% coming from the 7nm
   process and frequency improvements.

Zen 2 Microarchitecture

   Zen's modular and scalable design provides AMD with plenty of
   advantages in terms of cost and time to market, and fine-grained tuning
   to the architecture has yielded phenomenal results.

   AMD has improved IPC by roughly 15% (though that can vary by workload),
   doubled the L3 cache size to keep data as close to the execution units
   as possible, and doubled floating point performance by expanding
   floating point bandwidth to 256-bit to improve performance with AVX2
   instructions.

   Headline improvements include a doubled micro-op (4K) and L3 cache
   (32MB), which came at the expense of a slightly smaller L1 instruction
   cache that is now an 8-way associative 32K block as opposed to the 64K
   block with 4-way associativity on first-gen Ryzen. AMD also beefed up
   the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) to 2,000 entries.

   AMD now has a double-stage branch predictor, with its Perceptron
   predictor handling the first stage while a new TAGE branch predictor,
   which features larger lookup tables to improve performance, serves as
   the second stage. That's paired with larger L1 and L2 branch target
   predictors (BTBs) that increase throughput by reducing stalls. AMD says
   the improved branch predictor expends extra energy on the front end,
   but the 30% lower misprediction rate ultimately saves more energy on
   the backend. A third address generation unit (AGU) also keeps the
   hungry execution cores fed with data from main memory.

Enter the X570 Chipset

   AMD's Ryzen 3000 series processors have dynamic algorithms that adjust
   parameters based upon several factors, with power delivery and heat
   dissipation being the chief variables that can unlock extra
   performance. As such, motherboard selection is going to be a big factor
   in the amount of performance you receive if you choose to use AMD's
   Precision Boost Overdrive (PBO - next page) and Auto Overclock
   features. The X570 motherboard ecosystem has proven to be pricey
   compared to the previous-gen X470 models, but AMD says that the Ryzen
   3000 series processors will operate at full performance at stock
   settings with X470 motherbaords. You just sacrifice access to the PCIe
   4.0 interface. Credit: AMD Credit: AMD

   The actual X570 chipset is a 14nm variant of the 12nm I/O die inside
   the Ryzen 3000-series processors, which is a clever reuse of the
   technology that ultimately lowers costs. This chipset is also fully
   produced by AMD, whereas the X470 chipset came from ASMedia, which says
   it will continue to produce some chipsets for Ryzen 3000 series
   processors. AMD uses the smaller 12nm process for the processor's
   in-package I/O die to leverage the increased frequency potential for
   the memory controllers. That improves memory data transfer rates, but
   AMD uses the more economical 14nm variant, which has its memory
   controllers disabled, for the chipset die. Credit: AMD Credit: AMD

   Most X570 motherboards come with a fan on the chipset to provide active
   cooling for the chipset, which now consumes ~11-15W compared to the 6W
   consumed by the X470 chipset. That's due to the power-hungry nature of
   the PCIe 4.0 interface when it is under full load. Small fans like
   these tend to be noisy, but our motherboard team is hard at work on the
   first wave of X570 motherboard reviews and will provide more
   perspective.

   Ryzen 3000-series chips are compatible with most previous-gen
   motherboards with the AM4 socket, but some updates are left to vendor
   discretion. As such, you won't be able to drop a new Third-gen Ryzen
   chip into all X370 and B350 motherboards, and A320's upgrade path is
   blocked entirely. Due to the uneven application of BIOS updates across
   the various vendors, and even among different motherboards in the
   respective product stacks, you'll have to check the CPU support list
   for your X370 or B350 motherboard to ensure it supports Third-gen
   Ryzen.

   There are plenty of X470 and B450 motherboards still on the market, but
   some of the boards that have been in the supply chain for a while will
   need a BIOS update before you install a Third-gen Ryzen processor.
   As we've seen in the past, that isn't always possible if you don't
   already have a Ryzen processor or if the motherboard doesn't have an
   out-of-band BIOS update feature, like BIOS Flashback. AMD also
   announced that all motherboards that support Ryzen 3000 processors out
   of the box will come with a new badge to help simplify things.

       too bad there wasn't a 3800X included, would be interesting to see
       if the price tag for the 3800X over the 3700X is indeed worth it

       Nice for worksation task, but disappointing it basically ties Intel
       in gaming if not just a tad behind.

       It tied to Intel for less money, with a great bundled cooler, and a
       cheaper platform (edit: and less power too). Also, unless you use a
       144Hz monitor, the diference is purely synthetic. Did you expect it
       to be way faster than a 5 GHz Intel magically?

       I can't imagine it would be.
       If looking at the 3800x as a binned 3700x - that's basically what
       it would be - grab one if it goes on sale closer to the 3700x's
       price.
       These chips don't overclock any better than their predecessors,
       which wasn't good to begin with, so whatever extra clocks you get
       with a 3800x will hardly be noticeable and won't be worth a $50+
       price increase over 3700x.

       The overclocking results were disappointing. 4.1Ghz max on all
       cores. Given that the 3950x does a 4.7Ghz single core turbo boost
       and the 3900x does 4.6Hz single core turbo boost. I'd have assumed
       any of the Ryzen 3000 would OC to 4.6/4.7Ghz on all cores with
       decent air/water cooling.
       Power consumption: AIDA 64 seems to punish AMD a lot more than
       Intel. When you were using Prime95 Intel was punished a lot more.
       It seems the switch from Prime95 to AIDA 64 gives Intel an unfair
       advantage in the stress test power consumption test. While Prime95
       gave AMD an unfair advantage. I'd suggest using both in reviews or
       find another torture test that will fully punish both AMD and Intel
       for a max load test. With such wild variation. I can't see how
       either is an accurate measure of a CPU under full load.
       Example Review:
       https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/intel-core-i9-9900k-9th-gen-cp
       u,5847-11.html
       The Intel i9-9900K hit 204.6W in your old reviews stress test. This
       time it is only 113W.
       The AMD Ryzen 2700x hit 104.7W in your old review. Now it is 133W.

     It tied to Intel for less money, with a great bundled cooler, and a
     cheaper platform (edit: and less power too). Also, unless you use a
     144Hz monitor, the diference is purely synthetic. Did you expect it
     to be way faster than a 5 GHz Intel magically?
       It did tie Intel in gaming. It tied basically the same Intel CPUs
       that have been on the market since 2015 with Skylake. We are in the
       back half of 2019 and we see the same gaming performance that we
       had in 2015 mainstream CPUs.
       We know AMD is cheaper and comparing clockspeeds against different
       architectures between Intel and AMD is silly. But it would be nice
       to see some tangible improvement regarding fps with CPUs. The GPU
       still remains king when it comes to a quality gaming build.

       I've seen reviews from 5 different sites and the conclusions bounce
       all over the place, which makes me think there is much to do on the
       software optimization side. :unsure: I was expecting gaming FPS to
       not change all that much with many of the titles being tested have
       partnered or optimized around Intel.

     Nice for worksation task, but disappointing it basically ties Intel
     in gaming if not just a tad behind.
       Minus the ability to overclock yes tied. Most people who buy the
       9900K will not be buying it to leave it stock.

     Quote:

     The overclocking results were disappointing. 4.1Ghz max on all
     cores. Given that the 3950x does a 4.7Ghz single core turbo boost
     and the 3900x does 4.6Hz single core turbo boost. I'd have assumed
     any of the Ryzen 3000 would OC to 4.6/4.7Ghz on all cores with
     decent air/water cooling. Power consumption: AIDA 64 seems to punish
     AMD a lot more than Intel. When you were using Prime95 Intel was
     punished a lot more. It seems the switch from Prime95 to AIDA 64

       Its what I wanted to know. Ryzen has always been pushed to the
       limit in terms of clock speed and Zen 2 is no different it seems.
       Little to no headroom. AnandTech was able to get it to 4.3GHz all
       core but with manual OCing it seems to disable boost clocking which
       in turn cuts 300MHz from single core performance.
       As for the power consumption, the differences are probably what
       they prioritize. I know Prime 95 heavily uses AVX which is a power
       hog. Not as sure on AIDA 64 since I never used it. I always use
       Prime 95 and IBT for stability.

       Its not silly to compare clock speeds as those can be advantages.
       Intel still clearly has a clock speed advantage and that advantage
       will keep them priced higher. We might see some drops but I doubt
       we will see enough to make it feel like Athlon 64 again.
       As much crap as people give Intel for getting stuck at 14nm I have
       to give them props for having a 5 year old process tech beat modern
       process tech, especially one that's supposed to be "half" the size.
       I know its not quite as most 7nms out there are still less dense
       than Intels initial 10nm plans but still it goes to show that the
       nm part has become pointless and a marketing gimmick more than
       anything.
       The only thing a CPU matters gaming wise is how long it will last
       before it will bottleneck the GPU. While its still early the clock
       speed and overclocking advantage Intel has might make their CPUs
       last longer in gaming than Zen 2. Only time will tell but maybe AMD
       will get a better process tech in a few years and finally compete
       like the old days.

       Unless you're trying to give an indication of "performance-per-MHz"

       differing architectures is a fundamentally invalid comparison (it's
       also not exactly an accurate predictor of per-core performance).

       Clockspeeds between AMD and Intel are not apples to apples.
       Bulldozer hit 5ghz and it was a terrible CPU. Just because it could
       hit 5ghz, did not make a good chip.

       Even real-world aren't reliable indicators unless you can find
       benchmarks of the specific software and task within that software
       you are interested in. Anything else is a general indicator at
       best.
       So, I predicted all-core overclocks on par with XFR boost at best
       and it seems Tom's review samples get nowhere near that on
       practical cooling. Looks like AMD is doing a pretty good job of
       leaving little to nothing for practical overclockers to do with the
       X-chips already squeezing everything they are worth out of
       themselves with little more than a few checkboxes.

       I think this Ryzen lineup is great and delivers awesome
       performance, especially in professional applications. Some people
       seem to be disappointed, that Ryzen 7/9 didn't beat their Intel
       counterparts in gaming, which was something a lot of
       people(myself included) didn't think was going to happen anyway.
       However, I do think that AMD could have been a bit more transparent
       and modest, when showcasing their own benchmarks of their products
       beating or matching the competing Intel chips, which would result
       in less people being let down.
       Other than that, I think AMD did great in both GPU and CPU
       department and look forward to more products from them.

       Good effort by AMD, but still doesn't move the performance bar any
       for home users. For anyone who has been waiting 4 years to get a
       5960x for less than $500, you've now got your CPU. For anyone
       looking for something tangibly faster than Intel's Haswell
       generation CPU's, you're still waiting.

       Zen 2 seems to have some 30% better power efficiency than Intel
       processors, and that's huge. Power efficiency is everything for
       SFF, laptops, HTPC, fanless builds etc etc. So I would say it can
       potentially move the performance bar a lot for those.
       Regarding absolute performance, the 12-core destroys all Haswell
       desktop CPUs in productivity, and I can't care less about "tangibly
       faster" in gaming as long as my graphics card is the bottleneck in
       1440p+.

       For the lower-power segments, Intel has Icelake which is more than
       a match for Zen 2 CPU-wise.

       About bad overclock numbers, my 2 cents:
       1. Nobody had the time to properly test them. I believe Tom's had
       like two or so days to run dozens of tests on two brand new
       processors, and still produce the article. Also, these are early
       BIOS and drivers. It could improve with time.
       2. The 3700x reaches a max of 4.3, but the 3950x reaches 4.6. Maybe
       it's inconsistent because of such a new process, after all, these
       are the first 7nm cpus produced, right? And lots of changes, some
       sillicon revisions could help a lot.

       A 12 core CPU will not be any faster than an 8 core for home users.
       The software used does not scale with that many cores. If it was so
       easy to make typical software scale with more cores, programmers
       would have already done it. Most mainstream software is not capable
       of being highly parallelized like a graphics workload, so this
       problem isn't going to get fixed without a completely different
       type of computing platform. Adding more cores doesn't make a PC
       faster when what you really need is faster cores.

       May want to watch this link from world reknown overclocker de8auer:
       [MEDIA=youtube]WXbCdGENp5I[/MEDIA]
       View: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXbCdGENp5I
       He has 10 CPU's (mix of 6/8/12 cores). Forget overclocking, he
       couldn't get any of his 8 or 12 core CPU's to hit AMD's advertised
       max clocks (4.5 for 3800x, 4.6 for 3900x) even with a custom water
       cooling loop. There were leaks before launch that these chips would
       hit 5GHz. De8auer says in this video to forget that, he has chips
       that wouldn't hit 5GHz using liquid nitrogen.

       Linus had a possible cause for this. He noted the same thing (with
       results all over the place) and realized it's a result of the
       windows scheduler bouncing heavy tasks from core to core without
       consideration for boost clocks. when they locked the application to
       the cores that were boosting the results for the AMD cpu shoot went
       up and became much more consistent. He believes once the scheduling
       issue in windows is worked out the Ryzen bench results will
       probably increase noticeably.

       One of these days you might actually understand what matters, and
       what doesn't. AMD delivered on performance that matters, not some
       silly gaming benchmark(s) that is Intel's last gasp as it hangs on
       by it's fingernails. Performance that you can only see if you
       couple either platform with a $1200 GPU no less, and even then, you
       can't actually notice a difference while playing your game (155fps
       vs 135 FPS, who gives a rats a**). Show me a game in which the
       Intel CPU is performing at a level that is visually noticeably
       better (without looking at some silly fps counter).
       On every other front, the Intel CPU gets stomped in the dirt, all
       while costing more and consuming more power, and needing an exotic
       cooling solution as well.
       Easy win for AMD, for anyone other than those only interested in
       nothing but pure fps bragging rights, which is so High School level
       silly.
       Spectre/meltdown/zombieload......disable HT, etc etc etc. Every
       month brings another Intel bug.
       They should be ashamed.

       So impressive. AMD hasn't been on my radar since the Athlon days.
       Competition is good! I wonder how long it'll take Intel to get to
       7NM. Also, where's Intel's response hardware-wise? I mean isn't the
       9900K almost a year old at this point? And it's still beating AMD
       in a lot of areas.

       You don't have to. Both are single threaded applications with
       random addons that may support multithreading, so you know Intel is
       going to win, just like most stuff from Adobe. People like Ncogneto
       don't seem to grasp how much commonly used software doesn't benefit
       at all from increased core counts beyond a few.

Performance Results: 2560 x 1440

   Given what we’ve already seen from GeForce RTX 2060 Super and 2070
   Super, both of AMD’s Radeon RX 5700-series cards are best suited to
   gaming at 2560 x 1440. They’re also beyond ample for 1920 x 1080,
   though we don’t think you need to spend $350 or $400 dollars for smooth
   frame rates at that resolution.

   Across our benchmark suite, Radeon RX 5700 XT averages 9.9%-higher
   frame rates than the GeForce RTX 2060 Super at 2560 x 1440. Radeon RX
   5700 averages 11%-higher frame rates than the GeForce RTX 2060 at the
   same resolution. The GeForce RTX 2070 Super does serve up average frame
   rates 6.9% higher than Radeon RX 5700 XT, but it costs 25% more.

   Compared to AMD’s previous generation, Radeon RX 5700 XT achieves
   15%-higher average frame rates than Radeon RX Vega 64 at a $100-lower
   launch price.

   Before any of the GeForce RTX Super cards were announced, AMD said it
   was targeting GeForce RTX 2070 with its Radeon RX 5700 XT. The top-end
   Navi card does deliver 6.4%-higher average frame rates than its
   intended GeForce mark, which means it often lands close to the
   venerable GeForce GTX 1080 Ti.

       I read the review, don't know what you mean by "let alone power
       consumption". Efficiency is virtually the same. I personally prefer
       blowers as long as they're not crazy loud, and the review says
       they're not so I'm all for it. If you DON'T like blowers, I'm sure
       there will be third-party coolers that improve cooling performance
       and acoustics further (and dump heat into the chassis like crazy).

       Who ever promised that? They are 10-11% faster than same-priced
       Nvidia models. They're not going to drop 5700 $100 bucks when
       they're already ahead by 11%, even though I would love lower
       prices, there's no incentive for them to do so.

       I'm pleasantly surprised by both the performance AND the
       last-minute drop in price. Personally I don't like blower style
       cards and will be on the lookout for third-party offerings with
       more traditional dual fan coolers. This is totally personal
       preference as I tend to build in bigger cases with plenty of
       ventilation to deal with the extra heat. If the prices don't get
       too out of line from the AIBs then I'll gladly give a few of these
       cards a go in upcoming builds. I'm also expecting a decent
       improvement in thermals so hopefully these FE cards aren't
       exemplary of the best cooling you can get on air. The prospect of
       building all AMD machines in the coming months has got me totally
       nerding out.

       You didn't read the review. Ignoring the Furmark results which
       don't mirror any realworld scenario. The 5700xt is slower than the
       2070 Super while using more power and running over 10degrees C
       hotter in gaming.

       Yes, I did, stop being obstinate. Ah, I get it, you must have read
       "efficiency" in my post as "power consumption", or something. Why
       are you comparing it to the 2070 Super? The 5700 is the same price
       as the 2060 and 11-12% faster on average (between TH and AT), and
       the 5700XT is the same price as the 2060 Super and roughly 10-11%
       (TH-AT) faster. Yes, they use more power, but they're faster. As a
       result the efficiency is pretty close. It varies based on workload
       (game title), but I have read the reviews here and AT (so far,
       haven't looked at a third review yet). Here:
       https://www.anandtech.com/show/14618/the-amd-radeon-rx-5700-xt-rx-5
       700-review/15
       Factor in the performance gain (in AT's suite it was 11% for the XT
       and 12 for vanilla 5700) and you'll see their power consumption is
       pretty good. Average that with TH's results in Metro: LL and the
       final efficiency is pretty neck and neck with their direct
       competitors.
       I didn't say they didn't run hot. For people that don't like
       blowers (as I already said) there will be cooler, quieter third
       party options.

     blowers as long as they're not crazy loud, and the review says
     they're not so I'm all for it. If you DON'T like blowers, I'm sure
     there will be third-party coolers that improve cooling performance
     and acoustics further (and dump heat into the chassis like crazy).
     Who ever promised that? They are 10-11% faster than same-priced
     Nvidia models. They're not going to drop 5700 $100 bucks when
     they're already ahead by 11%, even though I would love lower prices,
     there's no incentive for them to do so.
       In all honesty, all these cards are expensive. $350 would have been
       the most I wanted to pay for a 5700XT. And the card does run hot.
       Pascal was a small move up in prices. Turing was just insane
       pricing wise.
       That being said I bought one today and said "F"-it. I just don't
       like NVIDIA's business ethics. It will get the job done for two to
       three years.

       How many engineers looked at those fan curves in lab testing and
       thought they were good?
       I think this release is a bit underwhelming. Local pricing here
       makes the RX 5700 fairly unattractive compared to a 2060, but the
       XT is better positioned against the 2070. Not sure it's really
       worthwhile upgrading a 970 though.

       So for the many of us on a RX480?...
       Worth it? Could someone not dig out the previous AMD midrange value
       demon to test against? C'mon...

       The last $200 card AMD has released was 2.5 years ago. Let that

       On average the 5700XT is about twice as fast as the GTX 980 and the
       980 is 10-15% faster on average than the 970. That means that going
       to the XT will double your framerate assuming your CPU can keep up.
       I would say that is a worthwhile upgrade.

       I usually like to triple my framerates while sticking to a similar

       They ARE expensive - both Nvidia and AMD. This is the new
       "mid-range" unfortunately. I'd like to see Xe undercut them both
       and force this tier back down to the ~$250 range. I still might end
       up getting one, we'll see.

       If you're talking about the erratic behavior with the speed
       dropping over time, that looks to me like a bug or an issue with
       that sample. Their XT didn't act that way. Pricing can suck
       depending where you are... in the US it certainly offers more bang
       for the buck than the 2060. Maybe pricing will be more reasonable
       when partner boards become widespread. Like your icon, BTW, big fan
       of new Genesis/MD titles - awaiting Xeno Crisis currently.

       While not as bad, I wouldn't call the XT's fan curve good either.
       It's going to start roaring the moment you get to the main menu
       (and you'll probably notice the sudden change) and it won't stop
       until you're back at the desktop.

       Those performance numbers aren't very different than what TH is
       reporting. And values will obviously vary depending on your test
       suite. This review reflects the fact that these otherwise great
       value cards are paired with a mediocre blower cooler, it hardly
       says the cards "suck". Which amounts to saying that we should wait
       for AIB cards, which is pretty common advice for every GPU launch.

       While I was reading this article I was thinking "please please
       please let redgarl post in the forums!!" My wish was granted and
       Redgarl definitely provided.
       Redgarl describes this review as a "joke". He claims that Navi is
       "disrupting pricing" and "almost match a 1080 TI". He provides
       links to the TechSpot 5700 review for "anyone that want to know
       what matter..." This made me genuinely really curious. Is today the
       day that redgarl proves Tomshardware is run by a bunch of hacks? I
       had to know for myself.
       First of all I looked at the test setups for each review. Techspot
       uses a 9900K Intel CPU and 32GB DDR4-3200. Tomshardware's build is
       different. They use a 8086K Intel CPU and 64GB of DDR4 2400.
       Tomshardware documents the drivers used as 431.16 Nvidia Driver for
       the 2060Super and 2070Super but the 430.86 for every other Nvidia
       card. For AMD cards, they use the 19.7.1 driver with the RX 5700
       cards and the 19.6.3 driver for everything else. By comparison,
       Techspot reports that they used the "latest drivers available at
       the time". Its not clear how that compares to Tomshardware. The
       test machine on each respective site is different and that may
       cause differences in benchmarks. I predict (jk. I've already seen
       the results) the Tech Spot benchmarks may be a little higher
       judging by the faster memory and the better CPU.
       I then compared Techspots benchmarks to those featured on
       Tomshardware. First I looked at the Assassin's Creed Odyssey
       results. At 1440p, Techspot reports the Radeon RX 5700XT hit an
       average of 70fps. Meanwhile, Tomshardware was showing... oh dear,
       Odyssey wasn't featured on Tom's. Let's just move on. The
       Techspot's Destiny 2 1440p results show that.. uh oh, it's
       happening again. Techspot didn't feature Destiny 2 benchmarks. This
       is a problem because you can't compare apples-to-apples when the
       same benchmarks aren't used.
       Assassin's Creed Odyssey, Destiny 2, DiRT Rally 2.0, Far Cry 5, Far
       Cry New Dawn, Final Fantasy XV, GTA V, Resident Evil 2, Strange
       Brigade, Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,
       World War Z, The Witcher 3, Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus are
       either benchmarked by Tom's or TechSpot but not both. The only
       overlapping games are Battlefield V, Forza Horizon 4, Metro Exodus,
       Shadow of the Tomb Raider, and Tom Clancy's The Division 2.
       Let's look at the Shadow of the Tomb Raider results. Techspot and
       Tom's ran the game at 1440p, highest quality.... oh no.
       Tomshardware used SMAAT2x in it's Shadow of the Tomb Raider
       benchmark. Techspot didn't report using that setting. Well that's
       not apples-to-apples either. A similar situation happens with
       Battlefield V where Tomshardware uses DX12 and Techspot uses DX11.
       For Tom Clancy's The Division 2, I double checked to make sure the
       software is the same between both Techspot and Tom's platforms.
       DX12, 1440p, Ultra quality. Check. Now here is something that
       appears to be genuinely inconsistent between reviews. Techspot's
       averages for the GeForce 2080, 2070 Super, 2060 Super, Radeon RX
       5700, and 5700XT are higher than the Tomshardware numbers. Well
       there you have it. Redgarl has proven that "With the actual
       scoring, this review is a joke." Tomshardware losses, redgarl wins.
       Except that the test systems between Tomshardware and TechSpot are
       different. Isn't this a roller coaster? TechSpot has a better CPU
       and faster ram. I looked carefully at the trends between both
       reviews and lo and behold they show the same thing. Both sites list
       the video card pecking order as: 2080, 2070 Super, Radeon VII, 1080
       Ti, 5700XT, 2070, 2060 Super, Vega 64, 5700, 1080, 2060, and so on
       and so forth. It's very plausible that the differences in specific
       numbers can be chalked up to differences in platforms or margin of
       error.
       The charts that redgarl cherry picked show the results between Toms
       and Techspot are totally different. If you only considered those
       charts then you might think Tomshardware has an incompetent staff
       the way redgarl wants you to believe. However, when you look at the
       whole picture, its obvious that you can't directly compare the
       benchmark results between both sites. A total of 19 games were
       reviewed by both sites. Only five overlap. I threw out Shadow of
       the Tomb Raider because we can't be sure both sites used the same
       settings. That leaves four. When we directly compare results, the
       numbers vary probably due to differences in test hardware, but the
       trends are consistent. In conclusion: there isn't enough evidence
       to prove that the Tomshardware review did anything wrong.
       To redgarl, this is just for fun my dude. No hard feelings.

          + RT: 3 games so far, in which only the RTX 2080 Ti can produce

            FHD. RTX 2060 produces 50-60 average and 30 lows... That's
            what you expect from a 350$ card? Don't think so.

       And costs 100$ more. And, wow, really, 5W more than a 2070 Super,

       You are 100% right, just mentioning: if someone needs performance
       over RT feature, RX5700 is absolutely better than the RTX 2060 and
       the RX5700XT is absolutely better than the RTX2060 Super and RTX
       2070.
