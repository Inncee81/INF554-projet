We are passionate about making the web a better place.

WordPress.com

   Your blog or website
   Has a (free!) home on the web.
   Your story, your way.

Tumblr

   Blogging can be fun
   with common interests as
   the connective glue.

   Selling online? Woo!
   Hang your digital shingle
   With this free plugin.

Jetpack

   Stats, backups, speed, power:
   The first plugin your site needs
   Has it all built in.

   Time, Fortune, TED, Quartz.
   Big? The bigger the better.
   We handle them all.

VaultPress

   Your site, safe and sound.
   Auto-backups and scanning.
   Always on the job.

Akismet

   Did someone say spam?
   Akismet filters it out.
   Nothing to see here.

Longreads

   Great storytelling,
   Long enough to dig into.
   Find it and share it.

Simplenote

   Synchronization.
   Now your notes are everywhere,
   On every device.

Crowdsignal

   Opinions! We all
   Have them. Collect your readers’
   With polls and surveys.

   are happier with our tools.
   Less friction, more time!

   “Gravatar,” get it? One pic
   For all your profiles.

   like:

   Find strength in community
   For a better web.

   Community discussion.
   Forums, the new black.

   Come out from behind your screens,
   Connect, and celebrate.
