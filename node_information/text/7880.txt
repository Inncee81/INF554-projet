As sand mining grows, Asia’s deltas are sinking, water experts warn

   Manipadma Jena

   5 Min Read

   STOCKHOLM (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Sand mining from rivers is
   depriving many low-lying Asian deltas of the sediment they need to
   maintain themselves, raising the risk of worsening land loss to sea
   level rise, researchers say.

   Combined with losses of soil-holding mangroves and accelerating
   groundwater extraction, which can lead to land sinking, the mining is
   increasing climate-related threats for those living in low-lying
   coastal areas, they said.

   “We have created a recipe for climate disaster,” said Marc Goichot of
   the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).

   Deltas dependent on the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna, Mekong and Yangtze
   rivers are now sinking and shrinking, according to research carried out
   by WWF – a situation worsened by climate-related warming and rising sea
   level.

   That is a problem not only because the deltas are home to millions of
   people but because they produce a significant share of the region’s
   food.

   The Mekong delta, for instance, home to 17 million people, is a major
   source of rice for the region and underpins a quarter of Vietnam’s GDP,
   Goichot said.

   “It is 40,000 square kilometers – larger than many countries - and most
   of it is sinking,” he said.

MORE FLOODS, MORE SALT

   At the heart of the problem, Goichot said, is a lack of enough sediment
   moving down the rivers – and much of that is the result of mining of
   sand as a construction material and for other uses, he said.

   In some major rivers in Asia, such as the Mekong, Yangtze and
   Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna, as much as 90 percent of the sediment that
   once traveled down the system is now collecting in reservoirs or being
   mined, WWF’s research showed.

   That means much less material is arriving in delta areas to replace
   soil lost to coastal erosion and other natural processes.

   For those living in the deltas, it can mean growing risk of floods,
   inundation from coastal storm surges and worsening salt contamination
   in drinking water.

   Kusum Athukorala, former chair of the Sri Lanka Water Partnership, said
   the loss of sand also means less water-storage capacity in rivers, and
   less water flowing in to restore aquifers.

   That is a particular problem as climate change brings longer and hotter
   dry season and growing water stress, he said.

   Worldwide, over half a billion people live in delta areas, WWF said.

   According to the U.N. Environment Programme, though record keeping is
   poor, global consumption of sand and gravel likely exceeded 40 billion
   tonnes in 2012, up from 9 billion tonnes in the 1970s, making it one of
   the world’s most extracted resources by volume.

   “To give a sense of its use, for every bucket of cement, five to seven
   buckets of sand are used in concrete. For every kilometer of road
   built, 30,000 tonnes of sand is used as its base,” Goichot said.

   But sand is just as important in the river systems it is harvested
   from, he said.

   “Keeping sand in the rivers is the best adaptation to climate change.
   If a river delta receives enough sediment, it builds itself above sea
   level in a natural reaction,” Goichot, told the Thomson Reuters
   Foundation in an interview in Stockholm.

GROWING DEMAND

   But sand mining also feeds Asia’s rapidly growing cities. New buildings
   and roads require it and urban land is often expanded by pouring sand
   into wetlands or rice paddies.

   The island state of Singapore has expanded its land area 20 percent in
   the last 50 years, using sand dredged from the seabed but also imported
   by Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia, said Goichot.

   Sand mining remains unregulated in many areas, however, and illegal
   sand mining operations operate in as many as 70 countries worldwide,
   Goichot said.

   “In India unregulated sand mining is really an (escalating) menace,”
   said Himanshu Thakkar, coordinator of the South Asia Network on Dams,
   Rivers and People (SANDRP).

   India issues sand mining licenses, he said, which limit the quantities
   of sand that can be taken and the locations where mining is allowed.
   But with limited monitoring, “the actual mining may be very different,”
   he said.

   River sand is preferred for construction in many cases because desert
   sand is too rounded to bind concrete well, while seabed sand contains
   salt that can corrode metal and dredging it can be costly.

   But too much harvesting of river sand is now taking a toll on those
   living downstream, Goichot said, with the Mekong delta, for instance,
   losing 12 metres of land along its coast each year, the equivalent of a
   football field and a half of land every day.

   In India, insufficient effort is being put into finding alternative
   sources of sand, including from construction waste or de-silting of
   reservoirs, Thakkar said. That means “the rivers and everyone dependent
   on them are sufferers”.

Russia starts freeing captive whales after outcry - state TV

   Tom Balmforth, Gabrielle Tétrault-Farber

   3 Min Read

   MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia has begun releasing a group of almost 100
   captive whales into the wild whose detention in Russia’s Far East since
   last year has caused an international outcry, state TV said on
   Thursday.

   Six beluga and two killer whales were being transported on Thursday,
   part of a four-month operation to return all of the orcas to their
   natural habitat, a report aired during President Vladimir Putin’s
   televised annual question and answer said.

   The plight of the whales, which were held in cramped conditions and
   were meant to be sold commercially, has captured imaginations around
   the world and prompted celebrities such as actor Leonardo DiCaprio to
   petition for their release.

   The Kremlin ordered local authorities in the Russian Far East to
   intervene months ago, but the problem of how to release them without
   causing them harm caused delays.

   The beginning of their release coincided with Putin’s annual question
   and answer session, an event he uses to burnish his reputation and
   which took on new significance this year as his popularity ratings have
   slipped.

   One of the presenters asking Putin questions suggested that the Russian
   leader had been responsible for bringing about their release, while
   another state TV reporter referred to what she called the miracle
   working effect of Putin’s annual show.

   In a segment dedicated to the plight of the mammals, Deputy Prime
   Minister Alexei Gordeyev said that the orcas would be taken back to
   where they were caught, something campaigners had insisted upon, and
   released within four months in small groups.

   “We have taken the only sensible decision at the recommendation of
   scientists to rebase the animals to their natural habitat where they
   were caught, to their familiar environment,” the minister said.

   Putin welcomed the announcement, saying “finally, thank God, there is
   movement.”

   The whales were caught by four Russian companies last summer in the Sea
   of Okhotsk and were meant to be sold to marine parks or aquariums in
   China before the law changed outlawing such exports.

   Russia’s FSB security service has brought charges against the companies
   for breaking fishing laws.

   The Kremlin has said Russia has no direct ban on catching whales, but
   that they can only legally be caught in specific circumstances, for
   scientific and educational purposes.

Global temperatures on track for 3-5 degree rise by 2100: U.N.

   2 Min Read

   GENEVA (Reuters) - Global temperatures are on course for a 3-5 degrees
   Celsius (5.4-9.0 degrees Fahrenheit) rise this century, far
   overshooting a global target of limiting the increase to 2C (3.6F) or
   less, the U.N. World Meteorological Organization said on Thursday.
   [?m=02&amp;d=20181129&amp;t=2&amp;i=1329836410&amp;r=LYNXNPEEAS0QY&amp;

   “Greenhouse gas concentrations are once again at record levels and if
   the current trend continues we may see temperature increases 3-5
   degrees C by the end of the century,” Secretary-General Petteri Taalas
   said in the WMO’s annual statement on the state of the climate.

   “If we exploit all known fossil fuel resources, the temperature rise
   will be considerably higher.”

   Scientists say that it is vital to limit the rise in global
   temperatures to 2 Celsius to avert more extreme weather, rising sea
   levels and the loss of plant and animal species, although limiting the
   rise to 1.5C would have a far greater benefit.

   At the 2015 Paris climate conference, the countries of the world
   pledged to work to limit the rise to 2C, a step that will require a
   radical reduction in the use of the fossil fuels that are the primary
   cause of global warming.

   On Sunday, the most important U.N. climate conference since Paris opens
   in Katowice, Poland, in one of the most polluted coal-mining regions in
   Europe.

   The talks are intended to produce a “rule book” on how to implement the
   2015 Paris Agreement, which the United States, at the behest of
   President Donald Trump, has announced it will quit.

   Success, according to the conference’s Polish host, will need a
   miracle.

   Taalas said that the lower end of the range, a 3C rise in temperatures,
   came from a model assuming that countries acted on their pledges to
   meet the Paris targets.

   “If all the countries were able to meet their pledges, we would be able
   to reach 3 degrees, which would mean a growing amount of disasters and
   difficulties with agriculture,” he said.

   But he added that the economic and technological means already existed
   to limit the rise to 1.5C.

Bug business: Cockroaches corralled by the millions in China to crunch waste

   Thomas Suen, Ryan Woo

   4 Min Read

   JINAN, China (Reuters) - In the near pitch-dark, you can hear them
   before you see them - millions of cockroaches scuttling and fluttering
   across stacks of wooden boards as they devour food scraps by the tonne
   in a novel form of urban waste disposal.

   The air is warm and humid - just as cockroaches like it - to ensure the
   colonies keep their health and voracious appetites.

   Expanding Chinese cities are generating more food waste than they can
   accommodate in landfills, and cockroaches could be a way to get rid of
   hills of food scraps, providing nutritious food for livestock when the
   bugs eventually die and, some say, cures for stomach illness and beauty
   treatments.

   On the outskirts of Jinan, capital of eastern Shandong province, a
   billion cockroaches are being fed with 50 tonnes of kitchen waste a day
   - the equivalent in weight to seven adult elephants.

   The waste arrives before daybreak at the plant run by
   Shandong Qiaobin Agricultural Technology Co, where it is fed through
   pipes to cockroaches in their cells.

   Shandong Qiaobin plans to set up three more such plants next year,
   aiming to process a third of the kitchen waste produced by Jinan, home
   to about seven million people.

   A nationwide ban on using food waste as pig feed due to African swine
   fever outbreaks is also spurring the growth of the cockroach industry.

   “Cockroaches are a bio-technological pathway for the converting and
   processing of kitchen waste,” said Liu Yusheng, president of Shandong
   Insect Industry Association.

   Cockroaches are also a good source of protein for pigs and other
   livestock. “It’s like turning trash into resources,” said
   Shandong Qiaobin chairwoman Li Hongyi.

“ESSENCE OF COCKROACH”

   In a remote village in Sichuan, Li Bingcai, 47, has similar ideas.

   Li, formerly a mobile phone vendor, has invested a million yuan
   ($146,300) in cockroaches, which he sells to pig farms and fisheries as
   feed and to drug companies as medicinal ingredients.

   His farm now has 3.4 million cockroaches.

   “People think it’s strange that I do this kind of business,” Li said.
   “It has great economic value, and my goal is to lead other villagers to
   prosperity if they follow my lead.”

   His village has two farms. Li’s goal is to create 20.

   Elsewhere in Sichuan, a company called Gooddoctor is rearing six
   billion cockroaches.

   “The essence of cockroach is good for curing oral and peptic ulcers,
   skin wounds and even stomach cancer,” said Wen Jianguo, manager of
   Gooddoctor’s cockroach facility.

   Researchers are also looking into using cockroach extract in beauty
   masks, diet pills and even hair-loss treatments.

   At Gooddoctor, when cockroaches reach the end of their lifespan of
   about six months, they are blasted by steam, washed and dried, before
   being sent to a huge nutrient extraction tank.

   Asked about the chance of the cockroaches escaping, Wen said that would
   be worthy of a disaster movie but that he has taken precautions.

   “We have a moat filled with water and fish,” he said. “If the
   cockroaches escape, they will fall into the moat and the fish will eat
   them all.”
