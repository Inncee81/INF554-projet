   A God-fearing family in Victorian England buried a giant Ichthyosaurus
   fossil out of concern it could threaten their Christian beliefs. Now,
   after some 150 years and a change of heart, the family has unearthed
   the stunning prehistoric fossil.

   The Ichthyosaurus fossil was discovered in 1850 by the family of cider
   brandy maker Julian Temperley in Somerset, England. Local paper Burnham
   & Highbridge Weekly News reports the family were builders' merchants at
   the time and unearthed the relic while digging in a quarry.

   After returning the fossil to their home, the family decided to bury it
   as they didn’t want to feel they were “denying God” and the creation
   story by displaying it. After all, this was several years before
   Charles Darwin published the bible of evolution by natural selection,
   On the Origin of Species.

   Temperley recalls regularly unearthing the fossil as a child with his
   family, however, it was always reburied after they caught a good
   glimpse. When the Somerset Levels were hit by severe flooding in the
   winter of 2013 to 2014, he finally decided it was time to unearth the
   beast for good.

   "Whenever we visited Somerset as kids, we dug it up and were generally
   amazed,” Temperley told Western Morning News.

   ichthyosaurus - on display at the Natural History Museum in London.

   "But after the flooding of 2013-14 we realized it was not a good idea
   to leave it buried and I thought we ought to look after it."

   He employed the help of professional fossil collector Chris Moore to
   excavate the fossil and clear it up. By all accounts, it’s a pretty
   impressive specimen. An image of the so-called Temperley Ichthyosaurus
   is also set to get on the label of Temperley’s cider brandy.

   Ichthyosaurus, meaning “fish lizard”, is a genus of ichthyosaur, a
   diverse group of extinct marine reptile that resembled a dolphin-like
   lizard. Some of the earliest fossils were discovered in the early 19th
   century by the English palaeontologist and fossil-finding maestro Mary
   Anning. The largest discovered specimen of an Ichthyosaurus, unearthed
   in the mid-1990s, measured between 3 and 3.5 meters (10 and 11.5 feet)
   in length, although most species were small.

   The ichthyosaurs were arguably one of the most successful lineages
   ever. They occupied a wide variety of niches and were very widely
   distributed, leaving behind fossil remains that span most of the
   Mesozoic Era (251 million to 65.5 million years ago).

   What a beauty. Christina Koch/NASA

   In an image that looks more fantastical than real, NASA astronaut
   Christina Koch snapped a photograph of the Russian Soyuz spacecraft
   with her best friend on board as it hurtled towards the International
   Space Station after blasting off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in
   Kazakhstan.

   "What it looks like from @Space_Station when your best friend achieves
   her lifelong dream to go to space. Caught the second stage in progress!
   We can’t wait to welcome you onboard, crew of Soyuz 61!" she tweeted.
   -

   The friend she speaks of is flight engineer Jessica Meir, who arrived
   with her colleagues – Oleg Skripochka and Hazzaa Ali Almansoori – on
   the orbital outpost six hours after launch. This is Meir’s first launch
   into space, where she will live aboard the space station until spring
   2020, helping her crewmates with around 250 research experiments,
   according to NASA.

   Christina Koch is currently aboard the space station as part of
   Expedition 59, 60, and now 61. She is expected to set the women's
   record for longest single spaceflight with 328 days in space.

   The luminous sphere and squiggle above the curve of Earth's horizon is
   the exhaust from the initial rocket. The launch is Expedition 61, where
   crew members will perform a series of spacewalks to install new
   lithium-ion batteries for solar array power channels on the ISS. They
   will also repair the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer that helps researchers
   study dark matter and, you know, just the origins of the universe.

   Andrew Morgan, a NASA astronaut currently aboard the ISS who previously
   worked as an emergency physician in the US Army, also tweeted: “All six
   members of #Expedition60 packed into the cupola, our window on the
   Earth, to see this rare spectacle.”

   Here's What's Actually Happening At Area 51 Right Now

   The Area 51 storm was always going to go one of two ways, according to
   the Internet memes.

   Option one:

   We were going to show up and a wave of Kyles, aided by furries and
   Karens, would distract the fire of the armed guards while the rest of
   us snuck around the back, at which point we would liberate the aliens
   from their captors and "clap alien cheeks". Nobody would get injured
   because we had Naruto run at the guards (thus dodging all their
   bullets).
   -
   -
   -


   Option two:

   We would actually show up and it would play out realistically. The wave
   of Kyles and Karens would be mown down by army fire as they attempted
   to Naruto run into an actual military air base.
   -

   So, in many ways, it's probably best that it played out as secret
   option number three: Everyone realized it was a joke and basically
   behaved themselves, bar one or two minor incidents.

   People arrived with the expressed intention to "clap them cheeks".
   -
   -

   And practiced their Naruto run. A lot.
   -
   -
   -

   But when it came down to actually raiding Area 51, that didn't actually
   materialize.
   -

   That isn't to say that the police didn't have to get involved.

   "On September 20 at approximately 3am, Nye County Sheriff's Office
   responded to the alien travel center on highway 373," the Sheriff's
   Office said in a video statement.

   "Crowds of approximately 40 people surrounded the parking lot of the
   travel center and made threats to storm the gates of Area 51. The crowd
   was compliant for commands from deputies and eventually dispersed. Some
   participants then assembled at the north and south gates, but heeded
   warnings upon confrontation with law enforcement and retreated. Several
   participants moved back and forth between the two gates and crowds
   continued to gather."

   If they were going to Naruto run at all, now was their chance.

   "At approximately 05:00, all participants had retreated and dispersed.
   Everyone was compliant and peaceful. All Nye County resources were
   returned to their assigned posts."

   The closest they came to any actual confrontation was one incident that
   resulted in a woman being detained for trying to trespass into Area 51,
   whilst a man was arrested for public urination just outside Area 51.
   -

   Part of the "raid" was captured on YouTube.

   This Guy Died One Of The Most Horrible Deaths In History

   History is filled with nauseatingly horrendous deaths that would bring
   tears to the eyes of most present-day revelers. But of all the cruel
   and unusual ways to reach the fateful end, few are more grueling than
   the one documented in a recently discovered skeleton.

   As reported in the Journal of Archaeological Science, archaeologists
   from the University of Milan have unearthed the Medieval skeleton of a
   man who appears to have died after a notoriously painful torture method
   and a botched beheading.

   The man died at a relatively young age, between 17 and 20 years of age,
   at some point during the 13th century and was buried near a cathedral
   in Milan, northern Italy.

   First impressions of his skeleton showed that he was suffering from
   wounds symmetrically positioned across his arms and legs, which hints
   at some kind of intentional injury. Based on historical records, the
   researchers hypothesized that the man had been tortured using “the
   wheel,” aka the "breaking wheel" or the "Catharine wheel".

   For those blissfully unaware of the wheel, it was a torture device used
   for public execution throughout much of European history until the
   start of the early modern era (c. 1500). Accounts of how this device
   was used differ depending on time and place, but it generally involved
   the methodical smashing and snapping of limbs, followed by afflicting
   further wheel-based trauma.

   In some accounts, torturers start by dropping the heavy wooden wheel
   onto people’s limbs, starting on the shin bones and working their way
   up. Once their body is sufficient battered, the broken limbs would be
   weaved in and out of the wheel spokes or tightly fastened to it using a
   rope. Injuries were then further afflicted – using either blades, blunt
   objects, fire, whips, or red-hot pincers – after which the wheel was
   mounted on a pole and proudly hung like a flag. The near-dead victim
   would hang here for some time, perhaps days or weeks, until they
   eventually perished or were put out of their misery with an execution.

   The grueling torture technique was most often used against those
   accused of heinous crimes, but in northern Italy, where this body was
   found, this kind of torture was usually reserved for persons suspected
   of being plague spreaders.

   “The victim of the wheel could have been considered as different by his
   contemporaries, and possibly this discrimination may have been the
   cause of his final conviction, as he could have been sacrificed, being
   a “freak”, by an angry crowd, as a plague spreader,” the researchers
   write.

   As if this wasn’t enough, forensic analysis of his skeleton discovered
   also revealed unusual linear fractures at the cranial base of his
   skull. This was most likely, the researchers say, the result of a sharp
   force trauma from a heavy weapon during a “clumsy decapitation."

   If this hypothesis of wheel torture is on the money, the researchers
   will have documented the first archaeological evidence a human being
   tortured by the wheel, certainly in medieval northern Italy, if not the
   world.

   One thing is more certain: this unfortunate soul did not have an
   enjoyable final few days on Earth.

   Lost Scrolls Charred By Mount Vesuvius Will Soon Be 'Virtually
   Unwrapped'

   In 79 CE, as Mount Vesuvius rained hell down on the towns of Pompeii
   and Herculaneum below, a fine set of scrolls laid in a private library
   near the coastline. Along with much of the towns and their people, the
   scrolls were carbonized through a blast of hot volcanic debris, searing
   them into lumps of brittle carbon that are too fragile to unravel.

   Now, almost 2,000 years on, a team of researchers say they finally have
   the technology to decipher the papyrus text.

   Scientists from the University of Kentucky have employed the help
   of Diamond Light Source, a synchrotron light source science facility in
   the UK, to blast the carbonized scrolls with high-energy X-rays to pick
   up on subtle hints of ink that are invisible to the naked eye. They
   will then use artificial intelligence to “fill in the gaps.”

   “We do not expect to immediately see the text from the upcoming scans,
   but they will provide the crucial building blocks for enabling that
   visualization," Professor Brent Seales, director of the Digital
   Restoration Initiative at the University of Kentucky, explained in
   a statement. "First, we will immediately see the internal structure of
   the scrolls in more definition than has ever been possible, and we need
   that level of detail to ferret out the highly compressed layers on
   which the text sits.

   “The machine-learning tool we are developing will amplify that ink
   signal by training a computer algorithm to recognize it – pixel by
   pixel – from photographs of opened fragments that show exactly where
   the ink is – voxel by voxel – in the corresponding tomographic data of
   the fragment,” he added.

   This particular set of scrolls, consisting of two complete scrolls and
   four fragments, were found alongside thousands of other papyri in 1752
   around the ruins of a Roman villa near the Bay of Naples. Collectively
   known as the Herculaneum papyri, the texts are thought to be the only
   surviving library from antiquity that exists in its entirety. The texts
   that have been successfully studied namely contain writings of a
   philosophical nature that provide a fascinating insight into the world
   of the Roman Empire.

   Many of these scrolls remain tightly closed and impossible to read in
   their current state. There have been attempts to physically unfurl a
   handful of the closed Herculaneum scrolls, however, the researchers say
   these have been “largely disastrous.” As such, many of the texts have
   remained untouched and their wisdom unknown.

   Judging by the team and technology being used this time around, the
   scrolls are in safe hands. Professor Seales, the computer scientist
   leading the work, has previously been involved in efforts to use
   imaging techniques on all kinds of ancient documents, including the
   En-Gedi scroll, the earliest copy ever found of an Old Testament Bible
   scripture.
