   Best parts:
   It was our honeymoon and the agency had prepared many special treats
   for us (champaign, flowers, romantic dinner). Thank you so much for
   that! Our agent Ricardo organized everything perfectly. All guides were
   very interesting, all the organization went well. We felt the agency
   was very professional and understood our needs.
   Worst parts:
   Self driving in Cuba is not easy and can be stressful. If you're not
   used to Latin America, don't choose self driving. The organization was
   great but we would have enjoyed to have more details in advance
   (meeting time with the guides each day, etc) Cuba in August is really
   hot and humid! If we come, we'll choose to come in winter.

   Best parts:
   great organization, and best contact with local agencies to make our
   trip a smooth sailing experience! Everything was perfect in organizing
   our trip to what we wanted at the pace we requested! We spend 10 days
   in cuba with some of the best transfers to the amazing host at each
   location, From our arrival at the airport a company rep. was there to
   welcome us and to make sure our schedule was ready for all tours. This
   was our first time using Evaneos and for sure not our last!
   Worst parts:
   I don't think we had any issues with anything, they accomplished
   everything !

   Maestra mountains,to Camaguey, Sancti Spiritus, Trinidad, Cienfuegos,
   Santa Clara (and the Che mausoleum), Bay of Pigs, Habana, Vinales, Mil

   Best parts:
   It was our honeymoon and the agency had prepared many special treats
   for us (champaign, flowers, romantic dinner). Thank you so much for
   that! Our agent Ricardo organized everything perfectly. All guides were
   very interesting, all the organization went well. We felt the agency
   was very professional and understood our needs.
   Worst parts:
   Self driving in Cuba is not easy and can be stressful. If you're not
   used to Latin America, don't choose self driving. The organization was
   great but we would have enjoyed to have more details in advance
   (meeting time with the guides each day, etc) Cuba in August is really
   hot and humid! If we come, we'll choose to come in winter.

   Best parts:
   great organization, and best contact with local agencies to make our
   trip a smooth sailing experience! Everything was perfect in organizing
   our trip to what we wanted at the pace we requested! We spend 10 days
   in cuba with some of the best transfers to the amazing host at each
   location, From our arrival at the airport a company rep. was there to
   welcome us and to make sure our schedule was ready for all tours. This
   was our first time using Evaneos and for sure not our last!
   Worst parts:
   I don't think we had any issues with anything, they accomplished
   everything !

   We loved Cuba, its people, its landscape and its history. We spent 3
   weeks with a guide travelling from Santiago de Cuba, in the Ierra
   Maestra mountains,to Camaguey, Sancti Spiritus, Trinidad, Cienfuegos,
   Santa Clara (and the Che mausoleum), Bay of Pigs, Habana, Vinales, Mil
   Cumbres and back to Habana. Highlights included the music and Salsa at
   the Casas de la Trova, visits to historical sites and museums, and the
   ascents of Pico Turrquino and Pan de Guajaibon
