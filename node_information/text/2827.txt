It's the oil economy, stupid

   With its presidential candidates divided over war with Iraq, the
   Democratic Party once again looks confused and weak on national
   security. In a climate of fear around terrorism, attacking the
   president on domestic issues like health care and the economy simply
   won't be enough to take back the White House in 2004.

   One issue above all others has the potential to excite both
   conservative and liberal wings of the party on national security, and
   that's freeing America from its dependence on Middle East oil. Voters
   understand that our reliance on this oil increases America's
   vulnerability to terrorist attacks, wars and economic turbulence. They
   know that oil isn't behind all of the problems in the Middle East but
   that it exacerbates enough of them to demand a response. And across the
   board, voters fear our president doesn't take the issue seriously.

   Democrats today have an opportunity to inspire the country with a
   hopeful vision, akin to a new Apollo Project, one that weans America
   off Middle East oil in favor of solar and wind energy in 10 years while
   creating millions of new jobs.

   Like JFK's Apollo Project, which put a man on the moon in under a
   decade, Apollo II would be big, bold and fast. If terrorism, war and
   economic uncertainty symbolize our oil economy, it makes sense that
   Apollo, the Greek god of the sun, should represent the new energy
   economy.

   Presidential adviser Karl Rove knows well that the Bush family's close
   political and business ties to Saudi oil billionaires is the soft
   underbelly of the administration's foreign policy. It's not hard to
   imagine Rove awake at night fearing the attack ads to come: slow-motion
   video of Bush yucking it up with Saudi princes while a James Earl
   Jones-type narrator warns of "the Axis of Oil."

   Rove is already trying to pre-empt the coming Democratic assault on
   Bush's Saudi energy policy. During his State of the Union address the
   president announced that he will request $1.2 billion for 10 years of
   research and development of fuel-cell cars. It may have sounded like a
   lot of money, but it's not. The paltry sum will do literally nothing to
   get better cars on the road, much less reduce our dependence on Middle
   East oil.

   Jump-starting the transition away from oil and toward clean energy
   won't be cheap -- and that's a good thing for Democrats because oil
   independence will require economic stimulus at home.

   Experts estimate the cost of creating a national hydrogen
   infrastructure to power fuel cell cars at roughly $150 billion.
   Bringing down the cost of clean energy technologies, like solar, wind
   and biomass, to generate the necessary hydrogen fuel will likely cost
   another $150 billion.

   That's a big investment, to be sure. It's also less than half of the
   president's proposed tax cuts for the rich.

   Democratic presidential candidates Dick Gephardt and John Kerry have
   paid lip service to energy security but they haven't yet put their
   money where their mouths are. If the Democrats hope to distinguish
   their program from the president's, they must campaign for serious
   economic stimulus to hasten our independence from Middle East oil.

   The risk is that the Democrats will try to have it both ways. They'll
   propose tax cuts for the middle class and modest investments in clean
   energy. This would be a mistake. The public trusts Republicans, not
   Democrats, to deliver tax cuts, and it trusts Democrats, not
   Republicans, to create jobs.

   The economic case for Apollo II is obvious. America lost more than 10
   percent of its manufacturing jobs during the last four years. (Many of
   those lost jobs were in Ohio and Michigan -- two swing states.) During
   that same period, the United States lost clean-energy market share to
   foreign companies. Japan increased its market share of solar
   manufacturing from 25 to 50 percent in just five years. Europe today
   controls 90 percent of the world's wind- turbine production. America is
   getting beat for the simple fact that the Japanese and European
   governments have guaranteed and subsidized the market for clean energy
   and ours hasn't.

   Apollo II will play to the traditional strengths of the Democrats.
   Twenty high-skilled manufacturing, engineering, installation and
   service jobs are created for every megawatt of solar panels produced.
   And Apollo II will appeal equally to party hawks and doves,
   environmentalists and blue-collar workers. If swing voters in
   battleground states like Michigan and Ohio are asked to choose, they'll
   opt for new jobs and energy security over tax cuts for the rich every
   time.

   American presidents have traditionally used wars to justify large,
   strategic investments in infrastructure and emerging industries, from
   the interstate highway system to the Internet. Only by calling for a
   similarly large project on energy security will Democrats be able to
   position themselves as stronger than the president on homeland security
   while outflanking him on foreign policy.

It's the oil economy, stupid

   With its presidential candidates divided over war with Iraq, the
   Democratic Party once again looks confused and weak on national
   security. In a climate of fear around terrorism, attacking the
   president on domestic issues like health care and the economy simply
   won't be enough to take back the White House in 2004.

   One issue above all others has the potential to excite both
   conservative and liberal wings of the party on national security, and
   that's freeing America from its dependence on Middle East oil. Voters
   understand that our reliance on this oil increases America's
   vulnerability to terrorist attacks, wars and economic turbulence. They
   know that oil isn't behind all of the problems in the Middle East but
   that it exacerbates enough of them to demand a response. And across the
   board, voters fear our president doesn't take the issue seriously.

   Democrats today have an opportunity to inspire the country with a
   hopeful vision, akin to a new Apollo Project, one that weans America
   off Middle East oil in favor of solar and wind energy in 10 years while
   creating millions of new jobs.

   Like JFK's Apollo Project, which put a man on the moon in under a
   decade, Apollo II would be big, bold and fast. If terrorism, war and
   economic uncertainty symbolize our oil economy, it makes sense that
   Apollo, the Greek god of the sun, should represent the new energy
   economy.

   Presidential adviser Karl Rove knows well that the Bush family's close
   political and business ties to Saudi oil billionaires is the soft
   underbelly of the administration's foreign policy. It's not hard to
   imagine Rove awake at night fearing the attack ads to come: slow-motion
   video of Bush yucking it up with Saudi princes while a James Earl
   Jones-type narrator warns of "the Axis of Oil."

   Rove is already trying to pre-empt the coming Democratic assault on
   Bush's Saudi energy policy. During his State of the Union address the
   president announced that he will request $1.2 billion for 10 years of
   research and development of fuel-cell cars. It may have sounded like a
   lot of money, but it's not. The paltry sum will do literally nothing to
   get better cars on the road, much less reduce our dependence on Middle
   East oil.

   Jump-starting the transition away from oil and toward clean energy
   won't be cheap -- and that's a good thing for Democrats because oil
   independence will require economic stimulus at home.

   Experts estimate the cost of creating a national hydrogen
   infrastructure to power fuel cell cars at roughly $150 billion.
   Bringing down the cost of clean energy technologies, like solar, wind
   and biomass, to generate the necessary hydrogen fuel will likely cost
   another $150 billion.

   That's a big investment, to be sure. It's also less than half of the
   president's proposed tax cuts for the rich.

   Democratic presidential candidates Dick Gephardt and John Kerry have
   paid lip service to energy security but they haven't yet put their
   money where their mouths are. If the Democrats hope to distinguish
   their program from the president's, they must campaign for serious
   economic stimulus to hasten our independence from Middle East oil.

   The risk is that the Democrats will try to have it both ways. They'll
   propose tax cuts for the middle class and modest investments in clean
   energy. This would be a mistake. The public trusts Republicans, not
   Democrats, to deliver tax cuts, and it trusts Democrats, not
   Republicans, to create jobs.

   The economic case for Apollo II is obvious. America lost more than 10
   percent of its manufacturing jobs during the last four years. (Many of
   those lost jobs were in Ohio and Michigan -- two swing states.) During
   that same period, the United States lost clean-energy market share to
   foreign companies. Japan increased its market share of solar
   manufacturing from 25 to 50 percent in just five years. Europe today
   controls 90 percent of the world's wind- turbine production. America is
   getting beat for the simple fact that the Japanese and European
   governments have guaranteed and subsidized the market for clean energy
   and ours hasn't.

   Apollo II will play to the traditional strengths of the Democrats.
   Twenty high-skilled manufacturing, engineering, installation and
   service jobs are created for every megawatt of solar panels produced.
   And Apollo II will appeal equally to party hawks and doves,
   environmentalists and blue-collar workers. If swing voters in
   battleground states like Michigan and Ohio are asked to choose, they'll
   opt for new jobs and energy security over tax cuts for the rich every
   time.

   American presidents have traditionally used wars to justify large,
   strategic investments in infrastructure and emerging industries, from
   the interstate highway system to the Internet. Only by calling for a
   similarly large project on energy security will Democrats be able to
   position themselves as stronger than the president on homeland security
   while outflanking him on foreign policy.

It's the oil economy, stupid

   With its presidential candidates divided over war with Iraq, the
   Democratic Party once again looks confused and weak on national
   security. In a climate of fear around terrorism, attacking the
   president on domestic issues like health care and the economy simply
   won't be enough to take back the White House in 2004.

   One issue above all others has the potential to excite both
   conservative and liberal wings of the party on national security, and
   that's freeing America from its dependence on Middle East oil. Voters
   understand that our reliance on this oil increases America's
   vulnerability to terrorist attacks, wars and economic turbulence. They
   know that oil isn't behind all of the problems in the Middle East but
   that it exacerbates enough of them to demand a response. And across the
   board, voters fear our president doesn't take the issue seriously.

   Democrats today have an opportunity to inspire the country with a
   hopeful vision, akin to a new Apollo Project, one that weans America
   off Middle East oil in favor of solar and wind energy in 10 years while
   creating millions of new jobs.

   Like JFK's Apollo Project, which put a man on the moon in under a
   decade, Apollo II would be big, bold and fast. If terrorism, war and
   economic uncertainty symbolize our oil economy, it makes sense that
   Apollo, the Greek god of the sun, should represent the new energy
   economy.

   Presidential adviser Karl Rove knows well that the Bush family's close
   political and business ties to Saudi oil billionaires is the soft
   underbelly of the administration's foreign policy. It's not hard to
   imagine Rove awake at night fearing the attack ads to come: slow-motion
   video of Bush yucking it up with Saudi princes while a James Earl
   Jones-type narrator warns of "the Axis of Oil."

   Rove is already trying to pre-empt the coming Democratic assault on
   Bush's Saudi energy policy. During his State of the Union address the
   president announced that he will request $1.2 billion for 10 years of
   research and development of fuel-cell cars. It may have sounded like a
   lot of money, but it's not. The paltry sum will do literally nothing to
   get better cars on the road, much less reduce our dependence on Middle
   East oil.

   Jump-starting the transition away from oil and toward clean energy
   won't be cheap -- and that's a good thing for Democrats because oil
   independence will require economic stimulus at home.

   Experts estimate the cost of creating a national hydrogen
   infrastructure to power fuel cell cars at roughly $150 billion.
   Bringing down the cost of clean energy technologies, like solar, wind
   and biomass, to generate the necessary hydrogen fuel will likely cost
   another $150 billion.

   That's a big investment, to be sure. It's also less than half of the
   president's proposed tax cuts for the rich.

   Democratic presidential candidates Dick Gephardt and John Kerry have
   paid lip service to energy security but they haven't yet put their
   money where their mouths are. If the Democrats hope to distinguish
   their program from the president's, they must campaign for serious
   economic stimulus to hasten our independence from Middle East oil.

   The risk is that the Democrats will try to have it both ways. They'll
   propose tax cuts for the middle class and modest investments in clean
   energy. This would be a mistake. The public trusts Republicans, not
   Democrats, to deliver tax cuts, and it trusts Democrats, not
   Republicans, to create jobs.

   The economic case for Apollo II is obvious. America lost more than 10
   percent of its manufacturing jobs during the last four years. (Many of
   those lost jobs were in Ohio and Michigan -- two swing states.) During
   that same period, the United States lost clean-energy market share to
   foreign companies. Japan increased its market share of solar
   manufacturing from 25 to 50 percent in just five years. Europe today
   controls 90 percent of the world's wind- turbine production. America is
   getting beat for the simple fact that the Japanese and European
   governments have guaranteed and subsidized the market for clean energy
   and ours hasn't.

   Apollo II will play to the traditional strengths of the Democrats.
   Twenty high-skilled manufacturing, engineering, installation and
   service jobs are created for every megawatt of solar panels produced.
   And Apollo II will appeal equally to party hawks and doves,
   environmentalists and blue-collar workers. If swing voters in
   battleground states like Michigan and Ohio are asked to choose, they'll
   opt for new jobs and energy security over tax cuts for the rich every
   time.

   American presidents have traditionally used wars to justify large,
   strategic investments in infrastructure and emerging industries, from
   the interstate highway system to the Internet. Only by calling for a
   similarly large project on energy security will Democrats be able to
   position themselves as stronger than the president on homeland security
   while outflanking him on foreign policy.

It's the oil economy, stupid

   With its presidential candidates divided over war with Iraq, the
   Democratic Party once again looks confused and weak on national
   security. In a climate of fear around terrorism, attacking the
   president on domestic issues like health care and the economy simply
   won't be enough to take back the White House in 2004.

   One issue above all others has the potential to excite both
   conservative and liberal wings of the party on national security, and
   that's freeing America from its dependence on Middle East oil. Voters
   understand that our reliance on this oil increases America's
   vulnerability to terrorist attacks, wars and economic turbulence. They
   know that oil isn't behind all of the problems in the Middle East but
   that it exacerbates enough of them to demand a response. And across the
   board, voters fear our president doesn't take the issue seriously.

   Democrats today have an opportunity to inspire the country with a
   hopeful vision, akin to a new Apollo Project, one that weans America
   off Middle East oil in favor of solar and wind energy in 10 years while
   creating millions of new jobs.

   Like JFK's Apollo Project, which put a man on the moon in under a
   decade, Apollo II would be big, bold and fast. If terrorism, war and
   economic uncertainty symbolize our oil economy, it makes sense that
   Apollo, the Greek god of the sun, should represent the new energy
   economy.

   Presidential adviser Karl Rove knows well that the Bush family's close
   political and business ties to Saudi oil billionaires is the soft
   underbelly of the administration's foreign policy. It's not hard to
   imagine Rove awake at night fearing the attack ads to come: slow-motion
   video of Bush yucking it up with Saudi princes while a James Earl
   Jones-type narrator warns of "the Axis of Oil."

   Rove is already trying to pre-empt the coming Democratic assault on
   Bush's Saudi energy policy. During his State of the Union address the
   president announced that he will request $1.2 billion for 10 years of
   research and development of fuel-cell cars. It may have sounded like a
   lot of money, but it's not. The paltry sum will do literally nothing to
   get better cars on the road, much less reduce our dependence on Middle
   East oil.

   Jump-starting the transition away from oil and toward clean energy
   won't be cheap -- and that's a good thing for Democrats because oil
   independence will require economic stimulus at home.

   Experts estimate the cost of creating a national hydrogen
   infrastructure to power fuel cell cars at roughly $150 billion.
   Bringing down the cost of clean energy technologies, like solar, wind
   and biomass, to generate the necessary hydrogen fuel will likely cost
   another $150 billion.

   That's a big investment, to be sure. It's also less than half of the
   president's proposed tax cuts for the rich.

   Democratic presidential candidates Dick Gephardt and John Kerry have
   paid lip service to energy security but they haven't yet put their
   money where their mouths are. If the Democrats hope to distinguish
   their program from the president's, they must campaign for serious
   economic stimulus to hasten our independence from Middle East oil.

   The risk is that the Democrats will try to have it both ways. They'll
   propose tax cuts for the middle class and modest investments in clean
   energy. This would be a mistake. The public trusts Republicans, not
   Democrats, to deliver tax cuts, and it trusts Democrats, not
   Republicans, to create jobs.

   The economic case for Apollo II is obvious. America lost more than 10
   percent of its manufacturing jobs during the last four years. (Many of
   those lost jobs were in Ohio and Michigan -- two swing states.) During
   that same period, the United States lost clean-energy market share to
   foreign companies. Japan increased its market share of solar
   manufacturing from 25 to 50 percent in just five years. Europe today
   controls 90 percent of the world's wind- turbine production. America is
   getting beat for the simple fact that the Japanese and European
   governments have guaranteed and subsidized the market for clean energy
   and ours hasn't.

   Apollo II will play to the traditional strengths of the Democrats.
   Twenty high-skilled manufacturing, engineering, installation and
   service jobs are created for every megawatt of solar panels produced.
   And Apollo II will appeal equally to party hawks and doves,
   environmentalists and blue-collar workers. If swing voters in
   battleground states like Michigan and Ohio are asked to choose, they'll
   opt for new jobs and energy security over tax cuts for the rich every
   time.

   American presidents have traditionally used wars to justify large,
   strategic investments in infrastructure and emerging industries, from
   the interstate highway system to the Internet. Only by calling for a
   similarly large project on energy security will Democrats be able to
   position themselves as stronger than the president on homeland security
   while outflanking him on foreign policy.
