Introducing the Adform Cross-Device Graph

   Thought Leadership
   Share
   August 14, 2019

   With the proliferation of data, devices, logins, and different media
   types, conventional targeting tools originally designed for a
   desktop-only landscape are insufficient on their own. This trend has
   given rise to an increasing need for cross-device solutions that
   connect the dots between that data and corresponding profiles to bridge
   the gaps and draw order from the noise.  While cross-device has been a
   core capability within our offering for years, the underlying identity
   graphs were powered by external partners. We have now decided to take
   more ownership for the benefit of our clients and have massively
   invested in creating Adform’s own cross-device graph.

   Current research suggests the number of networked devices per person
   will continue to climb, reaching between 9-10 devices by 2025. At the
   same time, we’re already seeing that advertisers without a cross-device
   solution in place attribute on average between 20-30% fewer
   conversions. Meanwhile, things like ad fatigue continue to grow as a
   primary point of concern and source for ad wastage.

   For Advertisers, the ability to accurately track and project real Cost
   Per Acquisition and to set the right ad exposure levels via
   cross-device frequency capping is more important than ever. All of this
   requires a comprehensive, reliable, and privacy-compliant series of
   tools that help Marketeers to effectively engage with their audience.

   The Adform Difference

   Our decision to launch the Adform Cross-Device Graph revolves around
   several key considerations. With privacy, governance, speed, and
   transparency into all aspects of ad tech being more important than
   ever, bringing cross-device in-house helps us to better serve the needs
   of our clients.  Launching our own cross-device graph fully integrated
   into the Adform platform delivers significant synergies and added value
   for clients that take advantage of the offering.

   Just a couple of years ago, standard cross-device graph updates were
   done on a weekly basis. In some instances, that’s still the case. In
   others, those updates are done more often – but still typically on a
   24-hour cycle. With our new internal solution, this time is reduced
   significantly. A central benefit of the Integrated Advertising Platform
   is added control over when to rebuild and update the graph, which is
   driven by the direct needs of Adform’s clients.  Fast-moving IDs are
   captured to provide a realistic profile of user activity and thus
   advertiser opportunity.  Adform is proud to have created a graph
   providing up to 20% higher reach - while delivering the highest
   quality.

   More Reasons to Use Cross-Device

   Cross-Device helps reduce ad waste and user fatigue caused by
   irrelevant and repetitive ads for campaigns that run for multiple days
   or weeks. In these cases, the use of Cross-Device will often pay for
   itself and is an essential tool every marketer should be leveraging:

   For Branding
     * Communicate more clearly with people-based targeting
     * Target users across multiple devices
     * Improve performance metrics

   For Prospecting
     * Identify and more effectively engage with relevant prospects
     * Capture enhanced data for better algorithmic performance
     * Support informed decisioning for top performing media and buying
       channels

   Retargeting and Performance
     * Recognize and capture all opportunities, not a mixture of fragments
     * Rapidly optimize conversion rates to reduce the risk of overspend
       or wastage

   Backed by Odin, Adform Cross-Device Delivers Solid Savings

   With cross-device, a small up-front investment delivers significant
   potential savings. Odin, Adform’s advanced AI, powers Adform
   Cross-Device’s ability to rapidly crunch massive datasets, generate
   relational data, and help you optimize your campaigns. The potential
   savings this enables and the rapid payoff Cross-Device can deliver is
   most obvious in benchmark campaigns like the following where the true
   impact and cost savings of cross-device backed frequency capping is
   highlighted.
   Cross-Device in Practice

   In this benchmark campaign, the advertiser utilized cross-device with a
   frequency cap of three. The result was a significant reduction in
   impressions required and unique ID’s detected when reaching the same
   target audience. After factoring in the added CPM cost for Adform
   cross-device usage, this led to a 37% increase in ROAS.

   Don't Miss the Webinar

   Join us for a free introductory webinar where we'll introduce you to
   the value of cross-device, while also touching on how the Adform

Introducing Dynamic CPM

   Superior Bid Shading is Just the Beginning
   Thought Leadership
   Share
   June 13, 2019

   With rapid changes in buying dynamics, including the pivot from second
   to first price auction, there’s a strong need for new buying mechanics
   that take the guesswork out of placing your bids. Today, we’re
   introducing the latest addition to our suite of buying algorithms with
   the introduction of Dynamic CPM (dCPM).

   Dynamic CPM delivers an expanded set of optimization options that work
   efficiently while taking into consideration the sophisticated needs of
   hybrid auctioning environments such as first, second and hybrid auction
   dynamics. Dynamic CPM further serves as a foundation for an exciting
   new assortment of multi-objective optimization goals. This new family
   of AI driven algorithms powered by Odin, our advanced AI, will be made
   available through Dynamic CPM with added granular optimization options.
   Live Screenshot from the Platform

   While Adform’s Dynamic CPM shares some characteristics with other “bid
   shading” algorithms on the market, we’ve focused on creating a more
   strategic approach providing added control, refinement, and flexibility
   specifically tailored to clients’ goals.
   Cost Savings

   Dynamic CPM is a family of programmatic optimization algorithms that
   helps customers to navigate ever changing programmatic auction
   dynamics. Unlike similar offers from other established DSPs, Dynamic
   CPM can deal with multivariate optimization – both predict the optimal
   bid price and maximize the goal KPI.

   How does it work?

   Dynamic CPM reviews billions of historical bids and related bid
   characteristics drawn from across the platform and our extended
   ecosystem. Bolstered by the rich signals we capture through our
   integrated advertising platform, we’re better positioned to apply our
   advanced machine learning capabilities to filter, forecast, and adapt
   to make informed bids that maximize efficiency within the criteria set
   by a buyer.
   Bid Shading Illustration

   Dynamic CPM - like technologies, including bid shading, have become
   particularly popular in the last 12 months to coincide with the
   depreciation of 2^nd price auctions through key auction mechanisms.
   Where, in a second price auction environment, optimal bid price was
   established by two competing bids and then the selection of the
   2^nd highest bid+1 cent, first price auctions mandate that the pricing
   decision is moved earlier in the process. The need for this stems from
   increased complexity in auction dynamics and the overall supply chain
   introduced by header bidding and other like-kind setups.

   With Dynamic CPM you retain the ability to set a flexible price range
   with a ceiling value you’re willing to pay. But, instead of relying on
   the increasingly jumbled rat’s nest of the bidding landscape that might
   deliver the optimal second price, or might forfeit a bid to
   preferential or parallel buying, the system predicts potential
   efficacy, optimizes for lowest price with a high probability of
   converting, and then optimizes in real time to deliver the optimal
   price.

   Dynamic CPM provides added benefits by supplementing pure CPM based
   optimization options, with additional dynamic elements that are of
   increasing importance to your ad buys such as viewability and video
   completion rates.

   AI Empowered Excellence

   Adform’s Dynamic CPM algorithm is part of Odin, Adform’s advanced AI.
   The algorithm is trained multiple times throughout the day using
   historical pricing and performance data collected for each domain, URL,
   placement, device, supply partner, user id, and assigned creative type
   leveraging data from across our integrated advertising platform.

   In addition to dealing with supply data, the algorithm also
   incorporates campaign specific budget restrictions in order to achieve
   pricing, performance and pacing KPIs. As an algorithm’s performance is
   only as good as the data that it is trained on, this means our Dynamic
   CPM benefits from the robust scope of Adform’s integrated advertising
   platform delivering superior data insights.

   Based on historical data points and statistical trends, the algorithm
   is able to predict the optimal bid price to submit for each auction.
   Optimal, in this context, is defined as the minimal price predicted to
   be sufficient to win a given auction. In addition, if the trader also
   chooses to optimize towards viewability or video completion rate, the
   final bid price will be adjusted by multiplying it by the probability
   of the display impression being viewable or the video impression being
   viewed to completion.

   What Does the Beta Designation Mean?

   While the majority of alternatives on the market focus exclusively on
   core bid shading capabilities for the specific goal of establishing an
   optimal price for CPM based bidding, we believe there’s much more
   potential. As a company with a special positioning due to the data, and
   real-time characteristics of our integrated advertising platform, we’re
   able to do more with our machine learning capabilities. This means that
   we see Dynamic CPM as far more than a pure bid shading algorithm. We
   see it as a powerful tool for establishing dynamic pricing tailored to
   the complexity and broad needs of the modern programmatic landscape.

   At launch, our Dynamic CPM algorithm has the stability, capabilities,
   features, and effectiveness of all of our other products. It delivers
   performance and reliability benchmarked on par with, or better than,
   all other leading alternatives on the market and will deliver excellent
   results. As with all of our advanced machine learning driven
   algorithms, we also continually tweak, test, and improve the
   performance of the algorithm to ensure it continually increases in the
   value its able to deliver to customers.

   However, we’re not quite ready to say it’s done because we believe
   there’s a better way to move things beyond the current status quo. Over
   the coming months, while in Beta, we’ll be testing potential hybrid
   environments, additional algorithms to be merged and incorporated
   adding alternate goals, UX enhancements, and to better discover the
   primary pain points clients need solved.  Throughout the Beta Dynamic
   CPM is and will remain free. But, as we explore new use cases, combine
   capabilities, and drive industry innovation through new goals while
   expanding advanced machine learning capabilities we reserve the
   possibility of revising pricing.

   Ready to Start Using Dynamic CPM?

   You can start buying with Dynamic CPM from today in the Adform DSP.

   If you still don’t see Dynamic CPM (or other functions mentioned here)
   under your account, please reach out to your account manager or central
   client services ([email protected]).

   To learn more about Dynamic CPM, join us for our free introductory
   webinar taking place June 17th at 15:00 CEST, 14:00 BST, 09:00 EST.

Introducing DCO Pro

   A Smarter Breed of DCO Technology
   Thought Leadership
   Share
   June 05, 2019

   In the same way the assembly line revolutionized automotive
   manufacturing, dynamic creative has been instrumental in re-shaping the
   boundaries of tailored creative. Adform is fundamentally focused on
   enhancing your ability to deliver and scale tailored ads while
   optimizing for enhanced performance. This means a dedicated focus on
   better efficiency, easier strategy execution across multi-dimensional
   activation points, and fully harnessing the benefits of an integrated
   trading, data, and creative platform.

   A commitment to creative has always been a core part of our journey.
   When benchmarked by industry research like Gartner and Forrester, we
   consistently score at the forefront of creative platforms paired with a
   full suite of activation technologies. However, even beyond this, the
   ability to deploy and inform the delivery mechanism through our
   creative tools, backed by the full weight and synergies of the world’s
   most robust integrated advertising platform, is a true market
   differentiator.

   To support our continued dedication to our creative offering, we are
   delighted to introduce Adform DCO Pro. DCO Pro unifies our existing
   Dynamic Ads, Product Retargeting, and advanced Hybrid Solutions
   offerings under a single product umbrella. With the launch of DCO Pro,
   we are releasing a set of new features for Dynamic Ads, as well as a
   host of enhancements to the core architecture driving our Dynamic
   Creative Optimization products and tools.

   In internal testing with alpha clients, we have already seen DCO Pro
   deliver significant cost and efficiency savings while helping clients
   identify top performing messaging and creatives.
   DCO Pro Benchmark Results

   While most DCO offerings on the market solve your basic needs as a
   client by supporting creative production efficiency, moderate to
   advanced personalization and general optimization options, we believe
   in delivering a better solution that closes the gap between you and
   clear results.

Key Benefits When You Choose Adform DCO Pro

   A truly unified creative and trading strategy
     * Creative decisioning is fully connected with Trading (DSP) and a
       broader Ad Server, allowing a uniform strategy execution opposed to
       disconnected targeting and execution strategies, difficulties in
       maintaining such complex setups and discrepancies. We know clients
       want flexibility, but also to simplify the number of vendors,
       data-handoffs, and contracts needed. Our ability to service your
       creative’s full journey without sacrificing features delivers
       operational and organizational simplicity while delivering
       significant time savings.

   Data-driven execution across the funnel and the user journey
     * We provided an unparalleled ability to integrate data management
       and activation capabilities. This allows DCO Pro users to pair
       real-time and historical campaign data with 1^st and 3^rd party and
       trading data in a single tool, allowing consistent communication
       that spans across multiple-campaigns for more strategic execution.

   Cross-format, Channel and Device support
     * We believe it is our role to deliver better ways for our clients to
       execute truly personalized campaigns across a wide range of
       different media and channels with as wide a collection of creative
       forms as possible. This is an on-going process, but DCO Pro, backed
       by the Integrated Advertising Platform is at the forefront of
       closing these gaps and delivering a fully empowered experience.

   Simple user experience for better execution
     * We have flattened the user experience with a focus on delivering
       extensive options in as few steps as possible. This allows you to
       take care of all of your primary tasks in a single central place,
       making it easy to create and manage your DCO driven campaigns.

   Superior Product Retargeting solution
     * In addition to Dynamic Ads, we also provide a more powerful and
       efficient mass versioning solution for product and service
       retargeting which can automatically ingest large sets of product
       items and rank, retarget, recommend in each impression based on
       browsing history and intention.

   Hybrid Capabilities
     * The ability to pair the adaptive logic of Adform Product
       Retargeting with the scaled optimization and customization
       capabilities of Adform Dynamic Ads brings an enhanced level of
       flexibility that opens up a wide range of new possibilities.

Do More With Adform Signals

   Adform Signals is a hyper-connection between our DSP, Ad Server and DCO
   Pro products. It bridges the gap between trading and creative tools
   with a focus on servicing the complexities of real-life use cases.
   Signals does away with the need for highly manual processes and
   duplicate steps when mapping and managing campaigns between DSP and Ad
   Server. It does this while extending creative decision-making
   capabilities beyond the standard targeting options available in the
   market. DCO Pro allows users to connect decision-making capabilities to
   trading parameters such as budgets, capping, hyper-local, inventory,
   and more.

The Engine Driving Your DCO Matters

   Adform’s position as the industry’s only fully-fledged independent
   advertising platform delivers unique advantages through advanced
   Machine Learning. This gives us added capabilities compared to
   individual standalone solutions or traditional “full stack” technology
   offerings which are lacking one or more key pillars such as an Ad
   Server or Data Management Platform. The unified underlying nature of
   our technology also allows us to tap into and train based on the
   extensive data that results. In the same way that a child grows smarter
   with the more data he/she learns from, an algorithm is only as good as
   the sum of the data it's exposed to. Richer data sets make for better
   AI performance, leading to better decisions and an immediate benefit to
   your campaigns.

   As Adform is an integrated advertising platform with Ad serving, DSP,
   DMP, web analytics, SSP, and other related tools, we see far more user
   IDs and interactions globally than the majority of ad-tech solutions.
   We also go one step further, meeting the gold standard for measurement
   in the industry with MRC accredited support for key pieces of our
   measurement methodology and metrics.

   Every month, this results in billions of data points, including
   anonymized and compliant onsite data, which fuels our algorithms. This
   data is then used to establish our general baseline or "big data
   signals" to feed the algorithms used for decisioning,
   auto-optimization, lookalike modeling, fraud detection, inventory
   forecasting, bid landscaping, and audience affinity tools in the
   platform.

   Adform DCO Pro harnesses this data, seamlessly informing both creative
   and auction decisioning. From there, our Machine Learning algorithms
   then optimize on a more local level to track your individual banner and
   campaign performance, helping you measure and optimize while delivering
   quality and relevance to your ideal prospects.

A DCO Driven Future

   We’ve also launched a new DCO Pro roadmap with an emphasis on further
   solving your needs as an advertiser in three core areas:

   Cross Channel, Format and Device support – Effective real-time message
   decisioning requires the ability to scale and bridge the gaps that
   currently exist between technologies, formats, and media. Current
   market solutions do not sufficiently address this. DCO Pro is focused
   on delivering a solution that goes far beyond the existing status quo
   and builds for a media and channel rich future.

   Strategic logic – At the heart of the powerful creatives of the future
   is the ability to refine further and customize the strategic logic
   shaping when, how, and where messages are displayed. We’re focused on
   an active capability that takes into consideration tools like Boolean
   logic and negative targeting that help you master exactly who does (or
   doesn’t) see your creative messages.

   Enhanced intelligence - Integrated heatmaps and decision trees are only
   the tip of the iceberg when it comes to enhanced insights and
   intelligence. Tools that make it easier to understand how your
   campaigns are performing, how to optimize them further, and how to
   maximize the opportunities that powerful creative surfaces directly
   translate into efficiency gains for clients.

New Features in DCO Pro

   Adform DCO Pro includes all of the core capabilities of our earlier
   Dynamic Ads, Product Retargeting, and Hybrid offerings, which were
   already some of the most powerful integrated tools on the market.
   However, at launch, DCO Pro pairs new backend enhancements with the
   following exciting new capabilities:
     * Expansion of our cross-device and channel support with new Rich
       Media and Mobile MRAID capabilities for your dynamic ads campaigns,
       with Video VAST format support and cross-device targeting to

The Amazon and Sizmek Rumors Are True, but Questions Remain

   Thought Leadership
   Share
   June 19, 2019

   The following piece is a follow-up on my previous note April 3rd.

   Most recently, industry insiders have been abuzz speculating who would
   acquire Sizmek’s remaining assets including its ad server and dynamic
   creative optimization platform. Of these, you probably heard rumors
   that the front runner was a company starting with the letter ‘A’.  By
   now, the secret is out that it’s not Adform – which is perhaps less of
   a surprise to some as we’ve always been very clear that we prefer to
   build our tech from the ground up as this delivers better results.

   Recently Amazon confirmed what many of us were expecting, it had
   acquired Sizmek’s remaining assets. We’re glad to see Sizmek’s core
   assets find a new home and hope that the acquisition will safeguard
   many of the jobs that had been put at risk following the administration
   news. We’ve also long considered Sizmek’s ad serving technology to be a
   strong asset and one that had historically helped maintain a healthy
   independent ecosystem. Amazon’s decision to pick up Sizmek also further
   goes to show that ad serving is still very much a strategic asset and
   continues to hold a fundamental place in the market.

   Theoretically, this puts Amazon in a much better position to compete
   with Google for advertiser budgets. A trend which we welcome as
   supporters of a fair and thriving ecosystem, in which diversity and
   competition is essential.  But, there are still some questions that
   remain to be answered.

   The biggest of which is how Amazon plans to integrate Sizmek into its
   platform, or whether it will keep it as a standalone product. Based on
   what we know so far, the speed of the acquisition, and historical
   examples, it’s very likely that Amazon will use the former Sizmek
   assets to bolster its own stack. In such cases the new organization
   usually enjoys a brief period of autonomy before attempts at
   integration begin ending with the eventual shutdown of the original
   company assets within 12-36 months. With Amazon’s strong incentives to
   continue to focus on keeping customers within its own walled garden
   environment, attempts at a rapid integration into their wider
   advertising services seems inevitable.

   This will ultimately limit choice for advertisers and may not be well
   received by agencies and brands. Particularly for those that have a
   vested concern about enriching Amazon’s sales data to their own
   detriment. For others that were drawn to Sizmek because of their media
   agnostic nature, Amazon’s existing portfolio of companies and ongoing
   aggressive acquisitions and constant expansion into new industries is a
   source of significant concern. Prime examples of this are Amazon’s
   recently announced forays into travel/hospitality and cellular/mobile.

   One of Sizmek’s biggest selling points, and something we also are
   passionately about, is the need for an independent, third party ad
   server. Although Amazon will be empowered to face Google, limiting the
   ecosystem to one walled garden vs. another will only stifle innovation,
   harm transparency and further impact creativity.

   Additionally, when larger tech companies are in the acquisition seat,
   the acquired technology often suffers, falling victim to an unspoken
   trend of ‘buy now, worry about the plan to integrate later’.  And we
   have seen the dire consequences of this in the past with Atlas.
   Acquired by Microsoft in 2007, it was later sold at a loss to Facebook,
   who stripped primary talent and functionality, and closed it down three
   years after buying it. This highlights the challenges faced with
   integrating technologies. Just as the ease with which Sizmek’s
   partially integrated DSP and DMP capabilities were rapidly spun back
   off and sold piecemeal despite over a year of integration efforts.

   For brands unwilling to roll the dice, or which have previously made
   the strategic decision to focus on media-agnostic technology, we remain
   well positioned to support.

   Adform remains the industry’s premier independent ad server at scale.
   More than that, we have the industry’s only truly integrated
   advertising platform that has the modularity and individual flexibility
   to choose the ideal product configuration. We have a long history of
   creative excellence and proven track record as DCO experts re-affirmed
   by our recently launched DCO Pro offering.

   We’re ready, scaled, and have the footprint to easily transition
   clients while taking up the slack and reducing disruption.
