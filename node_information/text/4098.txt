About this bundle

   [ ]

   Introducing the Hand Drawn Display Bundle by Adam Ladd, a collection of
   32 unique fonts ideal for headlines that call for a human touch. There
   are a range of styles to choose from—script, sans, serif,
   ornaments—that can be mixed and matched to fit the need. The common
   thread for all of them is that they’ve been created by hand. The
   organic, craftsman qualities are evident at large sizes, but they have
   also been carefully drawn to keep readability in mind.

   Whether it’s food packaging, a headline for publishing in books and
   magazines, or a lifestyle brand and website, these fonts will be a
   useful toolkit to add typographic expression to your designs.
