     “We started working with Adform more than 4 years ago and today
     their technical setup is seamlessly integrated into our Deutsche
     Telekom Digital Blueprint. This gives us the transparency and
     control that we demand over data management and media buying, across
     all our digital marketing channels. We recently reviewed and changed
     our paid media ecosystem to future-proof our media operations, which
     culminated in the implementation of a new Media Operating Model. The
     goal of the new Model is to increase our active guardianship and
     control over the Group’s paid media placements and outcomes. Adform
     is a crucial component of this Model as they provide the
     flexibility, expertise and dedication to support us in our goal.”

GDPR Overview

WHAT IS THE GDPR?

   The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a new data
   protection regulation in the European Economic Area (EEA) replacing
   Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC (Data Protection Directive) which
   was designed to harmonize data compliance requirements across the EEA
   and protect all EU citizens' data privacy, effective from May 25, 2018.

WHO DOES THE GDPR APPLY TO?

   The GDPR applies to all organizations established in the EEA and to
   organizations, whether or not established in the EEA, that process the
   personal data of EEA data subjects in connection with either the
   offering of goods or services to EEA data subjects or the monitoring of
   behavior that takes place within the EEA.

WHAT DOES THE GDPR REQUIRE?

   The GDPR lays out responsibilities for organizations to ensure the
   privacy and protection of personal data, as well as providing certain
   rights to data subjects.

   Some of the key privacy and data protection requirements of the GDPR
   include:
     * Incorporating organizational and technical mechanisms to protect
       personal data in the design of new systems and processes
     * Requiring the consent of subjects for data processing where user
       consent is the lawful basis for certain business practices
     * Requiring certain companies to appoint a data protection officer
       (DPO) to oversee GDPR compliance
     * Providing data breach notifications
     * Safely handling the transfer of data across borders

HOW DID ADFORM PREPARE FOR GDPR?

   In preparation for GDPR, Adform closely analyzed the requirements of
   the GDPR and implemented enhancements to its products, processes, and
   policies on an on-going basis. In the lead up to, and the period after
   GDPR went into effect, Adform has worked to support our clients and
   partners in their own GDPR compliance initiatives.
   In addition, Adform prepared and implemented new Data Processing
   Agreements (DPAs) designed to meet requirements outlined by the GDPR.

   Adform is ISO 27001 certified annually which demonstrates that the data
   security and processes required by the GDPR are in place.

   Adform is in an a-typical position as we as a company have always had
   the policy of only processing pseudonymous data which means that no
   directly identifiable data is allowed onto the platform. The platform
   automatically rejects data like names, emails, phone numbers and
   similar data. The database is scanned daily for violation by algorithms
   as well as manually. Furthermore, several measures like IP truncation
   are also enforced automatically and through violation scans.

   Adform has actively enforced policies to avoid sensitive data. Adform
   fully support opt-out frameworks and provide full disclosure of
   Adform's activities to clients and data subjects.

Privacy Center Overview

   and exercises your rights as a data subject. You can also learn more

   The GDPR applies to all organizations established in the EEA and to
   organizations, whether or not established in the EEA, that process the
   personal data of EEA data subjects in connection with either the
   offering of goods or services to EEA data subjects or the monitoring of
   behavior that takes place within the EEA.

WHAT DOES THE GDPR REQUIRE?

   The GDPR lays out responsibilities for organizations to ensure the
   privacy and protection of personal data, as well as providing certain
   rights to data subjects.

   Some of the key privacy and data protection requirements of the GDPR
   include:
     * Incorporating organizational and technical mechanisms to protect
       personal data in the design of new systems and processes
     * Requiring the consent of subjects for data processing where user
       consent is the lawful basis for certain business practices
     * Requiring certain companies to appoint a data protection officer
       (DPO) to oversee GDPR compliance
     * Providing data breach notifications
     * Safely handling the transfer of data across borders

HOW DID ADFORM PREPARE FOR GDPR?

   In preparation for GDPR, Adform closely analyzed the requirements of
   the GDPR and implemented enhancements to its products, processes, and
   policies on an on-going basis. In the lead up to, and the period after
   GDPR went into effect, Adform has worked to support our clients and
   partners in their own GDPR compliance initiatives.
   In addition, Adform prepared and implemented new Data Processing
   Agreements (DPAs) designed to meet requirements outlined by the GDPR.

   Adform is ISO 27001 certified annually which demonstrates that the data
   security and processes required by the GDPR are in place.

   Adform is in an a-typical position as we as a company have always had
   the policy of only processing pseudonymous data which means that no
   directly identifiable data is allowed onto the platform. The platform
   automatically rejects data like names, emails, phone numbers and
   similar data. The database is scanned daily for violation by algorithms
   as well as manually. Furthermore, several measures like IP truncation
   are also enforced automatically and through violation scans.

   Adform has actively enforced policies to avoid sensitive data. Adform
   fully support opt-out frameworks and provide full disclosure of
   Adform's activities to clients and data subjects.
