Welcome to the Privacy Shield

   The EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks were designed by
   the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Commission and Swiss
   Administration to provide companies on both sides of the Atlantic with
   a mechanism to comply with data protection requirements when
   transferring personal data from the European Union and Switzerland to
   the United States in support of transatlantic commerce.
