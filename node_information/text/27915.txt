                       Materials Science Support Lab.

   The Materials Science Support Lab. provides support to enable European
   materials engineers to make the best use of the advanced neutron and
   synchrotron X-ray scientific facilities at ILL-ESRF.

   The Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL) and the European Synchrotron Radiation
   Facility (ESRF) are respectively the leading European centres for
   research using neutron and synchrotron X-ray beams. They share a joint
   site in Grenoble, France, and provide advanced research facilities for
   users from European universities, research institutes and industries.

   The laboratory supports a variety of materials engineering
   applications. New users are helped to plan, undertake and evaluate
   experiments, and are assisted with data collection, processing and
   analysis. Industrial users can additionally be provided with a full
   measurement and data analysis service if required.

D17 - Neutron reflectometer with horizontal scattering geometry

   D17, is a neutron reflectometer with horizontal scattering geometry
   (vertical surfaces) designed to be as flexible as possible in
   resolution and modes of operation. It is suitable for the study of
   surface structures in solids and solid/liquid interfaces over a wide
   range of length scales.

Applications

     * The study of surfaces and buried interfaces of thin solid films and
       multilayers
     * Solid-liquid interfaces and membranes
     * Examination of off-specular reflectivity from atomic and magnetic
       in-plane structure
     * Kinetic studies of interface evolution.

Instrument layout

   D17 operates in four modes:
     * Time-of-flight (TOF), non-polarised
       This is achieved by a double chopper system using wavelengths from
       2 to 27 Å with great flexibility in resolution. This mode can
       simultaneously cover an order of magnitude in q in less than a
       minute, allowing the time evolution of a sample to be followed
       (kinetics). TOF-GISANS is also possible.
     * Time-of-flight (TOF), polarised beam
       This is achieved by using an S-bender polarising the TOF beam in a
       selectable wavelength range with high polarisation. Pol TOF-GISANS
       and kinetic studies also possible.
     * Monochromatic, non-polarised
       The non-poarised angle dispersive mode (high flux at 5.5 Å used
       over the entire q-range). Not suitable for kinetic studies as each
       point in q must be measured sequentially. GISANS possible.
     * Monochromatic, polarised beam
       For the study of magnetic samples with a choice of polarisation
       analysis between a supermirror for the specular beam and a 3He cell
       covering the wide solid angle of the multidetector for off-specular
       studies. The instrument is ideal for the measurement of
       off-specular scattering arising from large scale in-plane
       structure, glancing incidence small angle scattering (GISANS) from
       smaller scale in-plane structure.

What is the ILL

Unique facilities and cutting-edge expertise

   The Institut Laue-Langevin is an international research centre at the
   leading edge of neutron science and technology.

   As the world’s flagship centre for neutron science, the ILL provides
   scientists with a very high flux of neutrons feeding some 40
   state-of-the-art instruments, which are constantly being developed and
   upgraded.

   As a service institute the ILL makes its facilities and expertise
   available to visiting scientists. Every year, about 1400 researchers
   from over 40 countries visit the ILL and 640 experiments selected by a
   scientific review committee are performed. Research focuses primarily
   on fundamental science in a variety of fields: condensed matter
   physics, chemistry, biology, nuclear physics and materials science,
   etc.

   Whilst some are working on engine designs, fuels, plastics and
   household products, others are looking at biological processes at
   cellular and molecular level.  Still others may be elucidating the
   physics that could contribute to the electronic devices of the future.
   ILL can specially tailor its neutron beams to probe the fundamental
   processes that help to explain how our universe came into being, why it
   looks the way it does today and how it can sustain life.
   The ILL also collaborates closely and at different levels of
   confidentiality with the R&D departments of industrial enterprises.

   All the scientists at the ILL - chemists, physicists, biologists,
   crystallographers, specialists in magnetism and nuclear physics - are
   also experts in neutron research and technology and their combined
   know-how is made available to the scientific community.

   ILL is funded and managed by France, Germany and the United Kingdom, in
   partnership with 10 other countries.
