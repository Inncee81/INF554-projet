   This anaesthesia consultation, which should ideally take place 3 weeks
   before your surgery, is compulsory.

   During this anaesthesia consultation, the anaesthesiologist will assess
   your medical condition and discuss with you the most appropriate
   anaesthesia method for the surgical or radiological procedure you are
   to undergo. Our pain management options will also be explained to you.

   The anaesthesiologist will outline the risks related to anaesthesia to
   you and ask you to give your consent to this treatment by signing an
   "anaesthesia consent form".

   In the event of a surgical or neuroradiological procedure involving a
   bleeding risk, the anaesthesiologist will provide you with specific
   information about blood transfusions. Once again, you will be asked to
   indicate your consent to a transfusion if required by signing a
   "transfusion procedure consent form".

   Please note: For surgery involving a bleeding risk, your refusal to
   sign the "transfusion procedure consent form" for whatever religious or
   philosophical reason, will automatically lead to the surgery being
   cancelled.

   Vertebral conditions (in particular lumbar sciatica due to a herniated
   disc or other causes)
   Chronic Inflammatory Rheumatoid diseases, primarily including
   Rheumatoid Arthritis and Ankylosing Spondylitis.

   General systemic diseases, which are diseases affecting several organs
   simultaneously or consecutively and which may be detected, in
   particular, as a result of eye, brain or nerve involvement. The
   majority of these are uncommon but potentially very serious diseases,
   such as:  acute disseminated lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis,
   Sarcoidosis, Systemic vasculitis (Wegener's disease, Churg-Strauss
   syndrome, etc.), Chronic atrophic polychondritis, Polymyositis and
   dermatomyositis, etc.

Cardiology Unit

   Aetiological assessment of ischaemic strokes (patients treated in the
   neurovascular unit, intensive care and interventional neuroradiology
   department) and for preoperative assessment prior to non-cardiac
   surgery.

   Management of hospitalised cardiac patients or patients presenting a
   cardiac problem during their hospital stay.

Endocrinology

   Management of endocrinological problems (diabetes, hormonal
   disturbances) that may emerge during a hospital stay. In particular,
   the department monitors the hormone levels of Neurosurgery Department
   patients undergoing surgical procedures on the pituitary gland, which
   secretes hormones essential to numerous, and sometimes vital, metabolic
   functions. Thyroid diseases detected as a result of eye diseases
   (Graves' disease, for example) may also be concerned. Follow-up
   consultations are provided for Thyroid and Pituitary conditions.

Ophtalmology Emergencies

The ophthalmology emergencies department

   Emergencies at the A. de Rothschild Foundation are open 24 hours a day
   for people with a recent visual problem, regardless of age, children
   and adults, excluding loss or breakage of spectacle lenses.

   The reception is done by the emergency nurse who specifies the reason
   for consultation: decreased visual acuity, double vision, pain, redness
   or swelling of the eye, abrupt drooping eyelid or other problem after
   trauma or accidental projection in the eye. With this interrogation,
   the establishment of an order of passage in consultation is possible,
   according to the degree of gravity.

   Children are given priority, whenever possible.

   Our emergencies benefit from the constant presence of an
   ophthalmologist. In case of immediate surgical emergency, the
   intervention is carried out on site, after medical advice, day and
   night, in children as in adults.

   Specific problems can be dealt with by practitioners specializing in
   the discipline concerned: it is thus an ophthalmologist specializing in
   the retina who takes care of and operates the detachments of the
   retina.

   The ophtalmology emergencies department works in partnership with the
   other non-ophthalmological departments of the A. de Rothschild
   Foundation: neurology, adult and children neurosurgery, ENT, internal
   medicine and the medical imaging department, which includes a scanner
   and two MRI.
