Tech Policy / AI Ethics

Establishing an AI code of ethics will be harder than people think

Ethics are too subjective to guide the use of AI, argue some legal scholars.

   A time line of tech events that raise ethical questions, presented at
   the opening of the AI Now 2018 Symposium.
   Varoon Mathur/AI Now Institute

   Over the past six years, the New York City police department has
   compiled a massive database containing the names and personal details
   of at least 17,500 individuals it believes to be involved in criminal
   gangs. The effort has already been criticized by civil rights activists
   who say it is inaccurate and racially discriminatory.

   "Now imagine marrying facial recognition technology to the development
   of a database that theoretically presumes you’re in a gang," Sherrilyn
   Ifill, president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense fund,
   said at the AI Now Symposium in New York last Tuesday.

   Lawyers, activists, and researchers emphasize the need for ethics and
   accountability in the design and implementation of AI systems. But this
   often ignores a couple of tricky questions: who gets to define those
   ethics, and who should enforce them?
   Sherrilyn Ifill (NAACP Legal Defense Fund), Timnit Gebru (Google), and
   Nicole Ozer (ACLU) in conversation at the AI Now 2018 Symposium.
   Andrew Federman for AI Now Institute

   Not only is facial recognition imperfect, studies have shown that the
   leading software is less accurate for dark-skinned individuals and
   women. By Ifill’s estimation, the police database is between 95 and 99
   percent African American, Latino, and Asian American. "We are talking
   about creating a class of […] people who are branded with a kind of
   criminal tag," Ifill said.

   Meanwhile, police departments across the US, the UK, and China have
   begun adopting face recognition as a tool for finding known criminals.
   In June, the South Wales police released a statement justifying their
   use of the technology because of the "public benefit" that it provides.

   Indeed, technology often highlights peoples' differing ethical
   standards—whether it is censoring hate speech or using risk assessment
   tools to improve public safety.

   The AI Now 2018 Symposium
   AI Now Institute

   In an attempt to highlight how divergent people’s principles can be,
   researchers at MIT created a platform called the Moral Machine to
   crowd-source human opinion on the moral decisions that should be
   followed by self-driving cars. They asked millions of people from
   around the world to weigh in on variations of the classic "trolley
   problem" by choosing who a car should try to prioritize in an accident.
   The results show huge variation across different cultures.

   Establishing ethical standards also doesn’t necessarily change
   behavior. In June, for example, after Google agreed to discontinue its
   work on Project Maven with the Pentagon, it established a fresh set of
   ethical principles to guide its involvement in future AI projects. Only
   months later, many Google employees feel those principles have been
   placed by the wayside with a bid for a $10 billion Department of
   Defense contract. A recent study out of North Carolina State University
   also found that asking software engineers to read a code of ethics does
   nothing to change their behavior.

   Philip Alston, an international legal scholar at NYU’s School of Law,
   proposes a solution to the ambiguous and unaccountable nature of
   ethics: reframing AI-driven consequences in terms of human rights.
   "[Human rights are] in the constitution," Alston said at the same
   conference. "They’re in the bill of rights; they’ve been interpreted by
   courts," he said. If an AI system takes away people’s basic rights,
   then it should not be acceptable, he said.

   Albany, SUNY), and Vincent Southerland (Center on Race, Inequality, and
   the Law at NYU) on stage at the symposium.

   Alston isn’t the only one who has come up with this solution. Less than
   a week before the Symposium, the Data & Society Research Institute
   published a proposal for using international human rights to govern AI.
   The report includes recommendations for tech companies to engage with
   civil rights groups and researchers, and to conduct human rights impact
   assessments on the life cycles of their AI systems.

   "Until we start bringing [human rights] into the AI discussion," added
   Alston, "there’s no hard anchor."

   The Industrial Revolution conjures up images of steam engines, textile
   mills, and iron workers. This was a defining period during the late
   18th and early 19th centuries, as society shifted from primarily
   agrarian to factory-based work. A second phase of rapid
   industrialization occurred just before World War I, driven by growth in
   steel and oil production, and the emergence of electricity.

   Fast-forward to the 1980s, when digital electronics started having a
   deep impact on society—the dawning Digital Revolution. Building on that
   era is what’s called the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Like its
   predecessors, it is centered on technological advancements—this time
   it’s artificial intelligence (AI), autonomous machines, and the
   internet of things—but now the focus is on how technology will affect
   society and humanity’s ability to communicate and remain connected.

   “In the first Industrial Revolution, we replaced brawn with steam. In
   the second, we replaced steam with electricity, and in the third, we
   introduced computers,” says Guido Jouret, chief digital officer for
   Swiss industrial corporation ABB. “We’ve had intelligent rule-based
   systems. What we haven’t had is the equivalent of the human
   cortex—systems that can learn.”

   That’s what AI technologies represent in the current period of
   technological change. It is now critical to carefully consider the
   future of AI, what it will look like, the effect it will have on human
   life, and what challenges and opportunities will arise as it evolves.

   Safety is of paramount importance for operating autonomous vehicles.
   That doesn’t mean the safety of just the riders and passengers, but
   also other vehicles on the road, pedestrians, and bicycle traffic. To
   gain widespread acceptance, safety issues must be resolved to the full
   satisfaction of the public. Getting a handle on safety means also
   taking on a thicket of technological, legal, and philosophical
   challenges.

Autonomous driving: Safety first

   Autonomous vehicles are going to be part of our transportation network.
   Most industry experts believe it is only a matter of time before
   they’re plying the roads in increasing numbers. “[Autonomous driving]
   will come, but it’s not going to be instantaneous,” says Judith
   Hurwitz, president and CEO of consultancy Hurwitz & Associates.
   “There’s not enough data yet to test everything and train on
   everything.”

   Just look at what the major automotive manufacturers are doing. General
   Motors recently invested $100 million in two manufacturing sites in
   Michigan to focus on rolling autonomous Cruise AVs off the line. Other
   major manufacturers, such as Ford, BMW, and Volvo, are similarly
   interested and invested in autonomous-vehicle programs.

   A time line of tech events that raise ethical questions, presented at
   the opening of the AI Now 2018 Symposium.
   Varoon Mathur/AI Now Institute

Tech Policy / AI Ethics

Establishing an AI code of ethics will be harder than people think

Ethics are too subjective to guide the use of AI, argue some legal scholars.

   by Karen Hao
   Oct 21, 2018
   A time line of tech events that raise ethical questions, presented at
   the opening of the AI Now 2018 Symposium.
   Varoon Mathur/AI Now Institute

   Over the past six years, the New York City police department has
   compiled a massive database containing the names and personal details
   of at least 17,500 individuals it believes to be involved in criminal
   gangs. The effort has already been criticized by civil rights activists
   who say it is inaccurate and racially discriminatory.

   "Now imagine marrying facial recognition technology to the development
   of a database that theoretically presumes you’re in a gang," Sherrilyn
   Ifill, president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense fund,
   said at the AI Now Symposium in New York last Tuesday.

   Lawyers, activists, and researchers emphasize the need for ethics and
   accountability in the design and implementation of AI systems. But this
   often ignores a couple of tricky questions: who gets to define those
   ethics, and who should enforce them?
   Sherrilyn Ifill (NAACP Legal Defense Fund), Timnit Gebru (Google), and
   Nicole Ozer (ACLU) in conversation at the AI Now 2018 Symposium.
   Andrew Federman for AI Now Institute

   Not only is facial recognition imperfect, studies have shown that the
   leading software is less accurate for dark-skinned individuals and
   women. By Ifill’s estimation, the police database is between 95 and 99
   percent African American, Latino, and Asian American. "We are talking
   about creating a class of […] people who are branded with a kind of
   criminal tag," Ifill said.

   Meanwhile, police departments across the US, the UK, and China have
   begun adopting face recognition as a tool for finding known criminals.
   In June, the South Wales police released a statement justifying their
   use of the technology because of the "public benefit" that it provides.

   Indeed, technology often highlights peoples' differing ethical
   standards—whether it is censoring hate speech or using risk assessment
   tools to improve public safety.

   The AI Now 2018 Symposium
   AI Now Institute

   In an attempt to highlight how divergent people’s principles can be,
   researchers at MIT created a platform called the Moral Machine to
   crowd-source human opinion on the moral decisions that should be
   followed by self-driving cars. They asked millions of people from
   around the world to weigh in on variations of the classic "trolley
   problem" by choosing who a car should try to prioritize in an accident.
   The results show huge variation across different cultures.

   Establishing ethical standards also doesn’t necessarily change
   behavior. In June, for example, after Google agreed to discontinue its
   work on Project Maven with the Pentagon, it established a fresh set of
   ethical principles to guide its involvement in future AI projects. Only
   months later, many Google employees feel those principles have been
   placed by the wayside with a bid for a $10 billion Department of
   Defense contract. A recent study out of North Carolina State University
   also found that asking software engineers to read a code of ethics does
   nothing to change their behavior.

   Philip Alston, an international legal scholar at NYU’s School of Law,
   proposes a solution to the ambiguous and unaccountable nature of
   ethics: reframing AI-driven consequences in terms of human rights.
   "[Human rights are] in the constitution," Alston said at the same
   conference. "They’re in the bill of rights; they’ve been interpreted by
   courts," he said. If an AI system takes away people’s basic rights,
   then it should not be acceptable, he said.
   Philip Alston (NYU School of Law), Virginia Eubanks (University at
   Albany, SUNY), and Vincent Southerland (Center on Race, Inequality, and
   the Law at NYU) on stage at the symposium.
   Andrew Federman for AI Now Institute

   Alston isn’t the only one who has come up with this solution. Less than
   a week before the Symposium, the Data & Society Research Institute
   published a proposal for using international human rights to govern AI.
   The report includes recommendations for tech companies to engage with
   civil rights groups and researchers, and to conduct human rights impact
   assessments on the life cycles of their AI systems.

   "Until we start bringing [human rights] into the AI discussion," added
   Alston, "there’s no hard anchor."

   The Industrial Revolution conjures up images of steam engines, textile
   mills, and iron workers. This was a defining period during the late
   18th and early 19th centuries, as society shifted from primarily
   agrarian to factory-based work. A second phase of rapid
   industrialization occurred just before World War I, driven by growth in
   steel and oil production, and the emergence of electricity.

   Fast-forward to the 1980s, when digital electronics started having a
   deep impact on society—the dawning Digital Revolution. Building on that
   era is what’s called the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Like its
   predecessors, it is centered on technological advancements—this time
   it’s artificial intelligence (AI), autonomous machines, and the
   internet of things—but now the focus is on how technology will affect
   society and humanity’s ability to communicate and remain connected.

   “In the first Industrial Revolution, we replaced brawn with steam. In
   the second, we replaced steam with electricity, and in the third, we
   introduced computers,” says Guido Jouret, chief digital officer for
   Swiss industrial corporation ABB. “We’ve had intelligent rule-based
   systems. What we haven’t had is the equivalent of the human
   cortex—systems that can learn.”

   That’s what AI technologies represent in the current period of
   technological change. It is now critical to carefully consider the
   future of AI, what it will look like, the effect it will have on human
   life, and what challenges and opportunities will arise as it evolves.

   Safety is of paramount importance for operating autonomous vehicles.
   That doesn’t mean the safety of just the riders and passengers, but
   also other vehicles on the road, pedestrians, and bicycle traffic. To
   gain widespread acceptance, safety issues must be resolved to the full
   satisfaction of the public. Getting a handle on safety means also
   taking on a thicket of technological, legal, and philosophical
   challenges.

Autonomous driving: Safety first

   Autonomous vehicles are going to be part of our transportation network.
   Most industry experts believe it is only a matter of time before
   they’re plying the roads in increasing numbers. “[Autonomous driving]
   will come, but it’s not going to be instantaneous,” says Judith
   Hurwitz, president and CEO of consultancy Hurwitz & Associates.
   “There’s not enough data yet to test everything and train on
   everything.”

   Just look at what the major automotive manufacturers are doing. General
   Motors recently invested $100 million in two manufacturing sites in
   Michigan to focus on rolling autonomous Cruise AVs off the line. Other
   major manufacturers, such as Ford, BMW, and Volvo, are similarly
   interested and invested in autonomous-vehicle programs.
