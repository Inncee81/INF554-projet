We Tried the Silver-Infused Underwear That ‘Doesn’t Need Washing for Weeks’

   By Lori Keong and Jason Chen

   Welcome to Underwear Week, where we’re talking all things underwear,
   from practical — like granny panties or red-carpet-tested invisible
   underwear — to the kind you wear with that special someone.

   Welcome to Underwear Week, where we’re talking all things underwear,
   from practical — like granny panties or red-carpet-tested invisible
   underwear — to the kind you wear with that special someone.
   The Danish brand Organic Basics has a line of silver-infused underwear
   that supposedly fights odor and bacteria. Photo: Courtesy of the
   retailer

Women’s underwear

   My mother’s advice about hygiene is simple: Change your underwear every
   day (even on no-shower days), and so far it hasn’t led me astray. But
   for Underwear Week, I put my better judgment aside to call in and test
   Organic Basics’ new silver-coated underwear. Organic Basics claims that
   with silver’s antibacterial (and thus, odor-repelling) qualities, you
   can avoid wasting water and energy simply by wearing their undies more
   than once before washing. I had reservations going in since I’ve tried
   silver-laced pillowcases before and wasn’t impressed, but kept an open
   mind.

   I tested my undies — a hipster style that comes in a two-pack — over
   two days, which happened to be a beneficial time to test odor-repelling
   undies since (full disclosure!) I was also on the tail end of my
   period. While not terribly messy, per se, it is definitely a more
   pungent time than usual. Because an Organic Basics representative told
   me that silver is also heat-regulating, I put them through the wringer
   on my first day by attending a sweaty vinyasa class. I didn’t find them
   to be cooling, really, but at the end of the day, I felt like I smelled
   cleaner than I normally would, given the circumstances. That all
   shifted on my second day when I started noticing a less-than-fresh
   scent while I was out for the night, and while it didn’t reek, I didn’t
   feel comfortable pushing my luck with a third day of testing.

   The crux of the problem with undies that are “antibacterial” is that
   even if they’re reducing odor, they’re not magically self-cleaning, or
   even absorbent in the way Thinx “period-proof” underwear are, so it
   doesn’t change the fact that you’re sitting in two or three days’ worth
   of fabric that’s been brushing up against you — and your sweat and dead
   skin and general funk. And without any testing on the microscopic level
   to determine whether the underpants are actually killing bacteria,
   besides a non-scientific smell test, I think I’d rather toss them in
   the wash than tolerate repeat wears.

   That being said, they are still a good pair of underwear in and of
   themselves, odor-repelling or not. Since they’re made with
   silver-coated polyester thread (which are not supposed to wear out over
   time), the Organic Basics are heftier than the average pair — they look
   like they could take a beating in the washing machine — but still
   comfortable and have stretch to them. They’re nice for lounging, but
   with the thicker edges, I wouldn’t exactly call them VPL-resistant. I
   don’t recommend wearing them if you’re dealing with something like your
   period, but I almost wish these had been around in my college days for
   finals week (when showers were few and far between). I also imagine
   they would be ideal to pack in your bag for a music festival or camping
   trip, when you need all the odor-repelling you can get. — Lori Keong

And as for the men’s underwear

   When Alexis first told me about Danish underwear that stayed clean for
   weeks, I was skeptical. Even with the addition of anti-odor,
   antimicrobial silver fibers, fabric just isn’t meant to be in contact
   with a very intimate part of the body without getting a little … musty,
   no? So when I received my first pair of SilverTech boxer briefs, I
   wanted to dutifully test their stink-fighting abilities. I decided to
   wear them longer than I ordinarily would (Two days? Three? I’d read
   that they could last for weeks and was ready to ride this wave as long
   as I could). I wouldn’t wear them for workouts, which seemed like a
   too-aggressive move for non-exercise underwear. And each morning I’d
   conduct a sniff test to assess just how “good” I was.

   My first impressions of the boxer briefs: The cut isn’t as comfortable
   as my everyday Calvins. The waistband is flimsier and the legs (are
   they called legs on boxer briefs?) are just a bit shorter than I
   prefer. Something about the fabric felt scratchy, too, which I
   confirmed with Organic Basics is something you should expect with
   metal-lined underwear. I do have to say that on the second morning, I
   felt totally confident about wearing them again — they looked and felt
   and smelled like a fresh pair of underwear.

   Morning three is when things got dicey. SilverTech underwear past 48
   hours did not pass my smell test. I reached out to Organic Basics to
   ask what the deal was, and a very nice representative noted that, alas,
   the underwear doesn’t exactly “never” need washing: “It varies from
   person to person — some might feel the need to wash after just one
   wear, and others might want to go longer. To maximize the length of
   time before washing we recommend airing them a little overnight.” In
   fairness, I did not air them overnight, though I can’t imagine anyone
   who doesn’t sleep naked doing that. The verdict is that I could only
   stretch the wears from one day to two between washes, and while that
   doesn’t seem like very much, it does halve the amount of underwear
   you’d have to wash — and the amount you’d need to bring in a carry-on.

Photos: Offices in Silicon Valley That Are Way Better Than Yours

   By Kevin Roose

   09 Nov 2011, San Francisco, California, USA --- Arcade games and a
   foosball table: a common view at social gaming giant Zynga's
   headquarters in San Francisco. Employees are welcome to play, even
   during office hours. --- Image by ? Karsten Lemm/dpa/Corbis

   In the tech industry, free snacks and luxury shuttles are no longer
   enough. From putting greens to pod chairs, from Airbnb’s faux-pastoral
   living walls to Zynga’s game room, no expenses are being spared in the
   tech corridor’s arms race for office superiority. Some companies give
   out-of-office perks (Google employees can rent company shuttles at a
   discount for weekend parties), and some make do with catered lunches
   and Friday concerts.

   And why not? Silicon Valley has more money than it knows what to do
   with, and tech contains one of the most competitive labor markets in
   the country. If a hot-shot engineer can be wooed by the promise of a
   roof deck and an espresso bar, these renovations will pay for
   themselves and then some.

   It used to be that tech offices resembled middle-school playplaces —
   all air hockey and Nerf guns. Now the bright colors and ball pits have
   given way to faux-industrial setups and furniture that’s more likely to
   come from a salvage shop than a catalogue, the kind of enhancements
   that convey both riches and artsy sophistication.

   Not every tech company splurges on setting. (Amazon famously uses plain
   wooden doors as desks and cheap chairs for every employee, even CEO
   Jeff Bezos.) But among the big and soon-to-be-big tech companies of the
   Bay Area, there’s no stopping the trend. After all, these companies do
   need productive employees. If your boss can make work feel like a
   playplace, that’s even less of a reason to clock out.

   Juul appears to be in full-blown crisis

   E-cigarette maker Juul is shutting down broadcast, print and digital
   advertising and ending lobbying efforts in Washington as safety
   concerns over vaping intensify.

   The company on Wednesday said its CEO was stepping down and will be
   replaced by a senior executive from Altria, the maker of Marlboro.
   Altria took a 35% stake in Juul in December at a cost of $13 billion.

   Also on Wednesday, one month after announcing that they were in merger
   talks, the tobacco giants Altria and Philip Morris International said
   they were calling off those discussions.

   Juul has long pushed its e-cigarettes as an alternative for adults
   looking to wean themselves off tobacco products. But e-cigarettes have
   become popular among teenagers, and illnesses potentially linked to the
   product are on the rise.

We Tried the Silver-Infused Underwear That ‘Doesn’t Need Washing for Weeks’

   By Lori Keong and Jason Chen

   Welcome to Underwear Week, where we’re talking all things underwear,
   from practical — like granny panties or red-carpet-tested invisible
   underwear — to the kind you wear with that special someone.
   The Danish brand Organic Basics has a line of silver-infused underwear
   that supposedly fights odor and bacteria. Photo: Courtesy of the
   retailer

Women’s underwear

   My mother’s advice about hygiene is simple: Change your underwear every
   day (even on no-shower days), and so far it hasn’t led me astray. But
   for Underwear Week, I put my better judgment aside to call in and test
   Organic Basics’ new silver-coated underwear. Organic Basics claims that
   with silver’s antibacterial (and thus, odor-repelling) qualities, you
   can avoid wasting water and energy simply by wearing their undies more
   than once before washing. I had reservations going in since I’ve tried
   silver-laced pillowcases before and wasn’t impressed, but kept an open
   mind.

   I tested my undies — a hipster style that comes in a two-pack — over
   two days, which happened to be a beneficial time to test odor-repelling
   undies since (full disclosure!) I was also on the tail end of my
   period. While not terribly messy, per se, it is definitely a more
   pungent time than usual. Because an Organic Basics representative told
   me that silver is also heat-regulating, I put them through the wringer
   on my first day by attending a sweaty vinyasa class. I didn’t find them
   to be cooling, really, but at the end of the day, I felt like I smelled
   cleaner than I normally would, given the circumstances. That all
   shifted on my second day when I started noticing a less-than-fresh
   scent while I was out for the night, and while it didn’t reek, I didn’t
   feel comfortable pushing my luck with a third day of testing.

   The crux of the problem with undies that are “antibacterial” is that
   even if they’re reducing odor, they’re not magically self-cleaning, or
   even absorbent in the way Thinx “period-proof” underwear are, so it
   doesn’t change the fact that you’re sitting in two or three days’ worth
   of fabric that’s been brushing up against you — and your sweat and dead
   skin and general funk. And without any testing on the microscopic level
   to determine whether the underpants are actually killing bacteria,
   besides a non-scientific smell test, I think I’d rather toss them in
   the wash than tolerate repeat wears.

   That being said, they are still a good pair of underwear in and of
   themselves, odor-repelling or not. Since they’re made with
   silver-coated polyester thread (which are not supposed to wear out over
   time), the Organic Basics are heftier than the average pair — they look
   like they could take a beating in the washing machine — but still
   comfortable and have stretch to them. They’re nice for lounging, but
   with the thicker edges, I wouldn’t exactly call them VPL-resistant. I
   don’t recommend wearing them if you’re dealing with something like your
   period, but I almost wish these had been around in my college days for
   finals week (when showers were few and far between). I also imagine
   they would be ideal to pack in your bag for a music festival or camping
   trip, when you need all the odor-repelling you can get. — Lori Keong

And as for the men’s underwear

   When Alexis first told me about Danish underwear that stayed clean for
   weeks, I was skeptical. Even with the addition of anti-odor,
   antimicrobial silver fibers, fabric just isn’t meant to be in contact
   with a very intimate part of the body without getting a little … musty,
   no? So when I received my first pair of SilverTech boxer briefs, I
   wanted to dutifully test their stink-fighting abilities. I decided to
   wear them longer than I ordinarily would (Two days? Three? I’d read
   that they could last for weeks and was ready to ride this wave as long
   as I could). I wouldn’t wear them for workouts, which seemed like a
   too-aggressive move for non-exercise underwear. And each morning I’d
   conduct a sniff test to assess just how “good” I was.

   My first impressions of the boxer briefs: The cut isn’t as comfortable
   as my everyday Calvins. The waistband is flimsier and the legs (are
   they called legs on boxer briefs?) are just a bit shorter than I
   prefer. Something about the fabric felt scratchy, too, which I
   confirmed with Organic Basics is something you should expect with
   metal-lined underwear. I do have to say that on the second morning, I
   felt totally confident about wearing them again — they looked and felt
   and smelled like a fresh pair of underwear.

   Morning three is when things got dicey. SilverTech underwear past 48
   hours did not pass my smell test. I reached out to Organic Basics to
   ask what the deal was, and a very nice representative noted that, alas,
   the underwear doesn’t exactly “never” need washing: “It varies from
   person to person — some might feel the need to wash after just one
   wear, and others might want to go longer. To maximize the length of
   time before washing we recommend airing them a little overnight.” In
   fairness, I did not air them overnight, though I can’t imagine anyone
   who doesn’t sleep naked doing that. The verdict is that I could only
   stretch the wears from one day to two between washes, and while that
   doesn’t seem like very much, it does halve the amount of underwear
   you’d have to wash — and the amount you’d need to bring in a carry-on.

We Tried the Silver-Infused Underwear That ‘Doesn’t Need Washing for Weeks’

   By Lori Keong and Jason Chen

   Welcome to Underwear Week, where we’re talking all things underwear,
   from practical — like granny panties or red-carpet-tested invisible
   underwear — to the kind you wear with that special someone.

   Welcome to Underwear Week, where we’re talking all things underwear,
   from practical — like granny panties or red-carpet-tested invisible
   underwear — to the kind you wear with that special someone.

Women’s underwear

   My mother’s advice about hygiene is simple: Change your underwear every
   day (even on no-shower days), and so far it hasn’t led me astray. But
   for Underwear Week, I put my better judgment aside to call in and test
   Organic Basics’ new silver-coated underwear. Organic Basics claims that
   with silver’s antibacterial (and thus, odor-repelling) qualities, you
   can avoid wasting water and energy simply by wearing their undies more
   than once before washing. I had reservations going in since I’ve tried
   silver-laced pillowcases before and wasn’t impressed, but kept an open
   mind.

   I tested my undies — a hipster style that comes in a two-pack — over
   two days, which happened to be a beneficial time to test odor-repelling
   undies since (full disclosure!) I was also on the tail end of my
   period. While not terribly messy, per se, it is definitely a more
   pungent time than usual. Because an Organic Basics representative told
   me that silver is also heat-regulating, I put them through the wringer
   on my first day by attending a sweaty vinyasa class. I didn’t find them
   to be cooling, really, but at the end of the day, I felt like I smelled
   cleaner than I normally would, given the circumstances. That all
   shifted on my second day when I started noticing a less-than-fresh
   scent while I was out for the night, and while it didn’t reek, I didn’t
   feel comfortable pushing my luck with a third day of testing.

   The crux of the problem with undies that are “antibacterial” is that
   even if they’re reducing odor, they’re not magically self-cleaning, or
   even absorbent in the way Thinx “period-proof” underwear are, so it
   doesn’t change the fact that you’re sitting in two or three days’ worth
   of fabric that’s been brushing up against you — and your sweat and dead
   skin and general funk. And without any testing on the microscopic level
   to determine whether the underpants are actually killing bacteria,
   besides a non-scientific smell test, I think I’d rather toss them in
   the wash than tolerate repeat wears.

   That being said, they are still a good pair of underwear in and of
   themselves, odor-repelling or not. Since they’re made with
   silver-coated polyester thread (which are not supposed to wear out over
   time), the Organic Basics are heftier than the average pair — they look
   like they could take a beating in the washing machine — but still
   comfortable and have stretch to them. They’re nice for lounging, but
   with the thicker edges, I wouldn’t exactly call them VPL-resistant. I
   don’t recommend wearing them if you’re dealing with something like your
   period, but I almost wish these had been around in my college days for
   finals week (when showers were few and far between). I also imagine
   they would be ideal to pack in your bag for a music festival or camping
   trip, when you need all the odor-repelling you can get. — Lori Keong

And as for the men’s underwear

   When Alexis first told me about Danish underwear that stayed clean for
   weeks, I was skeptical. Even with the addition of anti-odor,
   antimicrobial silver fibers, fabric just isn’t meant to be in contact
   with a very intimate part of the body without getting a little … musty,
   no? So when I received my first pair of SilverTech boxer briefs, I
   wanted to dutifully test their stink-fighting abilities. I decided to
   wear them longer than I ordinarily would (Two days? Three? I’d read
   that they could last for weeks and was ready to ride this wave as long
   as I could). I wouldn’t wear them for workouts, which seemed like a
   too-aggressive move for non-exercise underwear. And each morning I’d
   conduct a sniff test to assess just how “good” I was.

   My first impressions of the boxer briefs: The cut isn’t as comfortable
   as my everyday Calvins. The waistband is flimsier and the legs (are
   they called legs on boxer briefs?) are just a bit shorter than I
   prefer. Something about the fabric felt scratchy, too, which I
   confirmed with Organic Basics is something you should expect with
   metal-lined underwear. I do have to say that on the second morning, I
   felt totally confident about wearing them again — they looked and felt
   and smelled like a fresh pair of underwear.

   Morning three is when things got dicey. SilverTech underwear past 48
   hours did not pass my smell test. I reached out to Organic Basics to
   ask what the deal was, and a very nice representative noted that, alas,
   the underwear doesn’t exactly “never” need washing: “It varies from
   person to person — some might feel the need to wash after just one
   wear, and others might want to go longer. To maximize the length of
   time before washing we recommend airing them a little overnight.” In
   fairness, I did not air them overnight, though I can’t imagine anyone
   who doesn’t sleep naked doing that. The verdict is that I could only
   stretch the wears from one day to two between washes, and while that
   doesn’t seem like very much, it does halve the amount of underwear
   you’d have to wash — and the amount you’d need to bring in a carry-on.

Photos: Offices in Silicon Valley That Are Way Better Than Yours

   By Kevin Roose

   09 Nov 2011, San Francisco, California, USA --- Arcade games and a
   foosball table: a common view at social gaming giant Zynga's
   headquarters in San Francisco. Employees are welcome to play, even
   during office hours. --- Image by ? Karsten Lemm/dpa/Corbis
   Photo: Karsten Lemm/dpa/Corbis

   In the tech industry, free snacks and luxury shuttles are no longer
   enough. From putting greens to pod chairs, from Airbnb’s faux-pastoral
   living walls to Zynga’s game room, no expenses are being spared in the
   tech corridor’s arms race for office superiority. Some companies give
   out-of-office perks (Google employees can rent company shuttles at a
   discount for weekend parties), and some make do with catered lunches
   and Friday concerts.

   And why not? Silicon Valley has more money than it knows what to do
   with, and tech contains one of the most competitive labor markets in
   the country. If a hot-shot engineer can be wooed by the promise of a
   roof deck and an espresso bar, these renovations will pay for
   themselves and then some.

   It used to be that tech offices resembled middle-school playplaces —
   all air hockey and Nerf guns. Now the bright colors and ball pits have
   given way to faux-industrial setups and furniture that’s more likely to
   come from a salvage shop than a catalogue, the kind of enhancements
   that convey both riches and artsy sophistication.

   Not every tech company splurges on setting. (Amazon famously uses plain
   wooden doors as desks and cheap chairs for every employee, even CEO
   Jeff Bezos.) But among the big and soon-to-be-big tech companies of the
   Bay Area, there’s no stopping the trend. After all, these companies do
   need productive employees. If your boss can make work feel like a
   playplace, that’s even less of a reason to clock out.

   Juul appears to be in full-blown crisis

   E-cigarette maker Juul is shutting down broadcast, print and digital
   advertising and ending lobbying efforts in Washington as safety
   concerns over vaping intensify.

   The company on Wednesday said its CEO was stepping down and will be
   replaced by a senior executive from Altria, the maker of Marlboro.
   Altria took a 35% stake in Juul in December at a cost of $13 billion.

   Also on Wednesday, one month after announcing that they were in merger
   talks, the tobacco giants Altria and Philip Morris International said
   they were calling off those discussions.

   Juul has long pushed its e-cigarettes as an alternative for adults
   looking to wean themselves off tobacco products. But e-cigarettes have
   become popular among teenagers, and illnesses potentially linked to the
   product are on the rise.

   underwear week Aug. 24, 2018

We Tried the Silver-Infused Underwear That ‘Doesn’t Need Washing for Weeks’

   By Lori Keong and Jason Chen

   Welcome to Underwear Week, where we’re talking all things underwear,
   from practical — like granny panties or red-carpet-tested invisible
   underwear — to the kind you wear with that special someone.
   The Danish brand Organic Basics has a line of silver-infused underwear
   that supposedly fights odor and bacteria. Photo: Courtesy of the
   retailer

Women’s underwear

   My mother’s advice about hygiene is simple: Change your underwear every
   day (even on no-shower days), and so far it hasn’t led me astray. But
   for Underwear Week, I put my better judgment aside to call in and test
   Organic Basics’ new silver-coated underwear. Organic Basics claims that
   with silver’s antibacterial (and thus, odor-repelling) qualities, you
   can avoid wasting water and energy simply by wearing their undies more
   than once before washing. I had reservations going in since I’ve tried
   silver-laced pillowcases before and wasn’t impressed, but kept an open
   mind.

   I tested my undies — a hipster style that comes in a two-pack — over
   two days, which happened to be a beneficial time to test odor-repelling
   undies since (full disclosure!) I was also on the tail end of my
   period. While not terribly messy, per se, it is definitely a more
   pungent time than usual. Because an Organic Basics representative told
   me that silver is also heat-regulating, I put them through the wringer
   on my first day by attending a sweaty vinyasa class. I didn’t find them
   to be cooling, really, but at the end of the day, I felt like I smelled
   cleaner than I normally would, given the circumstances. That all
   shifted on my second day when I started noticing a less-than-fresh
   scent while I was out for the night, and while it didn’t reek, I didn’t
   feel comfortable pushing my luck with a third day of testing.

   The crux of the problem with undies that are “antibacterial” is that
   even if they’re reducing odor, they’re not magically self-cleaning, or
   even absorbent in the way Thinx “period-proof” underwear are, so it
   doesn’t change the fact that you’re sitting in two or three days’ worth
   of fabric that’s been brushing up against you — and your sweat and dead
   skin and general funk. And without any testing on the microscopic level
   to determine whether the underpants are actually killing bacteria,
   besides a non-scientific smell test, I think I’d rather toss them in
   the wash than tolerate repeat wears.

   That being said, they are still a good pair of underwear in and of
   themselves, odor-repelling or not. Since they’re made with
   silver-coated polyester thread (which are not supposed to wear out over
   time), the Organic Basics are heftier than the average pair — they look
   like they could take a beating in the washing machine — but still
   comfortable and have stretch to them. They’re nice for lounging, but
   with the thicker edges, I wouldn’t exactly call them VPL-resistant. I
   don’t recommend wearing them if you’re dealing with something like your
   period, but I almost wish these had been around in my college days for
   finals week (when showers were few and far between). I also imagine
   they would be ideal to pack in your bag for a music festival or camping
   trip, when you need all the odor-repelling you can get. — Lori Keong

And as for the men’s underwear

   When Alexis first told me about Danish underwear that stayed clean for
   weeks, I was skeptical. Even with the addition of anti-odor,
   antimicrobial silver fibers, fabric just isn’t meant to be in contact
   with a very intimate part of the body without getting a little … musty,
   no? So when I received my first pair of SilverTech boxer briefs, I
   wanted to dutifully test their stink-fighting abilities. I decided to
   wear them longer than I ordinarily would (Two days? Three? I’d read
   that they could last for weeks and was ready to ride this wave as long
   as I could). I wouldn’t wear them for workouts, which seemed like a
   too-aggressive move for non-exercise underwear. And each morning I’d
   conduct a sniff test to assess just how “good” I was.

   My first impressions of the boxer briefs: The cut isn’t as comfortable
   as my everyday Calvins. The waistband is flimsier and the legs (are
   they called legs on boxer briefs?) are just a bit shorter than I
   prefer. Something about the fabric felt scratchy, too, which I
   confirmed with Organic Basics is something you should expect with
   metal-lined underwear. I do have to say that on the second morning, I
   felt totally confident about wearing them again — they looked and felt
   and smelled like a fresh pair of underwear.

   Morning three is when things got dicey. SilverTech underwear past 48
   hours did not pass my smell test. I reached out to Organic Basics to
   ask what the deal was, and a very nice representative noted that, alas,
   the underwear doesn’t exactly “never” need washing: “It varies from
   person to person — some might feel the need to wash after just one
   wear, and others might want to go longer. To maximize the length of
   time before washing we recommend airing them a little overnight.” In
   fairness, I did not air them overnight, though I can’t imagine anyone
   who doesn’t sleep naked doing that. The verdict is that I could only
   stretch the wears from one day to two between washes, and while that
   doesn’t seem like very much, it does halve the amount of underwear
   you’d have to wash — and the amount you’d need to bring in a carry-on.
