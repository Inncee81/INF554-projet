   Ending Learning Poverty: A Target to Galvanize Action on Literacy

   A global learning crisis threatens countries’ efforts to build human
   capital and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). A new
   concept—learning poverty—aims to draw attention to this issue, and how
   to defeat it.

   Between 2000 and 2015, the number of people living in extreme poverty
   declined by a total of 802 million in the 15 countries with the highest
   poverty-reduction rates, according to new analysis of World Bank
   poverty data. In each of these countries, an average of at least 1.6%
   of the population moved out of extreme poverty every year. While
   extreme poverty remains endemic in low-income and conflict-affected
   countries, seven of the top 15 countries are in Africa, and two are on
   the World Bank Group’s Harmonized List of Fragile Situations for
   FY19. Read More.

   Some 53% of children in low- and middle-income countries experience
   “learning poverty” – meaning they are unable to read and understand
   simple text by age 10.  To spur progress, the World Bank set a new
   target to cut “learning poverty” in half by 2030. Achieving this goal
   would require a “near tripling” of the current rate of progress and
   would still leave a learning poverty rate of 27%. But under a “business
   as usual scenario,” learning poverty would only fall to 43% by 2030,
   according to a new report, Ending Learning Poverty: What will it take?

   The global forecast for oil production in 2019 has been repeatedly
   revised downward over the last year and a half amid weakening demand
   for oil. Growth in demand  is now around 1%, or 1 million barrels per
   day – the weakest growth rate since 2012, according to the October 2019
   Commodity Markets Outlook. Oil prices are projected to average $60/bbl
   in 2019 and are forecast to weaken to $58/bbl in 2020, $7/bbl lower
   than the previous forecast. The downward revision reflects the weaker
   outlook for global growth and therefore for oil demand. Oil consumption
   growth is expected to increase slightly next year at a level usually
   associated with global downturns. If economic growth deteriorates
   further, oil demand could be substantially weaker, says the report.

   The cost of starting a business in low- and middle-income countries has
   fallen from 141.75% of per capita income in 1990, to 25.25% today,
   according to the World Bank’s Doing Business report, now in its 17^th
   year. Since the report’s inception, 178 economies have implemented 722
   reforms in the area of starting a business, reducing or eliminating
   barriers to entry. Despite such improvements, considerable gaps still
   exist between developed and developing economies on most Doing Business
   indicators. Read more.
