The 7 Core Roles of a 2020 Content Marketing Team

   “What does a content marketing team look like?”

   This is the third most-frequent question from companies after (1) how
   do I measure a content marketing strategy and (2) how do I scale a
   content marketing approach. It should probably be the first.

   You might be a team of one, wearing multiple marketing hats. Or you
   might be a global, siloed, integrated marketing and communications team
   of hundreds. It doesn’t matter. “Content” should absolutely be a
   strategic function in your business. It deserves the same dedication to
   roles and responsibilities that you provide for your accounting, legal,
   sales, and every other strategic activity the business performs.

   There is no possible way to scale, manage, and optimize every channel
   to ensure that the company’s story is being told without a dedicated
   approach to content as a process.

   And, interestingly, the only way to answer the question of how to scale
   the content team is by understanding it as a dedicated function. It’s
   the inherent ingredient in the question of content marketing
   measurement – how a defined team structured around the purpose,
   creation, management, and ultimate flow of content creates value for
   the customers.
   The only way to scale a #content team is to treat it as a dedicated
   function, says @Robert_Rose. Click To Tweet

   My friend and CMI founder Joe Pulizzi wrote a post three years ago that
   defined many of the roles that we still see today. At the time he
   wrote, “While there is no perfect structure for a marketing
   organization, it’s apparent that marketing departments are transforming
   themselves into publishing organizations.”

   Three years later, while much of this has come to pass, we’ve also
   witnessed marked differences. What we’ve seen is a bit messier but
   perhaps a bit more realistic in terms of how businesses approach
   creating a dedicated content marketing team.

   Hybrid teams are emerging where the roles and responsibilities are real
   but shared with more traditional marketing functions. For example, when
   Joe describes the idea of the director of audience, he states it should
   be someone:

     … intimately familiar with the audience members’ characteristics,
     their passion triggers, and what actions you want them to take.

   While our 2020 version of the director of audience development has the
   same responsibilities Joe outlined in 2016, this person is also
   frequently responsible for bridging more internal marketing-related
   relationships in the business. In short, this role makes sure BOTH the
   audience’s needs and the business’ needs are met by the content
   marketing team.

   With that introduction, let’s look at some roles important to the
   function of content marketing in the business.

1. Chief content officer (aka director of content marketing or program
director)

   Most typically the chief content officer is not a C-suite position, but
   leads the content marketing efforts. This is the content ambassador or
   the organization’s chief storyteller. Many times this person fits what
   I call the “arbiter of good.”
   The chief content officer is not a C-suite position but leads the
   #contentmarketing efforts, says @Robert_Rose. Click To Tweet

   This person should be responsible for setting the overall editorial or
   content marketing mission statement and integrating all of your
   content. As every silo (PR, email, social, search, etc.) starts to
   create and curate content, it is the CCO’s responsibility to make sure
   the stories remain consistent and make sense to the audience(s).

   In addition, the CCO must understand how the stories translate into
   results that address the organization’s business issues (e.g., driving
   sales, saving costs, or creating more loyal customers). This role is
   almost always the liaison between the content marketing strategy and
   executive leadership.

2. Content strategy director (aka business, governance, structure director)

   This incredibly important role is one that, given the size or
   complexity of the organization, often sits at equal footing to the
   director of content marketing as a strategic function. Additionally,
   this role (similar to the audience development role) can be split
   against a “front end” and “back end” set of responsibilities.

   On the front end, this director may lead persona development, and/or
   even UI/UX types of customer experiences. The person may assist, (or
   lead) the development of business requirements for content management
   technologies.

   On the back end, this role is responsible for the functional flow of
   content as an asset throughout the business. Content strategists look
   at the structure of content, and thus review taxonomies, and meta data
   strategies. They review governance and workflow approaches to ensure
   that content is flowing smoothly through its management and
   optimization. They may be responsible for content audits, inventories,
   SEO strategy, and ultimately the scalability of these approaches.

3. Content traffic, project, and planning manager (aka managing editor)

   We’ve seen this role emerge as one of the most important. It’s a role
   that exemplifies the balance that content marketing plays against more
   traditional marketing content creation needs. From an owned media
   perspective this role is typically a managing editor – focusing on the
   day-to-day operations of the editorial platform. However, we find that
   the planning manager is often also responsible for developing the
   guidelines and managing the production flow for content from both an
   owned media (proactive editorial creation) and merchandised flow
   (reactive editorial creation). This person is the internal project
   manager who improves content processes, implements solutions to ensure
   that the team is functioning efficiently, and ensures quality and
   compliance with legal, or other regulatory needs.

4. Content production director (aka creative director, format specialist)

   A critical role and one that may be shared among a broader group, the
   production director is responsible for managing how things look. This
   may be the lead creative designer, writer, or perhaps even a format
   specialist leading a cross-functional team of creative specialists
   (e.g., writers, designers, video specialists, photographers). This role
   is ostensibly the creative director for the content team.

5. Audience development manager

   Audience development has come a long way in the last five years. We
   wrote in detail about the audience strategist a few months ago.
   Additionally, we see that, given the increased importance of this role,
   it can be two distinct roles – external or internal communication. As
   Joe wrote, the audience manager “should be responsible for developing
   the subscription assets (direct mail lists, email lists, social media)
   that can grow and be segmented as your content mission matures and
   expands.”

   Additionally, the audience development manager is responsible for the
   paid and earned efforts to engage and draw audiences into both owned
   media and (sometimes) marketing-oriented experiences. This latter
   responsibility is where audience development managers often serve as
   the liaison between content marketing and other initiatives to ensure
   internal activation and participation among the various marketing
   constituencies. In short – the audience development manager often
   serves as the content marketing team’s business development or hype
   person.

6. Influencer wrangler (aka subject matter expert manager, influencer
outreach)

   This is a role that traditionally has sat within corporate
   communications or PR (and still may). But as the creation of content
   from subject matter experts – internal and external – grows as an
   important role in the content strategy, this role is the recruiter,
   wrangler, and manager of these influencers into the content marketing
   process. This person identifies, creates, and maintains the
   relationships with both internal and external influencers who may
   provide content, serve as interviewed guests, or even help to promote
   the content marketing efforts of the business.

7. Technical content manager

   This role understands the technology aspects of content management.
   This person knows the language of content, marketing, and
   communications, and helps the team facilitate their processes with
   technology. This person may manage/operate the content management
   system, the technology behind the editorial calendar, the
   implementation of web analytics, or data-related structures that
   provide management of audiences. This role also may help develop,
   implement, and maintain digital asset management systems. Put simply,
   this is the content team’s technology expert.

Teams have roles too

   Overlaps in responsibilities exist among these roles, and certainly
   most companies will not employ full-time employees to fill each role.
   In many cases, these positions will be assigned as part of other
   aspects of jobs to support the business. In other words, many of these
   roles will be supported by more traditional marketing, technology, or
   even operational professionals. For example, we often see the technical
   content manager role delivered as a shared service within the IT
   department. In another case, the influencer wrangler is a manager
   within the corporate communications team and is a “dotted line” to the
   content team.

   The percentage of time committed to these content marketing roles
   wholly depends on how much content marketing makes up your portfolio of
   integrated marketing and communications. But this is an important
   distinction – it should be dedicated to that function as a team.

   The place where we see most businesses fail with content marketing is
   where these roles are seen as an addition to someone’s regular day job.
   The investment in content marketing becomes a “when you are done
   creating content for sales – you can go to the fitting room and try on
   that managing editor role.”
   #Contentmarketing often fails when content roles are seen as an
   addition to someone's day job, says @Robert_Rose. Click To Tweet

   Creating a team structure is a critically important aspect to making a
   content marketing approach work. A common structure looks a bit like
   this:

   The roles are segmented by each group’s roles:
     * The editorial board is a team led and facilitated by the content
       marketing program manager. This cross-functional group informs and
       is informed by the editorial strategy and calendar created by the
       content team. This board helps set thematic priorities, directs and
       coordinates content across audiences and channels, and generally
       acts as the voice of the business. The audience development manager
       is a frequent liaison between the editorial board and the other
       content teams.
     * The content execution team may be separate or split among the
       broader marketing communications organization and the dedicated
       content team itself. The content team may have responsibility for
       the management of content-oriented projects and platforms, but the
       content may be actually created by others in the business.
     * The executive leadership team recognizes and empowers the
       processes, guidelines, and standard playbooks, as well as setting
       the budget and business priorities of content and content
       marketing. Typically, the content program manager is the liaison
       between the content marketing strategy and the leadership team.

Adjust accordingly

   We should note that this list isn’t all-inclusive. Many specialists can
   play an important part of an overall content marketing strategy. Roles
   such as channel experts (social media, email, print, video, etc.),
   librarians, translation and localization experts, dedicated editors,
   SEO experts, and others are all seen within the broader context of
   content and marketing strategy.

   Overall, however, focusing on building a functional strategy – and
   applying the most important roles to your business – is what counts the
   most. Laura Hamlyn, global content director for Red Hat, now has 45
   team members for the brand’s strategic content approach. As she said,
   “We’ve been given a lot of responsibility at Red Hat. Brands have to
   deliver consistent value in a consistent voice. The way we do that is
   with a consistent team.”

   These roles can help you begin to assemble the right and consistent
   team for your content marketing program’s growth and success.

The History of Content Marketing [Updated Infographic]

   history-content-marketing If you want some insights into where the
   content marketing industry may be headed, it might just help to take a
   look at where it’s been.

   As we pointed out when CMI shared its History of Content Marketing
   infographic in 2012, brands have been telling their stories to
   audiences for hundreds of years. Not to mention that storytelling
   itself is one of the oldest forms of communication.

   While we used to consider John Deere’s The Furrow to be the oldest
   example of content marketing, Robert Rose and I have unearthed several
   more examples on our weekly This Old Marketing podcast:

   1732 – Benjamin Franklin first publishes the yearly Poor Richard’s
   Almanack. The goal is to promote his printing business.

   1801 – Bookstore Librairie Galignani employs creative content
   strategies to grow its business, including opening a reading room and
   printing a newspaper that featured articles from influential authors
   and books.

   1861 – Samuel Wagner launches American Bee Journal, a magazine that is
   still being published.

   1867 – Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Company debuts
   The Locomotive, which is now said to be the oldest company magazine
   continuously published under the same name in the United States.

   1882 – The Edison Electric Lighting Company Bulletin spreads the word
   about the benefits of electric lighting.

   1887 – Charles Scribner’s Sons publishes Scribner’s Magazine, which
   provides a look inside the lives of its most famous authors. It
   competes with Harper’s Monthly and Atlantic Monthly, but its goal was
   to generate sales of Scribner’s books.

   1888 – Johnson & Johnson launches a publication called Modern Methods
   of Antiseptic Wound Treatment that is aimed at the needs of doctors to
   whom the company sold bandages. The company also launches two
   publications to share helpful articles with the medical community.

   But despite the age of the technique, the power it wields hasn’t
   diminished at all. In fact, examples of brands using content marketing
   – and the impact of those efforts – have increased exponentially over
   the years. That’s why we thought it would be a good time to update our
   infographic to include some of the most significant achievements that
   have happened over the past few years.

The Future Is Now: 4 Rules for the Post-Advertising Age

   crystal ball with eye-illustration With abject apologies to the young
   Bob Dylan, nobody in adland needs a weatherman to know which way the
   wind blows these days. It blows toward great content.

   Seriously? We’re gonna have another debate about the future of
   advertising? It’s a little late for that. But there’s still time, I
   think, for a heart-to-heart about how, and how quickly, we get there.

   Adland’s confusion about advertising’s future reminds me of America’s
   more consequential relationship to climate change: There’s general
   agreement about many of the facts (CO[2] levels are rising), little
   understanding of the causes (It can’t be people. Could it be cow
   farts?), and zero ability to accept the logical consequences (Yes, sea
   levels are rising, so Miami will be underwater). The result: paralysis
   and ineffectiveness.

   The ad biz version: We see the facts. (TV’s share of total
   media-watching time, for example, has contracted by 10.75 percent over
   the last five years, according to eMarketer). We even understand the
   causes. (More people are watching streaming TV without ads, and 47
   percent of all media time is now spent on digital devices). But there’s
   precious little discussion in our business about the “whys” behind this
   mass behavior change, and there’s outright denial of the logical
   consequences.

   Despite everything we know, the entire media industry keeps talking
   about “the future of advertising” as if it was, well… way off in the
   future, like a remote land we might visit one day. Our audiences — the
   folks we keep trying to reach (formerly known as consumers) — woke up
   in the “future” roughly eight years ago, when digital became social and
   changed media forever. Now audiences seamlessly consume (and create)
   media — TV, movies, music, books, news — across all kinds of devices.
   (Another fact: The New York Times says NBC just paid an eye-popping
   $7.5 billion to extend its rights to the Olympics because “more viewers
   consume media on their own schedules, often without commercials.” This
   puts the Olympics among a dwindling number of spectacles that keep
   audiences watching, and advertisers paying, in real time.)

Rules to follow

   For brands and agencies, it’s past time to face the consequences of
   what’s happening. Here are four rules for successful advertising now:
    1. Ads can’t interrupt anymore because people have too many choices
       and too much control over the media they consume. Consequently, ads
       have to change into content that actually deserves an audience —
       compelling, authentic stories that create real meaning and provide
       real value to a brand’s audiences.
    2. Brand stories have to be told on the audience’s schedule — 24/7,
       across all media, mostly on social channels or digital platforms
       owned by the brand.
    3. Brand stories have to be so good, so true, and so contagious that
       they compel audiences to share them.
    4. Brand stories have to unmistakably embody the brand and its unique
       core narrative, differentiating it from all others.

   All sorts of agencies with all sorts of models are flooding into the
   newly created “content” and “storytelling” space. But precious few are
   displaying the vision or breadth of skills needed to take charge of
   advertising and keep it working for clients. Content marketing and
   editorial agencies lack brand knowledge. Traditional agencies lack both
   storytelling and digital knowledge. Digital agencies lack strategic
   knowledge and don’t understand content at all. What’s demanded is a
   hybrid that’s very tough to create: a completely integrated shop that
   understands editorial thinking and brand management so intrinsically
   that it can create strategically effective, branded narrative
   executions for TV, web, print, live events, Twitter — for any delivery
   format now known or ever to be invented.

   For me (and for my agency, Story), the future clearly belongs to anyone
   who can put brilliant brand management, strategy, media planning, and
   storytelling into a single, integrated shop.

   This will involve more than just a shift in approach, however. It will
   require a serious reorganization of how agencies and brand marketers
   operate. The starting point is banishing silos and killing the idea
   that channel specialists are useful. (No more “digital units” or “TV
   teams,” please.) The end game is integrating all disciplines —
   creative, planning, technology, production, accounts, and media
   planning and buying — into a single multidisciplinary, multichannel
   team. That’s the hardest part. But everyone knows it has to happen.

   From there, the newly organized agency will have to dedicate its
   integrated organization to upholding the first commandment of future
   advertising (which has always been the first commandment of
   storytellers — the folks who create successful movies, books, photos,
   poems, and TV series):

You shall put the audience first!

   Your brand and how it’s managed are critical; but your audience’s needs
   and desires need to be seen as even more critical, if you actually want
   that brand to connect with people. You’ve got to respect the audience.
   You’ve got to earn people’s attention. You can’t force anyone to listen
   to you anymore, so you’ve got to make media they actually want to see;
   media so good they want to share it with their friends, too. That’s the
   present and future of advertising.

   There are a lot more demands, of course. Advertising in the future will
   be complicated because it not only has to have a great story to tell,
   it also has to be data-driven, technologically enabled, automatically
   distributed, targeted with pinpoint accuracy, constantly measured and
   optimized, and so on.

   But without a great, unique, and authentic brand story to tell, none of
   that will get you far. That means we have to matter to the audience or
   we’ve lost before we’ve begun.

   As I so often say, welcome to the post-advertising age.
