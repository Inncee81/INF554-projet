Martinelli 9/10, Tierney 7/10 as newcomers shine for Arsenal in Europe

   [share-icon-fb.png] [share-icon-tw.png] [wapp.png]

   Arsenal romped to their second win of the Europa League group stage
   with a comfortable 4-0 victory over Standard Liege at the Emirates.
   Gabriel Martinelli scored twice inside 20 minutes, followed by goals by
   Joe Willock (22nd minuted) and Dani Ceballos (57th minute).

Positives

   There were first European starts of the season for Kieran Tierney and
   Hector Bellerin, with both putting in good showings, while young
   Martinelli looks a real find. The Brazilian was clinical in front of
   goal, and will be knocking on Unai Emery's door for some Premier League
   game time sooner rather than later.

Negatives

   There will be tougher tests to come for this Arsenal side on their
   quest for European glory, and the feeble threat offered by the Belgians
   meant some of the Gunners didn't even need to break sweat, which
   perhaps isn't ideal when it comes to gaining genuine match sharpness.

Manager rating out of 10

   7 -- Emery chose the right time to introduce Tierney and Bellerin, and
   his selection of a hungry front three paid dividends with a blistering
   attacking display, particularly in the first half.

Player ratings (1-10; 10 = best, players introduced after 70 minutes get no
rating)

   GK Emiliano Martinez, 6 -- Got away with some poor decision-making in
   the first half when engaging with some awkward crosses, but was never
   forced to make any testing saves against a blunt Liege attack.

   DF Hector Bellerin, 7 -- The Spaniard made his first start following a
   lengthy injury layoff, and was keen to get involved with his side's
   attacking play, while being completely untested in his own defensive
   third.

   DF Shkodran Mustafi, 6 -- One loose pass in the first half went
   unpunished in what was the only blemish on a comfortable evening. Three
   clean sheets in three appearances this season for the German.

   DF Rob Holding, 6 -- The centre-back was a virtual bystander for the
   duration as Liege offered close to no attacking threat.

   DF Kieran Tierney, 7 -- Brilliant work down the left and a great cross
   provided Martinelli with the ammunition to head home the Arsenal
   opener, in what was an impressive European bow for his new employers.

   MF Dani Ceballos, 7 -- The Real Madrid loanee knitted play together
   nicely in the final third and occasionally dropped deep to pick up the
   ball from the back four. Finally, capped off a good display with an
   easy tap-in to put his side four up.

   MF Lucas Torreira, 6 -- The Uruguayan returned to his preferred central
   role in the Arsenal midfield but was guilty of one or two sloppy
   moments in possession. Failed to make the Liege goalkeeper work with a
   free kick on the edge of the box.

   MF Joe Willock, 7 -- The academy graduate reacted quickly to set
   himself and glide the ball home to put the game to bed midway through
   the first half. Brought off for Matteo Guendouzi for the final 16
   minutes.

   MF Ainsley Maitland-Niles, 6 -- The 22-year-old was given a chance in
   his favoured right-wing role, but will be disappointed he couldn't have
   the same impact as the rest of his attacking colleagues. Released
   Martinelli in the penalty area on the way to Arsenal's fourth and was
   replaced by Nicolas Pepe in the 66th minute.

   MF Reiss Nelson, 7 -- Did well to work space out wide to supply the
   pass to Martinelli for Arsenal's second, and played his part in the
   third as his blocked shot fell to the feet of goalscorer Willock.
   Replaced in the 79th minute by Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.

   FW Gabriel Martinelli, 9 -- The 18-year-old got off the mark with an
   instinctive glancing header after 13 minutes, and followed it up with a
   superbly arrowed strike through a crowd of Liege bodies in the penalty
   area just minutes later. The Brazilian wasn't done there, providing a
   lovely dinked cross for Ceballos to poke home Arsenal's fourth.

Substitutes

   Nicolas Pepe, 6 -- Got himself involved with Arsenal's attacking play
   but was unable to add to the scoring.

   Matteo Guendouzi, N/R -- Slotted into the Arsenal midfield to keep play
   ticking over.

   Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, N/R -- The Gunners' supreme marksman didn't
   have quite enough time to get himself on the scoresheet in his brief
   cameo, but came close with a half-volley in the box in the closing
   stages.

RB Gordon could soon end holdout, sources say

   ESPNSep 25, 20192 Minute Read

Schefter: Gordon is close to ending holdout

   Adam Schefter discusses the timeline of when Melvin Gordon might end
   his holdout and return to the Chargers.

   Los Angeles Chargers running back Melvin Gordon could soon be moving up
   his reporting date, though no final decisions have been made, league
   sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter.

   He must report no later than Nov. 29 to play in 2019 and accrue credit
   for this season toward becoming a free agent in the offseason.

   Without Gordon, the Chargers (1-2) rank 13th in the NFL with 111.7
   rushing yards per game. Austin Ekeler (160 yards this season) and
   Justin Jackson (142) have combined to fill the void.

   Gordon, 26, continues to hold out because of a contract impasse with
   the Chargers. Gordon's representation was granted permission by the
   Chargers to pursue a trade, but so far no deal has materialized.

   Gordon is scheduled to make $5.605 million in the final season of his
   rookie deal. Just before the season, Chargers general manager Tom
   Telesco announced that the team had postponed negotiations with Gordon
   until after the season. If Gordon chooses to report, he will play under
   his current contract.

   Gordon wants a contract extension that will compensate him similarly to
   top backs Todd Gurley, David Johnson and Le'Veon Bell, who earn an
   average of $13 million to $14 million annually. During training camp,
   the Chargers offered Gordon a new contract that would double his salary
   at roughly $10 million annually.

   ESPN's Eric D. Williams contributed to this report.

   Los Angeles Chargers running back Melvin Gordon could soon be moving up
   his reporting date, though no final decisions have been made, league
   sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter.

   Gordon had previously planned to return at some point in October, but

   He must report no later than Nov. 29 to play in 2019 and accrue credit

   The former first-round draft pick has rushed for 3,628 yards and has
   1,577 receiving yards with 38 total touchdowns in his first four
   seasons.

Braves critical of Ronald Acuna Jr. for not running out hit in loss

   [ ]


   Jesse RogersESPN Staff WriterOct 3, 20193 Minute Read

Acuna responds to lack of hustle criticism

   Ronald Acuna Jr. addresses the concern around his lack of hustle, and
   Freddie Freeman admits Acuna not running out of the box in the seventh
   was frustrating.

   ATLANTA -- It happened again. And this time it was in a postseason
   game.

   "Yeah, it's frustrating," Braves star first baseman Freddie Freeman
   said. "But I think you have that conversation once. It's kind of
   beating a dead horse after that if you keep having the same
   conversation over and over again. You have to know that was a mistake."

   Acuna connected off Cardinals reliever John Brebbia in the seventh, and
   right-fielder Dexter Fowler played it off the wall. By the time he
   turned to throw the ball back in, Acuna was just getting to first base.
   He didn't have much of an explanation for not running.

   "Things happen. Stuff like this doesn't happen to the one who is
   sitting on the bench," Acuna told ESPN's Enrique Rojas. "It could have
   been a double, but things happen. I didn't speak with the manager about
   it. I just went out to enjoy the game. I always try to give my best,
   but these are things that sometimes get away from me. They are not
   things I want to do. As players, we always try to give our best effort,
   but we make mistakes, we are human."

   The inning could have turned out differently if Acuna was at second
   base. An Ozzie Albies groundout would have gotten him to third instead
   of second. He was eventually doubled off the bag when Josh Donaldson
   lined out to shortstop. In a one-run loss, the mistake loomed large.

   "He probably scores in that inning if he's on second base," Albies
   said. "It's a big deal. He knows he needs to do better there."

   "I simply want him to respect the game and respect me as a veteran
   player," Martinez told reporters. "That's it. Just play the game."

   But in the Braves clubhouse, the focus was on the seventh-inning play.

   "He should have been on second," manager Brian Snitker said. "And we're
   kind of shorthanded to do anything about it right there. You hate to
   see that happen."

   Snitker pulled Acuna from a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers on
   Aug. 18, trying to make the point to the young star that running out
   every ball is important, even more so in October.

   "That can't happen in the playoffs," Freeman said. "Can't happen in the
   regular season. Unfortunately that happened tonight."

   Teammates didn't say anything publicly that they didn't say to Acuna
   first.

   "A couple guys told him, 'Yeah, just run out of the box,'" Albies
   relayed. "It's something you should do."

   Acuna was asked if he had another chance, would he do things
   differently.

   "Absolutely," he said. "I mean, I was trying to give my best effort and
   those are those things that just kind of get away from you. So,
   obviously, I would've loved to have a double, if I could take it back."

   ATLANTA -- It happened again. And this time it was in a postseason
   game.

   Atlanta Braves center fielder Ronald Acuna Jr. failed to run out a ball
   he hit off the wall in right field, settling for just a single. The
   last time it happened, in August, he was benched. This time, he was
   called out by his teammates after the Braves lost 7-6 to the St. Louis
   Cardinals in Game 1 of their best-of-five National League Division
   Series on Thursday.

   "Yeah, it's frustrating," Braves star first baseman Freddie Freeman
   said. "But I think you have that conversation once. It's kind of
   beating a dead horse after that if you keep having the same
   conversation over and over again. You have to know that was a mistake."

   Acuna connected off Cardinals reliever John Brebbia in the seventh, and
   right-fielder Dexter Fowler played it off the wall. By the time he
   turned to throw the ball back in, Acuna was just getting to first base.
   He didn't have much of an explanation for not running.

   "Things happen. Stuff like this doesn't happen to the one who is
   sitting on the bench," Acuna told ESPN's Enrique Rojas. "It could have
   been a double, but things happen. I didn't speak with the manager about
   it. I just went out to enjoy the game. I always try to give my best,
   but these are things that sometimes get away from me. They are not
   things I want to do. As players, we always try to give our best effort,
   but we make mistakes, we are human."

   The inning could have turned out differently if Acuna was at second
   base. An Ozzie Albies groundout would have gotten him to third instead
   of second. He was eventually doubled off the bag when Josh Donaldson
   lined out to shortstop. In a one-run loss, the mistake loomed large.

   "He probably scores in that inning if he's on second base," Albies
   said. "It's a big deal. He knows he needs to do better there."

   The lack of hustle overshadowed Acuna's fantastic night at the plate,
   which included a walk and three hits, including a ninth-inning home
   run. But even the home run irked some; Cardinals reliever Carlos
   Martinez, who surrendered it, was upset at Acuna's home run trot.

   "I simply want him to respect the game and respect me as a veteran
   player," Martinez told reporters. "That's it. Just play the game."

   But in the Braves clubhouse, the focus was on the seventh-inning play.

   "He should have been on second," manager Brian Snitker said. "And we're
   kind of shorthanded to do anything about it right there. You hate to
   see that happen."

   Snitker pulled Acuna from a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers on
   Aug. 18, trying to make the point to the young star that running out
   every ball is important, even more so in October.

   "That can't happen in the playoffs," Freeman said. "Can't happen in the
   regular season. Unfortunately that happened tonight."

   Teammates didn't say anything publicly that they didn't say to Acuna
   first.

   "A couple guys told him, 'Yeah, just run out of the box,'" Albies
   relayed. "It's something you should do."

   Acuna was asked if he had another chance, would he do things
   differently.

   "Absolutely," he said. "I mean, I was trying to give my best effort and
   those are those things that just kind of get away from you. So,
   obviously, I would've loved to have a double, if I could take it back."
