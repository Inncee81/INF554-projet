Ireland - Day 6

   Welcome to Thinking Out Loud Thursday!  Today I'm thinking about the
   last full day of our vacation in Ireland.  If you need to catch up, you
   can read my previous posts here ~
                    Day 1  &  2     |     Day 3     |     Day 4     |
   Day 5
   The agenda for Day 6 of our Ireland trip was one I had been looking
   forward to since way before we left home.  We would be having high tea
   at the Westbury!  But before tea time, we visited the famous Book of
   Kells.  Throughout the week, when we had mentioned that going to see
   the Book of Kells was on our itinerary, it was met with mixed reviews.
   Some people told us not to waste our time, while others said it was a
   must do.  The Book of Kells is one of Ireland's most prized possessions
   and is tucked away in the Old Library at Trinity College.  We purchased
   tickets ahead of time online and had chose to go when the library first
   opened in the morning.  This proved to be a great decision because we
   didn't have to wait in line to get in or to get an up close and
   personal look at the book itself.  No pictures are allows of the book,
   but you can snap away at the large displays leading up to the calfskin
   vellum creation.
   After seeing the actual Book of Kells, you can then wander into the
   Long Room library.  We found this long hall of books to be most
   fascinating!
   [close%2Bup%2Bof%2Bbook%2Bshelf.jpg]
   [book%2Bof%2Bkells%2Blong%2Broom.jpg]
   [long%2Broom.jpg]
   [us%2Bat%2Bbook%2Bof%2Bkells.jpg]
   The Long Room has the reputation of being one of the world's most
   beautiful libraries and I would definitely have to agree.  And yes, the
   books get dusted daily!  (Not a job I would be very good at!)
   [duster%2Bin%2Bbook%2Bof%2Bkells.jpg]
   After soaking up all the things about The Book of Kells and the Long
   Room we had just enough time to wonder around Dublin soaking up as much
   of the atmosphere as we could before going to the Westbury for high
   tea.  We had the most perfect spot right by the window overlooking
   Grafton Street.  We sat in our luxurious chairs enjoying the sun that
   was streaming in the windows.  Ahhh, it makes me smile just remembering
   how wonderful it was!
   High Tea
   Tea was delivered in the most divine silver pots.  They had over 30
   different teas to choose from and you could try as many as you liked.
   [teapot%2Bat%2Bwestbury.jpg]
   We sampled the selection of sandwiches, scones and pastries all while
   enjoying the beautiful music being played on the grand piano.  Truly a
   magical experience!
   [tower%2Bat%2Bthe%2Bwestbury.jpg]
   [westbury%2Bdesserts.jpg]
   I could have sat there all day - and someday when I go back I will -
   but we needed to move on to our next activity.  We were taking the
   train to Malahide to visit the Malahide Castle.
   [door%2Bof%2Bmalahide%2Bcastle.jpg]
   This location was high on my list of things to see because for
   generations it was occupied by the Talbot family.  My maiden name is
   Talbot and I just know that one of those Talbots that lived there must
   be related to me!  Can you see the resemblance??
   [talbots%2Bat%2Bmalahide.jpg]
   On the tour, we heard the Talbot story while exploring the private
   rooms and collections.  After touring the castle, we visited the
   gardens and butterfly house located on the property.
   [malahide%2Bgarden.jpg]
   [IMG_9444.JPG]
   [IMG_9446.JPG]
   It was getting close to dinner time and our goal was to get to the
   village of Howth for our last supper in Ireland.  It was a short train
   ride away and so worth it!
   [buildings%2Bof%2Bhowth.jpg]
   The quaint little village sits right on the northern boundary of Dublin
   Bay and couldn't be more adorable.  We had heard you can often see
   seals playing on the shores, but unfortunately we didn't spot any while
   we were there.  Just another reason we need to return!
   [boats%2Bat%2Bhowth.jpg]
   We found a pub to sit down and enjoy our last seafood chowder and fish
   'n chips.  I'll be honest, we picked the pub just because we liked the
   name - The Brass Monkey.  Luckily for us, it was a great choice and the
   food was wonderful.
   Not wanting our time in Ireland to come to an end, we had a seat by the
   shore and soaked up all we could before catching the last train back to
   Dublin.
   And that my friends is a recap of our last full day in Ireland.  Would
   I go back?  YES.  Did we enjoy this trip immensely?  Absolutely!!
   Now it's your turn.  What are you thinking out loud about today?  Link
   up and share!

       That library looks fantastic! I loved touring the old castles in
       France; there is something about those old castles that I just find
       fascinating.

       Oh, that library!! Warms this librarian's heart. Would love to
       spend a few hours there. And then enjoy tea and all the decorum
       that accompanies it. Ireland has moved to the top of my travel
       bucket list. And seeing your pics and reading that you absolutely
       enjoyed your trip and would go back again, just confirms it.

       Golly, that was a trip of a lifetime...I'm so happy you enjoyed it!
       The library was fantastic, all that history, and who wouldn't want
       to delve into those gorgeous tea goodies...sigh. There is something
       to be said for Old World everything!

Wonderful Wednesday Blog Hop - September 25, 2019

Welcome!

   Welcome to the Wonderful Wednesday Blog Hop where we enjoy linking up
   posts about recipes, crafts, DIY, everyday life & more every Tue at
   7:00 pm EST #wwbloghop
   Did anyone see the Harvest Moon on the 13th? It was spectacular! It was
   a bit spooky but beautiful, all at the same time.
   This week seemed to have turned the corner and, even though the
   temperatures are still a bit high in my area, it's starting to feel
   like fall.  I love seeing all the links about fall things and I'm sure
   this week will bring on even more!
   Let's get busy with this party, but first some posts from last week.
