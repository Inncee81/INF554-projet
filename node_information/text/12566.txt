   Oral contraceptives for family planning worldwide have revolutionized
   the reproductive lives of millions of women since their introduction in
   the 1960s. Later on, a variety of side-effects including cardiovascular
   diseases was recognized. In response to these concerns, new generations
   of combined oral contraceptives were developed that featured lower dose
   of estrogen and newer, more potent progestogens. The effectiveness and
   ease of use of combined hormonal contraceptives suggest that they will
   continue to be used to a significant extent in the future. This
   ninety-first volume of IARC Monographs contains evaluations of the
   carcinogenic hazard to humans of combined estrogen-progestogen
   contraceptives and combined estrogen-protestogen menopausal therapy.
   The hormonal drugs reviewed in this volume involve co-administration of
   an estrogen and a progestogen. Studies that did not provide information
   on the use of combined estrogen-progestogen agents are not reviewed. It
   should also be noted that this volume reviews only studies that are
   publicly available and therefore does not include pharmaceutical test
   results that are not in the public domain. The evaluations developed in
   this volume identify specific forms of cancer for which the risk is
   increased or decreased by combined estrogen-progestogen contraceptives
   and provide information that will help address the health concerns and
   well-being of hundred of millions of women worldwide.

   ***This book was highly commended in the Public Health category of the
   British Medical Association's 2013 annual Medical Book Competition.***

   Volume 100 of the IARC Monographs, A Review of Human Carcinogens,
   covers all agents previously classified by IARC as "carcinogenic to
   humans (Group 1)" and was developed by six separate Working Groups:
   Pharmaceuticals; Biological agents; Arsenic, Metals, Fibres, and Dusts;
   Radiation; Personal Habits and Indoor Combustions; Chemical Agents and
   Related Occupations. This Volume 100B covers Biological Agents,
   specifically Epstein-Barr Virus, Hepatitis B Virus, Hepatitis C Virus,
   Kaposi Sarcoma Herpesvirus, Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1, Human
   Papillomaviruses, Human T-cell Lymphotropic Virus Type 1, Opisthorchis
   Viverrini and Clonorchis Sinensis, Schistosoma Haematobium, and
   Helicobacter Pylori.

   Because the scope of Volume 100 is so broad, its Monographs are focused
   on key information. Each Monograph presents a description of a
   carcinogenic agent and how people are exposed, critical overviews of
   the epidemiological studies and animal cancer bioassays, and a concise
   review of the agent's toxicokinetics, plausible mechanisms of
   carcinogenesis, and potentially susceptible populations, and
   life-stages. Details of the design and results of individual
   epidemiological studies and animal cancer bioassays are summarized in
   tables. Short tables that highlight key results are printed in Volume
   100, and more extensive tables that include all studies appear on the
   Monographs programme website (http://monographs.iarc.fr).

   It is hoped that this volume, by compiling the knowledge accumulated
   through several decades of cancer research, will stimulate cancer
   prevention activities worldwide, and will be a valued resource for
   future research to identify other agents suspected of causing cancer in
   humans.

   Presents the results of an expert evaluation of the carcinogenic risk
   to humans posed by infection with two lymphotropic herpesviruses:
   Epstein-Barr virus and Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus/human herpesvirus
   8, a new human herpesvirus detected in 1994 in Kaposi's sarcoma
   associated with AIDS. The viruses are evaluated in separate monographs,
   which consider the biology of the virus, the epidemiology of
   infections, related animal viruses, and mechanistic studies, in
   addition to abundant studies of cancer in humans.

   Oral contraceptives for family planning worldwide have revolutionized
   the reproductive lives of millions of women since their introduction in
   the 1960s. Later on, a variety of side-effects including cardiovascular
   diseases was recognized. In response to these concerns, new generations
   of combined oral contraceptives were developed that featured lower dose
   of estrogen and newer, more potent progestogens. The effectiveness and
   ease of use of combined hormonal contraceptives suggest that they will
   continue to be used to a significant extent in the future. This
   ninety-first volume of IARC Monographs contains evaluations of the
   carcinogenic hazard to humans of combined estrogen-progestogen
   contraceptives and combined estrogen-protestogen menopausal therapy.
   The hormonal drugs reviewed in this volume involve co-administration of
   an estrogen and a progestogen. Studies that did not provide information
   on the use of combined estrogen-progestogen agents are not reviewed. It
   should also be noted that this volume reviews only studies that are
   publicly available and therefore does not include pharmaceutical test
   results that are not in the public domain. The evaluations developed in
   this volume identify specific forms of cancer for which the risk is
   increased or decreased by combined estrogen-progestogen contraceptives
   and provide information that will help address the health concerns and
   well-being of hundred of millions of women worldwide.

   ***This book was highly commended in the Public Health category of the
   British Medical Association's 2013 annual Medical Book Competition.***

   Volume 100 of the IARC Monographs, A Review of Human Carcinogens,
   covers all agents previously classified by IARC as "carcinogenic to
   humans (Group 1)" and was developed by six separate Working Groups:
   Pharmaceuticals; Biological agents; Arsenic, Metals, Fibres, and Dusts;
   Radiation; Personal Habits and Indoor Combustions; Chemical Agents and
   Related Occupations. This Volume 100B covers Biological Agents,
   specifically Epstein-Barr Virus, Hepatitis B Virus, Hepatitis C Virus,
   Kaposi Sarcoma Herpesvirus, Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1, Human
   Papillomaviruses, Human T-cell Lymphotropic Virus Type 1, Opisthorchis
   Viverrini and Clonorchis Sinensis, Schistosoma Haematobium, and
   Helicobacter Pylori.

   Because the scope of Volume 100 is so broad, its Monographs are focused
   on key information. Each Monograph presents a description of a
   carcinogenic agent and how people are exposed, critical overviews of
   the epidemiological studies and animal cancer bioassays, and a concise
   review of the agent's toxicokinetics, plausible mechanisms of
   carcinogenesis, and potentially susceptible populations, and
   life-stages. Details of the design and results of individual
   epidemiological studies and animal cancer bioassays are summarized in
   tables. Short tables that highlight key results are printed in Volume
   100, and more extensive tables that include all studies appear on the
   Monographs programme website (http://monographs.iarc.fr).

   It is hoped that this volume, by compiling the knowledge accumulated
   through several decades of cancer research, will stimulate cancer
   prevention activities worldwide, and will be a valued resource for
   future research to identify other agents suspected of causing cancer in
   humans.

   Presents the results of an expert evaluation of the carcinogenic risk
   to humans posed by infection with two lymphotropic herpesviruses:
   Epstein-Barr virus and Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus/human herpesvirus
   8, a new human herpesvirus detected in 1994 in Kaposi's sarcoma
   associated with AIDS. The viruses are evaluated in separate monographs,
   which consider the biology of the virus, the epidemiology of
   infections, related animal viruses, and mechanistic studies, in
   addition to abundant studies of cancer in humans.
