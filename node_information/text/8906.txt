Humans Can Improve Technology without Really Understanding It

   Small tweaks, not deep physical insight, can lead to a better mousetrap

   Humans Can Improve Technology without Really Understanding It

   Did early human inventions—bows and arrows, houses, kayaks—result from
   innate smarts that bested the intelligence of chimps, lions and other
   species? Or did these artifacts arise from a gradual accretion of
   knowledge—tiny modifications over innumerable generations that
   constitute the passing along of collective cultural wisdom? Such shared
   information would not necessarily require individuals to gain a basic
   understanding of the physical workings of the slowly evolving
   technologies.

   In academia, these contrasting accounts proceed along two tracks.
   Proponents of a “cognitive niche” hypothesis argue that humans’
   singular planning abilities and understanding of cause-and-effect
   relationships enabled them to create technologies to readily adapt to a
   broad array of environments—ecological niches—that span the planet. On
   the opposing side, the “cultural niche” camp contends that even early
   technologies such as the bow and arrow were highly intricate
   inventions, the designs of which transcended the ingenuity of any
   single individual—even a Bronze Age Einstein.

   How does such a dispute get resolved? One solution is to run an
   experiment that simulates technological development across multiple
   generations. A young French scientist, Maxime Derex, set about doing
   just that, making a strong case for culture as the driving force for
   this process.

   In the study, Derex and his colleagues recruited multiple
   “generations”—each represented by one French university student. Each
   student was given five attempts to make a wheel roll faster down a
   meter-long track by adjusting the positions of weights along the length
   of the wheel’s four spokes. The arrangement of the weights during the
   last two tries was recorded in a video and shown to the next generation
   in a chain of five students. Fourteen such chains took part in the
   first stage of the experiment.

   Adjusting the weights allowed the students to control both the wheel’s
   inertia and center of mass. It was not as easy as it might seem. “If
   you think that you’d have no problem with this task, think again, as
   even students of physics or engineering did not find it intuitive,”
   noted Rachel L. Kendal of Durham University in England in a commentary
   published along with the study in the May issue of Nature Human
   Behaviour.

   The results showed that wheel speed increased as each chain of students
   progressed through its five generations. The average rose from 123.6
   meters per hour on average in the first generation to 145.7 meters per
   hour in the fifth. (The maximum possible speed was 154 meters per
   hour.)

   The researchers also measured the subjects’ understanding of which
   weight configuration worked best. At the end of a turn, a student from
   each chain was presented with pairs of wheels with different weight
   alignments—and was asked to predict which would cover the distance
   fastest. Despite all their fiddling during each turn, the students
   demonstrated no increased insight into the reasons a particular
   adjustment speeded things up. “They had no clue about why it works,”
   says Derex, now a researcher in cultural evolution at the Institute for
   Advanced Study in Toulouse, France, who is also affiliated with the
   French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS). Even when the
   experiments were repeated with another 14 chains—in which, this time,
   the first four students were asked to write down a theory about which
   configuration worked best before passing it to the next generation—the
   recipients of these missives were unable to use the information
   to improve their understanding of the wheel.

   The study was generally well received. Kevin N. Laland, a professor of
   behavioral and evolutionary biology at the University of St. Andrews in
   Scotland, who was not involved with the research, praised Derex and his
   colleagues as a “strong team of scientists, all of whom consistently
   churn out excellent work.” Laland, who has previously co-authored
   papers with the new study’s senior author, Alex Mesoudi of the
   University of Exeter in England, concurs with its findings. “People
   regularly take up casually opaque behavior, rarely understand why the
   cultural beliefs and practices they adopt are effective, and often
   devise spurious and scientifically unfounded explanations for their
   behavior,” he says.

   Olivier Morin, a group leader at the Max Planck Institute for the
   Science of Human History in Jena, Germany, who was not involved with
   the study, called it “very clever and flawlessly executed.” But he
   added that the findings do not necessarily contradict the cognitive
   niche hypothesis—which, in his view, is not incompatible with arguments
   favoring a cultural niche. “Just because our causal understanding of
   technology is imperfect does not mean it is nonexistent,” he says.
   “Learners do not tinker at random to produce pointless techniques.” As
   an example, Morin points to students in the wheel study having avoided
   adjusting the weights in ways that decreased both acceleration and
   speed.

   Derex and his colleagues do not deny that human smarts play some
   role—and that cognitive and cultural explanations probably exist on a
   continuum. But Robert Boyd, a co-author of the paper and Derex’s
   postdoctoral adviser at Arizona State University from 2014 to 2017,
   still thinks that, on balance, the evidence tilts toward a cultural
   niche. He recounts an experiment he conducted with Derex in 2015 that
   suggested that as technical inputs grow more complex, social learning
   prevails over an inventor toiling alone. That earlier study, performed
   on computers, required participants to construct virtual totem poles.
   To do so, they had to perform elaborate tasks such as building tools
   that made other tools. “That experiment clearly shows that the more
   complicated you make the task, the more cumulative cultural evolution
   beats individual learning—if you compare people who have social input
   and people who don’t,” Boyd says.

   The wheel study brings up other issues. In future experiments, Derex
   wants to investigate an idea that emerged from observing how knowledge
   is transmitted across generations: participants who conveyed a
   partially correct theory to colleagues in a chain (optimizing the wheel
   for inertia but not center of mass, for instance) improved their
   performance—but that enhancement inhibited further thinking about still
   better options that might be achieved by changing the center of mass as
   well. “They get stuck with a partially correct solution,” Derex says.
   That result raises the provocative question of whether, in some
   situations, teaching itself may be counterproductive because it
   constrains future innovation.
