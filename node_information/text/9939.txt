Pink is for Boys by Robb Pearlman, Illustrated by Eda Kaban
       / 0 Comments
       Pink is for Boys     A little guy, who is now a young man, once
       told me, when I complimented him on his blue nail polish that “Blue
       is for everyone” and I never forgot that thought. Why? Because it’s
       true. Colors don’t belong to people. Pink is for Boys is the cutest
       ding dang book I’ve seen all year! I’m not sure when colors began
       as boy or girl colors but I think it’s a ridiculous practice that
       should have ended decades ago. What Pink is for Boys points out is
       that colors are for everyone! The opening illustrations show
       children of all ethnicities wearing pink clothes in…

Crossover by Kwame Alexander

       Crossover by Kwame Alexander   I cannot get enough of this friggin
       fraggin great book! This is a book that I downloaded on audio and
       listened to. Twice. Back To back. Thanks to a friend, I knew about
       the ending but still. When it happens. All. The. Feels. All the
       feels. if you wanna see my review, click here. It’s so good I just
       HAD to make sure I reminded you about it for Black History Month.
       Crossover appeals to everyone of every color and every belief
       system. To be sure, I know very little about basketball, but that’s
       not even necessary. Alexander’s descriptions seep into your head
       and you can see…

Once you Read I am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter by Erika L Sanchez
You’ll NEVER be the Same!
       / 0 Comments
       I am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter I LOVE THIS BOOK!! I
       couldn’t love this book any harder if I tried! Sanchez brings out
       alot of sensitive issues in this YA book. Perfect Mexican daughters
       do not go away to college. And they do not move out of their
       parents’ house after high school graduation. Perfect Mexican
       daughters never abandon their family. But Julia is not your perfect
       Mexican daughter. That was Olga’s role. Then a tragic accident on
       the busiest street in Chicago leaves Olga dead and Julia left
       behind to reassemble the shattered pieces of her family. And no one
       seems to acknowledge that Julia is broken, too.…

       bad reputation for no good reason. Feminism does not mean the act
       of hating men. It means fighting for the rights of women making
       sure they are provided with equal opportunities. We all want to be
       treated as equals, right?

Have you Read Harbor Me by Jacqueline Woodson?

       Harbor Me by Jacqueline Woodson How much do we love Jacqueline
       Woodson? Infinity. Thats how much we love her. Her books are always
       timely and Harbor Me is no exception.  This thin, powerful book
       will hook you from word one. It all starts when six kids have to
       meet for a weekly chat—by themselves, with no adults to listen in.
       There, in the room they soon dub the ARTT Room (short for “A Room
       to Talk”), they discover it’s safe to talk about what’s bothering
       them—everything from Esteban’s father’s deportation and Haley’s
       father’s incarceration to Amari’s fears of racial profiling and
       Ashton’s adjustment to his changing family fortunes. When the…

Me, Myself & Him by Chris Tebbetts. LOOOOOOOOOOOOVE.
       / Comments Off on Me, Myself & Him by Chris Tebbetts.
       LOOOOOOOOOOOOVE.
       Me, Myself and Him   Here’s a book that you need but don’t know you
       need. Why is that? Because #1 if you’re looking for books
       containing an LGBTQ hero, here’s your book. But not because it’s
       your typical Coming Out. Story. While those are important, we’re
       past that. We need books where the kids are out and they’re living
       their lives (not everyone is Tiny Dancer, even though we love him
       too). The problem with LGBTQ kids living their lives in Me, Myself,
       and Him is that there are alternating realities in this book.
       Whaaaaaaaaaat? Yep. So if you don’t like the first timeline, hang
       around til the next…

The Orphan Band of Springdale by Anne Nesbet a #Cybils middle grade finalist
       / Comments Off on The Orphan Band of Springdale by Anne Nesbet a
       #Cybils middle grade finalist
       The Orphan Band of Springdale by Anne Nesbet So much packed into
       The Orphan Band of Springdale. It covers so many issues yet still
       manages to be a tender, touching story. It’s 1941, and tensions are
       rising in the United States as the Second World War rages in
       Europe. Eleven-year-old Gusta’s life, like the world around her, is
       about to change. Her father, a foreign-born labor organizer, has
       had to flee the country, and Gusta has been sent to live in an
       orphanage run by her grandmother. Nearsighted, snaggletoothed Gusta
       arrives in Springdale, Maine, lugging her one precious possession:
       a beloved old French horn, her sole memento of her father.…
