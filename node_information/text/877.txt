Navitas: World’s First GaN Power ICs Leave Silicon Behind

   AllGaN™ monolithic integration of GaN power FETs with drive and logic
   enables 10x-100x higher frequency to set new benchmarks in power
   density, energy efficiency and system cost
   March 16, 2016 07:10 AM Eastern Daylight Time

   EL SEGUNDO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Navitas Semiconductor today
   announced the world’s first Gallium Nitride (GaN) Power ICs, using its
   proprietary AllGaN™ monolithically-integrated 650V platform. Combining
   GaN power FETs with GaN logic and drive circuits enables 10x-100x
   higher switching frequency than existing silicon circuits, making power
   electronics smaller, lighter and lower cost. A new generation of high
   frequency, energy efficient converters is being enabled for smartphone
   and laptop chargers, OLED TVs, LED lighting, solar inverters, wireless
   charging devices and datacenters.

   “GaN has tremendous potential to displace silicon in the power
   electronics market given its inherent high-speed, high-efficiency
   capabilities as a power FET,” says Dan Kinzer, Navitas CTO & COO.
   “Previously, that potential was limited by the lack of equally high
   performance circuits to drive the GaN FETs quickly and cost
   effectively. Navitas has solved this remaining challenge to unlock the
   full potential of the power GaN market. With monolithic integration of
   GaN drive and logic circuits with GaN power FETs, the industry now has
   a path to cost-effective, easy-to-use, high-frequency power system
   designs.”

   CEO Gene Sheridan added, “The last time power electronics experienced a
   dramatic improvement in density, efficiency and cost was in the late
   70s when silicon MOSFETs replaced bipolar transistors, enabling a
   transition from linear regulators to switching regulators. A 10x
   improvement in density, 3x reduction in power losses and 3x lower cost
   resulted a short time thereafter. A similar market disruption is about
   to occur in which GaN power ICs will enable low-frequency,
   silicon-based power systems to be replaced by high-frequency GaN with
   dramatic improvements in density, efficiency and cost. This is an
   exciting time for the industry.”

   Navitas will introduce the AllGaN platform and GaN Power ICs in a
   keynote titled “Breaking Speed Limits with GaN Power ICs” at the
   Applied Power Electronics Conference (APEC) on Monday 21^st March.

Strategy Analytics: Apple Watch Captures Half of 18 Million Global Smartwatch
Shipments in Q4 2018

   February 27, 2019 09:09 PM Eastern Standard Time

   BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--According to the latest research from Strategy
   Analytics, global smartwatch shipments grew an impressive 56 percent
   annually to reach a record 18 million units in the fourth quarter of
   2018. Apple Watch maintained first position with 51 percent global
   smartwatch marketshare, while Samsung jumped to second place,
   overtaking Fitbit and Garmin.

   Steven Waltzer, Industry Analyst at Strategy Analytics, said, “Global
   smartwatch shipments grew an impressive 56 percent annually from 11.6
   million units in Q4 2017 to a record 18.2 million in Q4 2018. Global
   smartwatch shipments hit an all-time high of 45.0 million units in
   full-year 2018. Smartwatch growth is soaring, as consumers seek to
   accessorize their smartphones and bring digital connectivity to their
   wrists.”

   Neil Mawston, Executive Director at Strategy Analytics, added, “Apple
   shipped 9.2 million smartwatches worldwide in Q4 2018, rising 18
   percent from 7.8 million units in Q4 2017. Apple’s global smartwatch
   marketshare slipped to 51 percent this quarter, down from 67 percent a
   year ago. Apple Watch is losing marketshare to Samsung and Fitbit,
   whose rival smartwatch portfolios and retail presence have improved
   significantly in the past year.”

   shipped 2.4 million smartwatches worldwide and captured 13 percent
   global smartwatch marketshare in Q4 2018, rising strongly from 5
   percent marketshare a year ago. Samsung is once again the world’s
   second largest smartwatch brand. Its new Galaxy Watch proved popular in
   North America and Asia. Samsung has a good pipeline of new models for
   2019, such as the innovative Galaxy Watch Active with blood-pressure
   tracking, and Samsung should perform well this year.”

   Neil Mawston, Executive Director at Strategy Analytics, added, “Fitbit
   captured 13 percent global smartwatch marketshare in Q4 2018, tripling
   from 4 percent in Q4 2017. Fitbit is becoming established as a top-tier
   smartwatch brand. Fitbit is very popular in the United States market.
   Fitbit’s Versa smartwatches are gaining mass-appeal and its new Fitbit
   Care connected health platform is a useful differentiator for the
   brand. Garmin held fourth position and captured 6 percent worldwide
   smartwatch marketshare during Q4 2018, holding steady from 6 percent a
   year ago. Rising competition from Fitbit, Samsung and others in the
   sports and music categories is making it harder for Garmin to make
   headway in smartwatches. Combined together, Apple, Samsung, Fitbit and
   Garmin are the big four players, accounting for 8 in 10 of all
   smartwatches shipped worldwide.”

Navitas: World’s First GaN Power ICs Leave Silicon Behind

   AllGaN™ monolithic integration of GaN power FETs with drive and logic
   enables 10x-100x higher frequency to set new benchmarks in power
   density, energy efficiency and system cost
   March 16, 2016 07:10 AM Eastern Daylight Time

   EL SEGUNDO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Navitas Semiconductor today
   announced the world’s first Gallium Nitride (GaN) Power ICs, using its
   proprietary AllGaN™ monolithically-integrated 650V platform. Combining
   GaN power FETs with GaN logic and drive circuits enables 10x-100x
   higher switching frequency than existing silicon circuits, making power
   electronics smaller, lighter and lower cost. A new generation of high
   frequency, energy efficient converters is being enabled for smartphone
   and laptop chargers, OLED TVs, LED lighting, solar inverters, wireless
   charging devices and datacenters.

   “GaN has tremendous potential to displace silicon in the power
   electronics market given its inherent high-speed, high-efficiency
   capabilities as a power FET,” says Dan Kinzer, Navitas CTO & COO.
   “Previously, that potential was limited by the lack of equally high
   performance circuits to drive the GaN FETs quickly and cost
   effectively. Navitas has solved this remaining challenge to unlock the
   full potential of the power GaN market. With monolithic integration of
   GaN drive and logic circuits with GaN power FETs, the industry now has
   a path to cost-effective, easy-to-use, high-frequency power system
   designs.”

   CEO Gene Sheridan added, “The last time power electronics experienced a
   dramatic improvement in density, efficiency and cost was in the late
   70s when silicon MOSFETs replaced bipolar transistors, enabling a
   transition from linear regulators to switching regulators. A 10x
   improvement in density, 3x reduction in power losses and 3x lower cost
   resulted a short time thereafter. A similar market disruption is about
   to occur in which GaN power ICs will enable low-frequency,
   silicon-based power systems to be replaced by high-frequency GaN with
   dramatic improvements in density, efficiency and cost. This is an
   exciting time for the industry.”

   Navitas will introduce the AllGaN platform and GaN Power ICs in a
   keynote titled “Breaking Speed Limits with GaN Power ICs” at the
   Applied Power Electronics Conference (APEC) on Monday 21^st March.

   About Navitas:

   Navitas Semiconductor Inc. is the world’s first and only GaN Power IC
   company, founded in El Segundo, CA, USA in 2013. Navitas has a strong

Strategy Analytics: Apple Watch Captures Half of 18 Million Global Smartwatch
Shipments in Q4 2018

   February 27, 2019 09:09 PM Eastern Standard Time

   BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--According to the latest research from Strategy
   Analytics, global smartwatch shipments grew an impressive 56 percent
   annually to reach a record 18 million units in the fourth quarter of
   2018. Apple Watch maintained first position with 51 percent global
   smartwatch marketshare, while Samsung jumped to second place,
   overtaking Fitbit and Garmin.

   Steven Waltzer, Industry Analyst at Strategy Analytics, said, “Global
   smartwatch shipments grew an impressive 56 percent annually from 11.6
   million units in Q4 2017 to a record 18.2 million in Q4 2018. Global
   smartwatch shipments hit an all-time high of 45.0 million units in
   full-year 2018. Smartwatch growth is soaring, as consumers seek to
   accessorize their smartphones and bring digital connectivity to their
   wrists.”

   Neil Mawston, Executive Director at Strategy Analytics, added, “Apple
   shipped 9.2 million smartwatches worldwide in Q4 2018, rising 18
   percent from 7.8 million units in Q4 2017. Apple’s global smartwatch
   marketshare slipped to 51 percent this quarter, down from 67 percent a
   year ago. Apple Watch is losing marketshare to Samsung and Fitbit,
   whose rival smartwatch portfolios and retail presence have improved

   the world.”

   SD Express keeps pace with growing performance levels of mobile and
   client computing, imaging and automotive as they adopt faster
   communication and embedded storage protocols designed to make
   processing data faster.

   “With SD Express we’re offering an entirely new level of memory card
   with faster protocols turning cards into a removable SSD,” said
   Hiroyuki Sakamoto, SDA president. “SD 7.0 delivers revolutionary
   innovations to anticipate the needs of forthcoming devices and content
   rich and speed hungry applications.”

   “PCI-SIG is pleased to have teamed with the SDA to collaborate on this
   innovation for the world’s leading removable memory card – SD,” said Al
