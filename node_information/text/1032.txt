   OATAO is an open access repository that collects the work of Toulouse
   researchers and makes it freely available over the web where possible.
   It can include articles, book chapters, reports, conference papers,
   etc...
   The deposit of research papers in institutional repositories like OATAO
   is a complement to the traditional academic publishing and scholarly
   communication processes. Institutional repositories raise the
   visibility of research and helps to maximise its impact.

   Please note: This is not a complete record of research publications of
                            Toulouse researchers.

            By now, there are 17581 eprints in our open archive.
