   The Origin Point Of Antarctica's Blood Falls Has Been Revealed

   The Blood Falls of Antarctica are weird, but not inexplicable. Tumbling
   out of the Taylor Glacier, they aren’t a sign of the coming apocalypse
   or the Rapture – it’s a form of meltwater that is tainted by iron
   oxide, essentially rust, that ekes out of small fissures in the ice.

   The color was initially thought to have come from red algae, which
   certainly does exist – however, it could be explained by a strange
   quirk of geochemistry, where iron particles in unfrozen saltwater
   become oxidized when they flow up the surface and make contact with the
   atmosphere.

   The bewitching Blood Falls were discovered for the first time all the
   way back in 1911, but the genesis and the path of the source river
   remained shrouded in mystery for generations. The former, clearly, has
   been solved, and now it looks like the latter has been too.

   According to a new study in the Journal of Glaciology, it appears that
   the red river first emerges from a saltwater lake trapped beneath the
   1.5-4-million-year-old Taylor Glacier. The team led by Colorado College
   and the University of Alaska Fairbanks spotted the source of the
   crimson brine using penetrating radar methods to see through the thick
   layers of overlying ice.

   Far from there being just a single concealed river, it appears Taylor
   Glacier is sitting atop a complex network of them, all acting as a
   drainage system in unison. The brine appears to be injected into the
   ice, and forced up to the Blood Falls through cracks, under immense
   pressure.

   Saltwater has a lower freezing point than freshwater, but the glacier’s
   temperatures are so low that researchers have been puzzled as to how
   it’s managing to flow through it without solidifying. This new study
   explains that the saltwater releases latent heat as it freezes, which
   melts the surrounding ice and allows it to quickly flow through.

   This makes Taylor Glacier the coldest glacier on Earth to feature
   constantly flowing water. More significantly, this means that Blood
   Falls are at least a million years old, perhaps older.

   ^Modeling shows that the brine is forcing its way through the Taylor
   Glacier through multiple paths, all the way up to Blood Falls
   (magnified, inset). Badgeley et al./Journal of Glaciology

   Thanks to scientific curiosity, the mystery of Blood Falls is being
   stripped away year by year, but this peculiar phenomenon’s inherent
   weirdness looks set to become more pronounced over time. For example, a
   rather strange microbial system, one that makes use of the sulfates and
   iron oxides present in the water to produce energy, has also been
   detected in Blood Falls.

   Back in 2009, researchers clocked at least 17 different varieties of
   microbes all living in an essentially deoxygenated environment, and
   several of them use energy-production processes that were previously
   unknown to science. So Blood Falls, an extremely strange place, has
   actual extremophiles living in it.

   Great Apes Have Just Passed A Complex 'Theory Of Mind' Test

   What separates humans from “the beasts” of nature? One of the few
   standout features of human intelligence is often argued to be our
   ability to deeply understand the desires, knowledge, motives, and
   intents of others. Known as “theory of mind”, this ability allows us to
   understand and anticipate the thoughts of others, even when they are
   different or opposed to one’s own.

   Many have pushed the idea that humans are the only creatures to possess
   this complex ability, however, a new study on our closest evolutionary
   cousins is now shaking this longheld assumption.

   Reporting their findings in the Proceedings of the National Academy of
   Sciences, an international team of researchers from Kyoto University in
   Japan, the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in
   Germany, and the University of St Andrews in Scotland has demonstrated
   that other members of the great ape family – including chimpanzees,
   bonobos, and orangutans – appear to possess “theory of mind.”

   While this is not the first study to argue this, the new research
   builds on the team's previous work to provide some of the most
   convincing arguments yet.

   They reached this conclusion through a series of experiments on 47
   captive great apes – 29 chimpanzees, 14 bonobos, and four orangutans –
   at sanctuaries in Japan and Germany.

   In the first test, the ape observed a film that showed a human actor
   being tricked into thinking an object was hidden in a box. After the
   human watched the object be put in the box, they went behind a screen,
   after which the object was moved. So, the ape knew the object was not
   in the box, but the human still thought it was there. Using
   eye-tracking technology to record their gaze, it appeared that the ape
   anticipated the human’s false belief that the object was still in the
   box (even though they were aware it was not).

   IFRAME: //www.youtube.com/embed/oPPloZynLNg

   To dig deeper into whether this displayed true “theory of mind”, they
   set up another scenario that was a little bit more confusing. The apes
   were randomly split into two groups and familiarized with one of two
   types of screen: a barrier made of an opaque material and a “trick”
   barrier (one which appears to be opaque from a distance but becomes
   transparent up close).

   The apes watched a new film with the same premise as the first, but
   with the two new screens at play. As expected, the apes who were used
   to the opaque barrier anticipated that the human would search for the
   object under the box where it was last seen. However, the other apes
   were able to anticipate that the human would go to neither location, as
   the object had been removed entirely, and both parties were aware of
   this.

   This sharp ability to predict the actions of someone else – even taking
   into account their different perspectives, knowledge, and intent –
   shows a remarkable level of intelligence and, according to the team,
   provides evidence that apes possess “theory of mind.”

   “We are excited to find that great apes actually passed this difficult
   test," study author Fumihiro Kano, of Kyoto University's Kumamoto
   Sanctuary and Primate Research Institute, said in a statement. "The
   results suggest that we share this ability with our evolutionary
   cousins. We plan to continue refining our methods to test further
   non-mentalistic alternatives to the theory of mind in nonhuman
   animals."

   More than a handful of muscles that "disappeared" more than 250 million
   years ago have been found – not in gym-buff humans but in embryos
   during their first couple of months curled in their mother's womb.
   Evolution is as complex as it is beautiful, but it is evidence likes
   this that points a finger to a legacy of changes throughout the history
   of life on Earth.

   The team managed to capture the process using a new technology that
   creates high-resolution 3D images from immunostained embryos and
   fetuses within the first trimester of gestation. They found that at 7
   weeks of gestation (when the fetus is the size of a blueberry), there
   are around 30 muscles in the hand. By week 13 (size of a lemon), 10 of
   them are fused and the number of muscles drop to 20. A select few of
   these even disappeared during the transition from reptiles to mammals.

   "It used to be that we had more understanding of the early development
   of fishes, frogs, chicken and mice than in our own species, but these
   new techniques allow us to see human development in much greater
   detail," said Dr Rui Diogo, from Howard University, in a statement.
   "What is fascinating is that we observed various muscles that have
   never been described in human prenatal development, and that some of
   these atavistic muscles were seen even in 11.5-week-old fetuses, which
   is strikingly late for developmental atavisms."

   The team were able to capture a detailed timetable of the appearance of
   these muscles, as well as their splitting, fusion, or loss during the
   growth and development of the embryo. The muscles that fused are called
   atavistic limb muscles, formed during early human development and then
   gone prior to our shrieking entrance into the world. It provides an
   interesting view on evolution – we often see ourselves as becoming
   progressively more complex, but some anatomical features streamline and
   become more simple.

   "It is in fact instead a story of anatomical simplification," Dr Diogo
   told IFLScience. "Mainly muscles are lost, bones are lost.. an adult
   human has in fact less muscles and bones in the body, in total, than an
   adult mice, or an adult lizard."

   "Interestingly, some of the atavistic muscles are found on rare
   occasions in adults, either as anatomical variations without any
   noticeable effect for the healthy individual, or as the result of
   congenital malformations," added Diogo, who is lead author of the study
   published in the journal Development.

   One example of an atavistic muscle found in adults is opponens digiti
   minimi of the foot. It is present in apes, helping them move their
   feet with a moble, precise big toe. Humans lost such a digit in
   evolution, but it's present in embryos and, on rare occasions, as an
   anomaly in humans.

   "This reinforces the idea that both muscle variations and pathologies
   can be related to delayed or arrested embryonic development, in this
   case perhaps a delay or decrease of muscle apoptosis, and helps to
   explain why these muscles are occasionally found in adult people. It
   provides a fascinating, powerful example of evolution at play."

   They also found “a striking difference” in the order of muscle
   development in the arms versus legs, suggesting the similarity is
   derived. "It means that what most people assume, that the similarities
   between the upper limb and lower limb are due to an ancestral
   similarity of these two regions of the body, is likely not true: the
   similarity of the upper and lower limbs actually became more prominent
   during the evolution of these limbs, than it was in the first fish with
   pectoral and pelvic fins, from which the upper and lower limbs arose,
   respectively."

   NASA Chief Scientist: “We’re Close To Finding Life On Mars But We’re
   Not Ready”

   Is there life on Mars? A question everyone from Carl Sagan to HG Wells
   to Bowie has sought the answer to – and we may finally be close to
   getting an answer, but the world is not ready for it, according to
   NASA’s chief scientist.

   Next year, two planned missions to send rovers to Mars will drill deep
   into the surface in the search for extraterrestrial life, which means
   we could find out the answer in the next couple of years. If we are
   successful it will be “revolutionary,” but we’re not prepared for this
   momentous occasion, Dr Jim Green, director of NASA's Planetary Science
   Division, warned.

   “I’ve been worried about that because I think we’re close to finding it
   and making some announcements,” Dr Green said in an interview with The
   Sunday Telegraph. “It will start a whole new line of thinking. I don’t
   think we’re prepared for the results.”

   In 2020, Earth and Mars will be at a close approach, opening a prime
   window for mission launches, something that five space agencies are
   taking advantage of. China and the United Arabic Emirates are preparing
   for their first trips, launching an orbiter and rover, and an orbiter,
   respectively.

   NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) in partnership with Russia’s
   Roscosmos are both sending rovers to drill for samples, hoping to find
   organic matter. NASA’s Mars 2020 rover will drill into rock formations
   to collect samples and send them back to Earth – the first time
   material from Mars will visit our planet. ESA’s Rosalind Franklin rover
   will also drill for samples, crushing up and analyzing them in
   Roscosmos' stationary surface laboratory while there.

   Dr Green thinks both could be successful, and if they are it would be
   akin to Copernicus stating in the 1500s that Earth goes around the Sun,
   not the other way around, and how after that we had to reconsider
   everything we knew. Which is why he thinks Earth is not prepared for
   what happens if we do.

   “What happens next is a whole new set of scientific questions. Is that
   life like us? How are we related? Can life move from planet to planet
   or do we have a spark and just the right environment and that spark
   generates life – like us or not like us – based on the chemical
   environment that it is in?” he said.

   NASA’s Mars 2020 rover is due to land on the Red Planet's surface on
   February 18, 2021, with ESA’s Rosalind Franklin rover arriving one
   month later in March 2021. Both are searching in the vicinity of an
   ancient lake or ocean bed that once held water – so crucial for life –
   and may now be rich in clay. NASA's chosen landing site is the Jezero
   Crater delta, a 49-kilometer-wide (30-mile) crater once thought to have
   been flooded with water, and now a clay-rich delta. The ExoMars mission
   hasn't finalized its landing site yet but it announced last year its
   preferred site is Oxia Planum, a site rich in iron-magnesium clay, a
   sign water was once present.

   Mars is not the only place with the potential to have once held
   water, including places scientists hadn't thought possible before. It
   was recently revealed that Venus, Earth's hellish twin, may have once
   had water 3 billion years ago before its atmosphere became incredibly
   dense and hot 700 million years ago.

   “There is no reason to think that there isn’t civilisations elsewhere,
   because we are finding exoplanets all over the place," Dr Green
   said. “This concept of what a ‘Goldilocks Zone’ looks like has to be
   modified.”

   The Origin Point Of Antarctica's Blood Falls Has Been Revealed

   The Blood Falls of Antarctica are weird, but not inexplicable. Tumbling
   out of the Taylor Glacier, they aren’t a sign of the coming apocalypse
   or the Rapture – it’s a form of meltwater that is tainted by iron
   oxide, essentially rust, that ekes out of small fissures in the ice.

   The color was initially thought to have come from red algae, which
   certainly does exist – however, it could be explained by a strange
   quirk of geochemistry, where iron particles in unfrozen saltwater
   become oxidized when they flow up the surface and make contact with the
   atmosphere.

   The bewitching Blood Falls were discovered for the first time all the
   way back in 1911, but the genesis and the path of the source river
   remained shrouded in mystery for generations. The former, clearly, has
   been solved, and now it looks like the latter has been too.

   According to a new study in the Journal of Glaciology, it appears that
   the red river first emerges from a saltwater lake trapped beneath the
   1.5-4-million-year-old Taylor Glacier. The team led by Colorado College
   and the University of Alaska Fairbanks spotted the source of the
   crimson brine using penetrating radar methods to see through the thick
   layers of overlying ice.

   Far from there being just a single concealed river, it appears Taylor
   Glacier is sitting atop a complex network of them, all acting as a
   drainage system in unison. The brine appears to be injected into the
   ice, and forced up to the Blood Falls through cracks, under immense
   pressure.

   Saltwater has a lower freezing point than freshwater, but the glacier’s
   temperatures are so low that researchers have been puzzled as to how
   it’s managing to flow through it without solidifying. This new study
   explains that the saltwater releases latent heat as it freezes, which
   melts the surrounding ice and allows it to quickly flow through.

   This makes Taylor Glacier the coldest glacier on Earth to feature
   constantly flowing water. More significantly, this means that Blood
   Falls are at least a million years old, perhaps older.

   ^Modeling shows that the brine is forcing its way through the Taylor
   Glacier through multiple paths, all the way up to Blood Falls
   (magnified, inset). Badgeley et al./Journal of Glaciology

   Thanks to scientific curiosity, the mystery of Blood Falls is being
   stripped away year by year, but this peculiar phenomenon’s inherent
   weirdness looks set to become more pronounced over time. For example, a
   rather strange microbial system, one that makes use of the sulfates and
   iron oxides present in the water to produce energy, has also been
   detected in Blood Falls.

   Back in 2009, researchers clocked at least 17 different varieties of
   microbes all living in an essentially deoxygenated environment, and
   several of them use energy-production processes that were previously
   unknown to science. So Blood Falls, an extremely strange place, has
   actual extremophiles living in it.

   Great Apes Have Just Passed A Complex 'Theory Of Mind' Test

   What separates humans from “the beasts” of nature? One of the few
   standout features of human intelligence is often argued to be our
   ability to deeply understand the desires, knowledge, motives, and
   intents of others. Known as “theory of mind”, this ability allows us to
   understand and anticipate the thoughts of others, even when they are
   different or opposed to one’s own.

   Many have pushed the idea that humans are the only creatures to possess
   this complex ability, however, a new study on our closest evolutionary
   cousins is now shaking this longheld assumption.

   Reporting their findings in the Proceedings of the National Academy of
   Sciences, an international team of researchers from Kyoto University in
   Japan, the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in
   Germany, and the University of St Andrews in Scotland has demonstrated
   that other members of the great ape family – including chimpanzees,
   bonobos, and orangutans – appear to possess “theory of mind.”

   While this is not the first study to argue this, the new research
   builds on the team's previous work to provide some of the most
   convincing arguments yet.

   They reached this conclusion through a series of experiments on 47
   captive great apes – 29 chimpanzees, 14 bonobos, and four orangutans –
   at sanctuaries in Japan and Germany.

   In the first test, the ape observed a film that showed a human actor
   being tricked into thinking an object was hidden in a box. After the
   human watched the object be put in the box, they went behind a screen,
   after which the object was moved. So, the ape knew the object was not
   in the box, but the human still thought it was there. Using
   eye-tracking technology to record their gaze, it appeared that the ape
   anticipated the human’s false belief that the object was still in the
   box (even though they were aware it was not).

   To dig deeper into whether this displayed true “theory of mind”, they
   set up another scenario that was a little bit more confusing. The apes
   were randomly split into two groups and familiarized with one of two
   types of screen: a barrier made of an opaque material and a “trick”
   barrier (one which appears to be opaque from a distance but becomes
   transparent up close).

   The apes watched a new film with the same premise as the first, but
   with the two new screens at play. As expected, the apes who were used
   to the opaque barrier anticipated that the human would search for the
   object under the box where it was last seen. However, the other apes
   were able to anticipate that the human would go to neither location, as
   the object had been removed entirely, and both parties were aware of
   this.

   This sharp ability to predict the actions of someone else – even taking
   into account their different perspectives, knowledge, and intent –
   shows a remarkable level of intelligence and, according to the team,
   provides evidence that apes possess “theory of mind.”

   “We are excited to find that great apes actually passed this difficult
   test," study author Fumihiro Kano, of Kyoto University's Kumamoto
   Sanctuary and Primate Research Institute, said in a statement. "The
   results suggest that we share this ability with our evolutionary
   cousins. We plan to continue refining our methods to test further
   non-mentalistic alternatives to the theory of mind in nonhuman
   animals."

   More than a handful of muscles that "disappeared" more than 250 million
   years ago have been found – not in gym-buff humans but in embryos
   during their first couple of months curled in their mother's womb.
   Evolution is as complex as it is beautiful, but it is evidence likes
   this that points a finger to a legacy of changes throughout the history
   of life on Earth.

   The team managed to capture the process using a new technology that
   creates high-resolution 3D images from immunostained embryos and
   fetuses within the first trimester of gestation. They found that at 7
   weeks of gestation (when the fetus is the size of a blueberry), there
   are around 30 muscles in the hand. By week 13 (size of a lemon), 10 of
   them are fused and the number of muscles drop to 20. A select few of
   these even disappeared during the transition from reptiles to mammals.

   "It used to be that we had more understanding of the early development
   of fishes, frogs, chicken and mice than in our own species, but these
   new techniques allow us to see human development in much greater
   detail," said Dr Rui Diogo, from Howard University, in a statement.
   "What is fascinating is that we observed various muscles that have
   never been described in human prenatal development, and that some of
   these atavistic muscles were seen even in 11.5-week-old fetuses, which
   is strikingly late for developmental atavisms."

   The team were able to capture a detailed timetable of the appearance of
   these muscles, as well as their splitting, fusion, or loss during the
   growth and development of the embryo. The muscles that fused are called
   atavistic limb muscles, formed during early human development and then
   gone prior to our shrieking entrance into the world. It provides an
   interesting view on evolution – we often see ourselves as becoming
   progressively more complex, but some anatomical features streamline and
   become more simple.

   "It is in fact instead a story of anatomical simplification," Dr Diogo
   told IFLScience. "Mainly muscles are lost, bones are lost.. an adult
   human has in fact less muscles and bones in the body, in total, than an
   adult mice, or an adult lizard."

   "Interestingly, some of the atavistic muscles are found on rare
   occasions in adults, either as anatomical variations without any
   noticeable effect for the healthy individual, or as the result of
   congenital malformations," added Diogo, who is lead author of the study
   published in the journal Development.

   One example of an atavistic muscle found in adults is opponens digiti
   minimi of the foot. It is present in apes, helping them move their
   feet with a moble, precise big toe. Humans lost such a digit in
   evolution, but it's present in embryos and, on rare occasions, as an
   anomaly in humans.

   "This reinforces the idea that both muscle variations and pathologies
   can be related to delayed or arrested embryonic development, in this
   case perhaps a delay or decrease of muscle apoptosis, and helps to
   explain why these muscles are occasionally found in adult people. It
   provides a fascinating, powerful example of evolution at play."

   They also found “a striking difference” in the order of muscle
   development in the arms versus legs, suggesting the similarity is
   derived. "It means that what most people assume, that the similarities
   between the upper limb and lower limb are due to an ancestral
   similarity of these two regions of the body, is likely not true: the
   similarity of the upper and lower limbs actually became more prominent
   during the evolution of these limbs, than it was in the first fish with
   pectoral and pelvic fins, from which the upper and lower limbs arose,
   respectively."

   NASA Chief Scientist: “We’re Close To Finding Life On Mars But We’re

   Is there life on Mars? A question everyone from Carl Sagan to HG Wells
   to Bowie has sought the answer to – and we may finally be close to
   getting an answer, but the world is not ready for it, according to
   NASA’s chief scientist.

   Next year, two planned missions to send rovers to Mars will drill deep
   into the surface in the search for extraterrestrial life, which means
   we could find out the answer in the next couple of years. If we are
   successful it will be “revolutionary,” but we’re not prepared for this
   momentous occasion, Dr Jim Green, director of NASA's Planetary Science
   Division, warned.

   “I’ve been worried about that because I think we’re close to finding it
   and making some announcements,” Dr Green said in an interview with The
   Sunday Telegraph. “It will start a whole new line of thinking. I don’t
   think we’re prepared for the results.”

   In 2020, Earth and Mars will be at a close approach, opening a prime
   window for mission launches, something that five space agencies are
   taking advantage of. China and the United Arabic Emirates are preparing
   for their first trips, launching an orbiter and rover, and an orbiter,
   respectively.

   NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) in partnership with Russia’s
   Roscosmos are both sending rovers to drill for samples, hoping to find
   organic matter. NASA’s Mars 2020 rover will drill into rock formations
   to collect samples and send them back to Earth – the first time
   material from Mars will visit our planet. ESA’s Rosalind Franklin rover
   will also drill for samples, crushing up and analyzing them in
   Roscosmos' stationary surface laboratory while there.

   Dr Green thinks both could be successful, and if they are it would be
   akin to Copernicus stating in the 1500s that Earth goes around the Sun,
   not the other way around, and how after that we had to reconsider
   everything we knew. Which is why he thinks Earth is not prepared for
   what happens if we do.

   “What happens next is a whole new set of scientific questions. Is that
   life like us? How are we related? Can life move from planet to planet
   or do we have a spark and just the right environment and that spark
   generates life – like us or not like us – based on the chemical
   environment that it is in?” he said.

   NASA’s Mars 2020 rover is due to land on the Red Planet's surface on
   February 18, 2021, with ESA’s Rosalind Franklin rover arriving one
   month later in March 2021. Both are searching in the vicinity of an
   ancient lake or ocean bed that once held water – so crucial for life –
   and may now be rich in clay. NASA's chosen landing site is the Jezero
   Crater delta, a 49-kilometer-wide (30-mile) crater once thought to have
   been flooded with water, and now a clay-rich delta. The ExoMars mission
   hasn't finalized its landing site yet but it announced last year its
   preferred site is Oxia Planum, a site rich in iron-magnesium clay, a
   sign water was once present.

   Mars is not the only place with the potential to have once held
   water, including places scientists hadn't thought possible before. It
   was recently revealed that Venus, Earth's hellish twin, may have once
   had water 3 billion years ago before its atmosphere became incredibly
   dense and hot 700 million years ago.

   “There is no reason to think that there isn’t civilisations elsewhere,
   because we are finding exoplanets all over the place," Dr Green
   said. “This concept of what a ‘Goldilocks Zone’ looks like has to be
   modified.”
