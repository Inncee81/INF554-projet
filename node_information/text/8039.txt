Family forced to abandon new born baby in Malaysia amid Trump's chaotic
Muslim ban

Baraa Ahmed was left with no choice in the wake of the ban on travel for
Yemenis.

   It was an excruciating choice that no family should ever have to make.
   Should they stay together with their two young daughters and miss
   perhaps their only chance to escape the horrors of war, or should they
   make a break for freedom but leave their year-old baby behind in a
   foreign land half-way around the world?

   This was the devil's dilemma facing US-Yemeni dual national Baraa Ahmed
   (not his real name) and his wife, who were separated from their
   breastfeeding baby in the wake of President Trump's discriminatory
   travel ban last month.

   "I would have never left my daughter behind in Malaysia and flown back
   [to the States] if it weren't for the decision by the President.
   Nothing would have made me leave my daughter behind ... But [Trump's
   executive order] really compelled us to do what we did," Baraa Ahmed
   said.

   What brought them to entrust their baby's care to friends in Malaysia,
   a country 15,000 km away where they have no close ties?

   The American dream

   Baraa Ahmed left Yemen several years ago to seek work in the USA, and
   create a better life for his family. He settled in New York City, where
   he now works as a salesman. In 2014, he naturalised as a US citizen and
   later that year, he sponsored his wife and first daughter, now a
   toddler, for visas to join him.

   So far, the family's story sounds like that of so many others from
   around the world who work hard to create a new life in the USA. But two
   disastrous and unforeseen events have turned their American dream into
   an ongoing nightmare.

   First, Yemen's political unrest erupted into a bloody armed conflict in
   March 2015, with civilians caught up between aerial bombardment and
   ground attacks, leading to the displacement of 2 million people.

   Then, in January 2017, after rising to power on a platform of toxic
   xenophobia and division, US President Donald Trump signed an executive
   order banning everyone from Yemen and six other Muslim-majority states
   from entering the USA.

   According to Trump, the ban was aimed at keeping "terrorists" out. But
   the blatantly discriminatory measure actually sowed fear among refugees
   fleeing war and persecution, and created chaos for thousands of people
   around the world, like Baraa Ahmed's family, who were already mired in
   lengthy visa application processes and background checks.

   "Because of the conditions in Yemen, I wanted to bring my wife and
   daughter here because they were living in... one of the most affected
   areas during the war. I wanted them to be with me, but my primary
   concern was the war," said Baraa Ahmed.

   The cost of fleeing the ravages of war

   After the unrest forced the US embassy in Yemen's capital Sana'a to
   close, Baraa Ahmed arranged, at great expense, for his wife and young
   daughters to travel to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia where they could continue
   their visa application process. A male relative had to accompany them
   when they left Yemen in late March 2016, and their route took them via
   three different countries before they finally got a flight to Malaysia.

   Meanwhile Baraa Ahmed flew from New York to Kuala Lumpur to join them,
   and in the following 11 months while they awaited their visas, he
   reckons he paid out more than $40,000, on flights, flat and car rental,
   visa-related fees and other costs.

   But worse than the expense and the delay was the utter disarray. As his
   youngest daughter was born in late 2015, more than a year after he
   initially sponsored visa applications for his wife and elder daughter,
   he filed for a separate visa for her and paid for a costly paternity
   test.

   Despite multiple interviews on her case with US immigration officials
   and reassurances at several stages of the process, the baby's
   application remained separate from her family's, so when his wife and
   eldest daughter received their visas late last year, there was still no
   update on her application.

   Again, they were forced to wait.

   A family ripped apart at the stroke of a pen

   Then came the devastating news of Trump's travel ban on 27 January this
   year. When a US District Court issued a temporary stay on the executive
   order, Yemenis who had valid US visas rushed to get to the US to avoid
   the threat of being barred again. With no updates on their baby's visa,
   Baraa Ahmed and his wife faced an impossible decision – opting to fly
   to the USA, leaving their infant daughter behind.

   "I had no choice but to leave my baby with a friend and his wife and go
   back [to the US] to bring in ... my wife and elder daughter, who had
   been approved. It was a very cruel choice, but what could I have done?
   I had no other choice. I couldn't risk all of them losing their chance
   of getting in," he told Amnesty International.

   Financially stretched and awaiting his wife's and elder daughter's
   green cards to be formally issued, for now the family cannot travel
   back to Malaysia even to visit their baby.

   The ordeal has put his wife's mental health on a knife edge.

   "[The baby] was breastfeeding when she was separated from her mother. I
   am telling you the mother is like a crazy person now, she does strange
   things. She blames me, she says this is my fault. You can imagine how
   she is missing her child. Even I am truly suffering, I feel torn inside
   that I left my baby," Baraa Ahmed said.

Social media stars are paid £75,000 per Facebook post - and marketers don't
know if it works

YouTube and Snapchat accounts.

   YouTube and social media stars are paid up to £75,000 for a single
   Facebook post, £67,000 for a video and as much as £53,000 per Snapchat
   entry by UK marketers hungry for access to their millions of followers.

   The majority of marketers expect to see these costs rise over the next
   year, despite a massive 85% admitting they aren't sure how influencer
   fees are calculated. A stunning 35% say they expect spending on
   influencers to increase by over 50%.

   Over a third, 38%, of marketers cannot tell whether a particular
   campaign on an influencers social media platforms increased sales or
   not.

   The data has come from a new study by Rakuten Marketing, revealing how
   UK marketers work with the most popular users of Facebook, Instagram
   and Snapchat.

   The biggest celebrity endorsers include Kendall Jenner (82.4 million
   Instagram followers), Hailey Baldwin (10.5m followers) and Zoella
   (11.9m YouTube subscribers).

   Internet stars with millions of followers and those who work in the
   premium fashion sector can earn up to £160,000 per post, Rakuten
   claims.

   While these startling figures are reserved for celebrities with
   millions of followers keen to buy whatever they promote, even so-called
   "micro-influencers" with up to 10,000 followers can expect to be paid
   £1,500 by marketers for posting on Facebook. YouTube accounts with
   10,000 subscribers can earn up to £3,000 for a positive review,
   unboxing video or hands-on demonstration of a new product.

   But just 20% of marketers claim they are able to demonstrate the impact
   of influencers on sales. Additionally, just 29% of marketers believe
   the influencers they work with "are entirely concerned whether their
   content drives sales for the brand."

   Interestingly, the factor which marketers say would encourage them to
   invest more in influencers is "greater transparency and better
   reporting of influencer contribution to sales". Influencers have in the
   past been criticised for not clearly stating when they are being paid
   to promote a product, compared to genuinely describing something they
   are a fan of.

   James Collins, Rakuten Marketing's senior vice president of global
   attribution, said: "Influencer marketing can be hugely effective but
   marketers are commissioning expensive posts without understanding the
   real impact on the purchase journey. It's essential that marketers
   question influencer fees and use attribution tools to measure the
   effects of this activity in order to create strong, value-driven
   relationships between brands and influencers."
