   team to prevent rework, save time, and eliminate ambiguity when it’s
   time to build.

Connect your workflow with essential integrations

   Bring in relevant work, documentation, and resources from the design
   and development tools you already use.

Manage your design system with Enterprise-ready features

   Protect your company’s most strategic assets with complete control that

   two-factor authentication.

     "InVision DSM makes our design system’s visual organization so much
     simpler. It’s great to be able to see components fully expanded
     instead of navigating tons of dropdown lists, and have the monument
     site populate automatically."

     Manager is a huge step in this direction, and I’m looking forward to
     collaborating with the InVision team on the evolution of this

     "InVision’s DSM isn’t just about smoothing out someone’s workflow,
     it’s about enabling their voice and allowing them to play a more
     active role in the process of designing as a team. A good design
     system should empower designers instead of restricting them, and
     this tool absolutely furthers that goal."
