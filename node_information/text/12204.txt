Cable Operators’ Shift to Profit Mode Accelerates Cord-Cutting

By 2022, nearly 25% of households will drop traditional TV

   August 6, 2019 (New York, NY) – Cord-cutting in the US continues to
   accelerate, with the number of cord-cutting households jumping another
   19.2% this year. According to eMarketer’s latest pay TV forecast, the
   number of households without a traditional pay TV subscription is
   quickly approaching those that have one.

   This year, the number of pay TV households in the US will decline by
   4.2% to 86.5 million. With that negative growth rate holding relatively
   steady, the number of households subscribing to traditional pay TV
   services will drop below 80 million by 2021. At that time, more than
   one-fifth of households will be cord-cutters.

    The growth of cord-cutting could partially be inflicted by TV
   providers themselves, as many are now prioritizing profit over
   revenues. That is coming at the expense of subscribers, who often drop
   services when prices rise and promotional deals don’t get renewed.

   Satellite providers will take the biggest hit, with household
   subscriptions dropping 7.1% this year, followed by telco and cable with
   declines of 4.6% and 2.4%, respectively.

   “As programming costs continue to rise, cable, satellite and telco
   operators are finding it difficult to turn a profit on some TV
   subscriptions,” eMarketer forecasting analyst Eric Haggstrom said.
   “Their answer has been to raise prices across the board, and it seems
   that they are willing to lose customers rather than retain them with
   unprofitable deals. This has been a boon for TV providers, who also
   offer broadband internet, as it removes consumers from bundled deals.
   It forces consumers to pay a higher price for internet, which
   dramatically improves profit margins.”

   Not only is the number of TV viewers declining, but those who are still
   watching traditional TV are watching less. This year, TV time will drop
   3.0% to 3 hours and 40 minutes on average among US TV viewers. All age
   groups are showing declines in time spent watching TV, but the largest
   drops are occurring among viewers 17 and under.

   “As viewing time and the number of TV households drop, networks will
   have to sell ads at higher prices to account for lost viewership,”
   Haggstrom said. “This will become increasingly difficult to do over
   time. As a result, traditional TV networks such as Disney and NBCU are
   bulking up their direct-to-consumer [D2C] digital offerings in order to
   regain lost viewers.”

   eMarketer’s forecasts and estimates are based on an analysis of
   quantitative and qualitative data from research firms, government
   agencies, media firms and public companies, plus interviews with top

   the larger matrix of all its forecasts, with the same assumptions and
   general framework used to project figures in a wide variety of areas.

   latest business developments, technology trends and economic changes.

Brands Open Accounts on Snapchat, but Many Are Inactive

Producing compelling content may be too challenging

   January 16, 2017 | Marketing
     * Share
     * Email
     * Print

   Snapchat has become a must for many brands—especially those aiming to
   reach young consumers, who are the bulk of Snapchat's audience. New
   research found that Snapchat adoption among brands increased throughout
   2016, but many of these branded accounts were quickly abandoned.

   Share of Brands Worldwide that Have a Snapchat Account, by Vertical,
   Jan & Sep 2016 (% of total)

   According to L2, the percentage of brands that have a Snapchat account
   increased across all verticals between January and September 2016.
   Approximately 90% of active wear brands and 78% of beauty and fashion
   brands had a Snapchat account as of September 2016, while about
   two-thirds of retail and watches and jewelry brands had an account.

   Growing adoption shows that brands have been sold on Snapchat's value,
   but L2 found that many of these branded Snapchat accounts lay dormant
   once they're opened. The study pointed out that "...many brands have
   struggled to produce content for the platform. Inactivity persisted
   throughout 2016—only 70% of accounts were active (posted within the
   past month) in January 2016, and only 67% were active in October 2016."

   As eMarketer analyst Cathy Boyle explained, brands may be inactive on
   Snapchat because "Creating a brand presence on Snapchat requires a
   unique strategy. The more intimate nature of the platform means brands
   need to think carefully about a new, perhaps more personal, story they
   can tell about their brand on Snapchat than they would on Facebook or
   Instagram."

   Another reason may be that brand accounts are not found. "Unlike legacy
   social platforms, user accounts, including brand accounts, are not
   easily discoverable on Snapchat," she said.

   According to Boyle, inactivity may also be because many brands, which
   at first focused on building an organic presence on Snapchat, may be
   switching to advertising on the platform.

   Snapchat expanded its ad offerings considerably in 2016 and its revenue
   is rising rapidly. eMarketer estimated that Snapchat's worldwide
   advertising revenue will jump from $935.5 million to $1.76 billion
   between 2017 and 2018.

   Average US Time Spent with Mobile in 2019 Has Increased: US Adults
   Spend More Time on Mobile than They Do Watching TV

   For the first time ever, US consumers will spend more time using their
   mobile devices than watching TV, with smartphone use dominating that
   time spent.

   Consumers’ use of smartphones will continue to make up the majority of
   their media consumption, but we predict that use will plateau by 2020,
   as consumers become increasingly uneasy about overuse of mobile
   devices.
   [svg%3E%0A] [6710_original_lazy]

   The average US adult will spend 3 hours, 43 minutes (referenced as
   3:43) on mobile devices in 2019, just above the 3:35 spent on TV. Of
   time spent on mobile, US consumers will spend 2:55 on smartphones, a
   9-minute increase from last year. In 2018, mobile time spent was 3:35,
   with TV time spent at 3:44.

   Tablet use among US adults continues to lose ground, having peaked at
   1:11 daily in 2017 and dipped to 1:08 this year. This trend will
   continue through 2021.

   “We’ve expected that mobile would overtake TV for a while, but seeing
   it happen is still surprising," said Yoram Wurmser, eMarketer principal
   analyst. "As recently as 2014, the average US adult watched nearly 2
   hours more TV than they spent on their phones."

   What are people spending time on their devices doing? They’re
   consistently spending the bulk of their time using apps over web
   browsers, with the average person spending 2:57 in apps vs. 0:26 on a
   mobile browser.

   Within apps, people spent the most time listening to digital audio,
   followed by social network activity.

   “Digital audio apps continue to add minutes because people are
   streaming more music on their phones, and podcasts have taken off in
   popularity in the past few years,” Wurmser said.

   Longer term, smartphones will remain the dominant device for consumer
   media, but backlash continues over screen time, even if broader
   consumer behavior has not reflected these sentiments. Companies like
   Google and Apple have introduced screen time controls, but how useful
   they are in ultimately changing behavior remains to be seen.

Cable Operators’ Shift to Profit Mode Accelerates Cord-Cutting

By 2022, nearly 25% of households will drop traditional TV

   August 6, 2019 (New York, NY) – Cord-cutting in the US continues to
   accelerate, with the number of cord-cutting households jumping another
   19.2% this year. According to eMarketer’s latest pay TV forecast, the
   number of households without a traditional pay TV subscription is
   quickly approaching those that have one.

   This year, the number of pay TV households in the US will decline by
   4.2% to 86.5 million. With that negative growth rate holding relatively
   steady, the number of households subscribing to traditional pay TV
   services will drop below 80 million by 2021. At that time, more than
   one-fifth of households will be cord-cutters.

    The growth of cord-cutting could partially be inflicted by TV
   providers themselves, as many are now prioritizing profit over
   revenues. That is coming at the expense of subscribers, who often drop
   services when prices rise and promotional deals don’t get renewed.

   Satellite providers will take the biggest hit, with household
   subscriptions dropping 7.1% this year, followed by telco and cable with
   declines of 4.6% and 2.4%, respectively.

   “As programming costs continue to rise, cable, satellite and telco
   operators are finding it difficult to turn a profit on some TV
   subscriptions,” eMarketer forecasting analyst Eric Haggstrom said.
   “Their answer has been to raise prices across the board, and it seems
   that they are willing to lose customers rather than retain them with
   unprofitable deals. This has been a boon for TV providers, who also
   offer broadband internet, as it removes consumers from bundled deals.
   It forces consumers to pay a higher price for internet, which
   dramatically improves profit margins.”

   Not only is the number of TV viewers declining, but those who are still
   watching traditional TV are watching less. This year, TV time will drop
   3.0% to 3 hours and 40 minutes on average among US TV viewers. All age
   groups are showing declines in time spent watching TV, but the largest
   drops are occurring among viewers 17 and under.

   “As viewing time and the number of TV households drop, networks will
   have to sell ads at higher prices to account for lost viewership,”
   Haggstrom said. “This will become increasingly difficult to do over
   time. As a result, traditional TV networks such as Disney and NBCU are
   bulking up their direct-to-consumer [D2C] digital offerings in order to
   regain lost viewers.”

   eMarketer’s forecasts and estimates are based on an analysis of
   quantitative and qualitative data from research firms, government
   agencies, media firms and public companies, plus interviews with top
   executives at publishers, ad buyers and agencies. Data is weighted
   based on methodology and soundness. Each eMarketer forecast fits within
   the larger matrix of all its forecasts, with the same assumptions and
   general framework used to project figures in a wide variety of areas.
   Regular re-evaluation of available data means the forecasts reflect the
   latest business developments, technology trends and economic changes.

Brands Open Accounts on Snapchat, but Many Are Inactive

Producing compelling content may be too challenging

   January 16, 2017 | Marketing
     * Share
     * Email
     * Print

   Snapchat has become a must for many brands—especially those aiming to
   reach young consumers, who are the bulk of Snapchat's audience. New
   research found that Snapchat adoption among brands increased throughout
   2016, but many of these branded accounts were quickly abandoned.

   Share of Brands Worldwide that Have a Snapchat Account, by Vertical,
   Jan & Sep 2016 (% of total)

   According to L2, the percentage of brands that have a Snapchat account
   increased across all verticals between January and September 2016.
   Approximately 90% of active wear brands and 78% of beauty and fashion
   brands had a Snapchat account as of September 2016, while about
   two-thirds of retail and watches and jewelry brands had an account.

   Growing adoption shows that brands have been sold on Snapchat's value,
   but L2 found that many of these branded Snapchat accounts lay dormant
   once they're opened. The study pointed out that "...many brands have
   struggled to produce content for the platform. Inactivity persisted
   throughout 2016—only 70% of accounts were active (posted within the
   past month) in January 2016, and only 67% were active in October 2016."

   As eMarketer analyst Cathy Boyle explained, brands may be inactive on
   Snapchat because "Creating a brand presence on Snapchat requires a
   unique strategy. The more intimate nature of the platform means brands
   need to think carefully about a new, perhaps more personal, story they
   can tell about their brand on Snapchat than they would on Facebook or
   Instagram."

   Another reason may be that brand accounts are not found. "Unlike legacy
   social platforms, user accounts, including brand accounts, are not
   easily discoverable on Snapchat," she said.

   According to Boyle, inactivity may also be because many brands, which
   at first focused on building an organic presence on Snapchat, may be
   switching to advertising on the platform.

   Snapchat expanded its ad offerings considerably in 2016 and its revenue
   is rising rapidly. eMarketer estimated that Snapchat's worldwide
   advertising revenue will jump from $935.5 million to $1.76 billion
   between 2017 and 2018.

   Average US Time Spent with Mobile in 2019 Has Increased: US Adults
   Spend More Time on Mobile than They Do Watching TV

   For the first time ever, US consumers will spend more time using their
   mobile devices than watching TV, with smartphone use dominating that
   time spent.

   Consumers’ use of smartphones will continue to make up the majority of
   their media consumption, but we predict that use will plateau by 2020,
   as consumers become increasingly uneasy about overuse of mobile
   devices.
   [svg%3E%0A] [6710_original_lazy]

   The average US adult will spend 3 hours, 43 minutes (referenced as
   3:43) on mobile devices in 2019, just above the 3:35 spent on TV. Of
   time spent on mobile, US consumers will spend 2:55 on smartphones, a
   9-minute increase from last year. In 2018, mobile time spent was 3:35,
   with TV time spent at 3:44.

   Tablet use among US adults continues to lose ground, having peaked at
   1:11 daily in 2017 and dipped to 1:08 this year. This trend will
   continue through 2021.

   “We’ve expected that mobile would overtake TV for a while, but seeing
   it happen is still surprising," said Yoram Wurmser, eMarketer principal
   analyst. "As recently as 2014, the average US adult watched nearly 2
   hours more TV than they spent on their phones."

   What are people spending time on their devices doing? They’re
   consistently spending the bulk of their time using apps over web
   browsers, with the average person spending 2:57 in apps vs. 0:26 on a
   mobile browser.

   Within apps, people spent the most time listening to digital audio,
   followed by social network activity.

   “Digital audio apps continue to add minutes because people are
   streaming more music on their phones, and podcasts have taken off in
   popularity in the past few years,” Wurmser said.

   Longer term, smartphones will remain the dominant device for consumer
   media, but backlash continues over screen time, even if broader
   consumer behavior has not reflected these sentiments. Companies like
   Google and Apple have introduced screen time controls, but how useful
   they are in ultimately changing behavior remains to be seen.
