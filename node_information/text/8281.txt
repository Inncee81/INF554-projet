   For the first time since the creation of this forward-facing
   intrapreneurship program, the LVMH Group organized its DARE (Disrupt
   Act Risk to be an Entrepreneur) event in London. For three days, Group
   employees across the EMEA region – selected from 450 talents
   shortlisted following a call for ideas to  “Shaping the Customer
   Experience of Tomorrow” – joined one another to brainstorm in London.
   The fruit of their reflections was presented to a jury of executives
   from LVMH and its Maisons, along with outside entrepreneurs. The jury
   selected three winning projects that will be sponsored within the
   highest level of the organization.

   LVMH created DARE in 2017, reflecting a conviction that its own
   employees are an outstanding source of knowledge and creativity to fuel
   innovation and excellence. This initiative gives LVMH employees,
   regardless of their position within the Group, an opportunity to
   express their vision of innovation and transform their ideas into
   concrete projects.

   Under the leadership of Chantal Gaemperle, LVMH Group Executive Vice
   President, Human Resources & Synergies, DARE was developed by the
   members of LVMH House, a mansion in the heart of London’s Mayfair
   district that embodies a label of excellence for talent development for
   senior executives and high potentials. This unique worldwide program is
   cross-brand and cross-sector, encompassing all areas of expertise and
   all generations.

   “The DARE initiative is a cornerstone of our talent development
   strategy, rooted in our core belief that it is our people who make the
   difference. It is an opportunity for our talents from all over the
   world to develop and hone their skillset, to network, and to discover
   and share ideas with the aim of fostering open innovation within the
   group. It promotes a culture of entrepreneurship within the Group that
   is a fundamental value of LVMH,” stated Chantal Gaemperle.

   Since its launch DARE has focused on a variety of topics, from the
   future of luxury and sustainable development to gender equality, with
   events in France, Italy, China and the United States. For the DARE
   event in London, over 13,000 employees from across LVMH based in
   Europe, Middle East and Africa were invited to submit an idea related
   to customer experience innovations.

   The 60 participants selected for DARE London were split into 12 teams
   and joined by students from Central Saint Martins and Imperial College
   London. The teams worked on their projects at LVMH House to turn their
   ideas into business plans, which were then challenged by mentors before
   being pitched to the jury.

   Congratulations to all participants and save the date for the next
   edition of DARE in Tokyo on November 12.

   In 2014 LVMH created the Institut des Métiers d’Excellence (IME), a
   vocational training program that allows the Group to ensure the
   transmission of its unique savoir-faire and promote careers in
   traditional craftsmanship métiers among young generations, at the same
   time developing their employability.

   A groundbreaking initiative in the luxury industry, the Institut des
   Métiers d’Excellence LVMH offers training through partnerships with
   leading schools throughout Europe in key sectors for LVMH (jewelry,
   vineyards and winemaking, couture, retail, design, leather goods,
   watchmaking and culinary arts).

   Student apprentices taking the courses receive both technical training
   and theoretical  education. They alternate between sessions at partner
   schools and practical experience at LVMH Maisons or specialists in a
   given sector, working under paid professional training contracts.

   IME apprentices also take foreign language classes, meet regularly with
   skilled artisans, experts and designers, and visit the workshops and
   stores of LVMH Maisons.

   The IME has trained more than 500 young people since its creation. The
   program had a 96% graduation rate in 2017 and nearly 90% of the
   graduates found jobs after completing the program – two-thirds of them
   with LVMH Maisons. The IME continues to achieve the objectives set when
   the program was launched: develop the employability of youth who are
   either unskilled or seeking to learn new skills, while passing on the
   invaluable savoir-faire of LVMH Maisons to new generations.

   The LVMH Maisons taking part in the IME program are Berluti, Bulgari,
   Céline, Chaumet, Christian Dior Couture, Emilio Pucci, Fendi, Fred,
   Givenchy, Guerlain, Hennessy, Hublot, Kenzo, La Grande Epicerie, Le Bon
   Marché Rive Gauche, Loewe, Loro Piana, Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs, Make
   Up For Ever, Moët & Chandon, Moynat, Parfums Christian Dior, Parfums
   Givenchy, Sephora, TAG Heuer, Veuve Clicquot and Zenith.

   In order to protect and develop our Fashion & Leather Goods Houses'
   access to the raw materials and superior savoir-faire they require,
   LVMH Métiers d'Art provides long-term investment and support for its
   best suppliers.

   With its partner suppliers, LVMH Métiers d’Art implements a
   comprehensive sustainable development strategy: in the sourcing of
   quality, raw materials (often rare or increasingly scarce) and in
   enriching the transmission of savoir-faire (at times traditional,
   unique and specific to our industry).

   Beyond this, and in line with the Group’s values, LVMH Métiers d’Art
   sharpens artisan creativity and innovation in all its forms, through
   shared projects, exchanges between “métiers” and external partnerships.

   In this way, within the leather “métiers”, LVMH Métiers d’Art joined
   forces with the Koh brothers in order to develop the Heng Long tannery
   in Singapore. Founded in 1950, it is now the leader in the tanning of
   crocodile hides. In 2012, LVMH acquired the Roux Tanneries, one of the
   last remaining French tanneries specialized in tanning calf hides,
   founded in 1803.

   In 2015 LVMH acquired a stake in the Spanish tannery Riba-Guixà, a
   leading specialist in Entrefino lambskin processing.

   LVMH has always been devoted to supporting the talent of tomorrow. In
   2014, the Group reaffirmed this commitment with the creation of the
   LVMH Prize for Young Fashion Designers.

   Its concept, content and international scope are unprecedented, and
   each edition of the LVMH Prize recognizes the talent of a particularly
   outstanding designer, selected by a jury of Artistic Directors from our
   Houses.

   “The LVMH Prize aims to support young fashion designers. This
   sponsorship initiative reflects the values of our Group: our designers
   single out the talent of tomorrow, and they are rewarded and supported
   through the development of their House. Our ambition is to nurture the
   vitality and creativity of the fashion world at the international
   level. As a leader in our sector, it is our responsibility to discover
   young talents and help them to develop,” explains Delphine Arnault,
   Executive Vice-President of Louis Vuitton.

   The winner of the LVMH prize will receive a 300,000 euro grant and
   personalized assistance in the development of his or her company from a
   specific team within the Group, over a period of twelve months, as from
   the presentation of the LVMH Prize. This assistance is available from
   all the areas of expertise which may interest a burgeoning fashion
   House (production and distribution, image and communication, marketing,
   intellectual property, and so on).

   LVMH also rewards three young fashion design graduates, offering them
   the chance to spend a year with the creative team at one of the Group’s
   Houses.

   Since its first edition, the LVMH Prize has rewarded several talents:
   Thomas Tait, Miuniki, Hood by Air, Marques’Almeida, Simon Porte
   Jacquemus, Grace Wales Bonner, Vejas Kruszewski, Marine Serre, Kozaburo
   Akasaka, Masayuki Ino, Rok Hwang, …

   For the first time since the creation of this forward-facing
   intrapreneurship program, the LVMH Group organized its DARE (Disrupt
   Act Risk to be an Entrepreneur) event in London. For three days, Group
   employees across the EMEA region – selected from 450 talents
   shortlisted following a call for ideas to  “Shaping the Customer
   Experience of Tomorrow” – joined one another to brainstorm in London.
   The fruit of their reflections was presented to a jury of executives
   from LVMH and its Maisons, along with outside entrepreneurs. The jury
   selected three winning projects that will be sponsored within the
   highest level of the organization.

   LVMH created DARE in 2017, reflecting a conviction that its own
   employees are an outstanding source of knowledge and creativity to fuel
   innovation and excellence. This initiative gives LVMH employees,
   regardless of their position within the Group, an opportunity to
   express their vision of innovation and transform their ideas into
   concrete projects.

   Under the leadership of Chantal Gaemperle, LVMH Group Executive Vice
   President, Human Resources & Synergies, DARE was developed by the
   members of LVMH House, a mansion in the heart of London’s Mayfair
   district that embodies a label of excellence for talent development for
   senior executives and high potentials. This unique worldwide program is
   cross-brand and cross-sector, encompassing all areas of expertise and
   all generations.

   “The DARE initiative is a cornerstone of our talent development
   strategy, rooted in our core belief that it is our people who make the
   difference. It is an opportunity for our talents from all over the
   world to develop and hone their skillset, to network, and to discover
   and share ideas with the aim of fostering open innovation within the
   group. It promotes a culture of entrepreneurship within the Group that
   is a fundamental value of LVMH,” stated Chantal Gaemperle.

   Since its launch DARE has focused on a variety of topics, from the
   future of luxury and sustainable development to gender equality, with
   events in France, Italy, China and the United States. For the DARE
   event in London, over 13,000 employees from across LVMH based in
   Europe, Middle East and Africa were invited to submit an idea related
   to customer experience innovations.

   The 60 participants selected for DARE London were split into 12 teams
   and joined by students from Central Saint Martins and Imperial College
   London. The teams worked on their projects at LVMH House to turn their
   ideas into business plans, which were then challenged by mentors before
   being pitched to the jury.

   Congratulations to all participants and save the date for the next
   edition of DARE in Tokyo on November 12.

   In 2014 LVMH created the Institut des Métiers d’Excellence (IME), a
   vocational training program that allows the Group to ensure the
   transmission of its unique savoir-faire and promote careers in
   traditional craftsmanship métiers among young generations, at the same
   time developing their employability.

   A groundbreaking initiative in the luxury industry, the Institut des
   Métiers d’Excellence LVMH offers training through partnerships with
   leading schools throughout Europe in key sectors for LVMH (jewelry,
   vineyards and winemaking, couture, retail, design, leather goods,
   watchmaking and culinary arts).

   Student apprentices taking the courses receive both technical training
   and theoretical  education. They alternate between sessions at partner
   schools and practical experience at LVMH Maisons or specialists in a
   given sector, working under paid professional training contracts.

   IME apprentices also take foreign language classes, meet regularly with
   skilled artisans, experts and designers, and visit the workshops and
   stores of LVMH Maisons.

   The IME has trained more than 500 young people since its creation. The
   program had a 96% graduation rate in 2017 and nearly 90% of the
   graduates found jobs after completing the program – two-thirds of them
   with LVMH Maisons. The IME continues to achieve the objectives set when
   the program was launched: develop the employability of youth who are
   either unskilled or seeking to learn new skills, while passing on the
   invaluable savoir-faire of LVMH Maisons to new generations.

   The LVMH Maisons taking part in the IME program are Berluti, Bulgari,
   Céline, Chaumet, Christian Dior Couture, Emilio Pucci, Fendi, Fred,
   Givenchy, Guerlain, Hennessy, Hublot, Kenzo, La Grande Epicerie, Le Bon
   Marché Rive Gauche, Loewe, Loro Piana, Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs, Make
   Up For Ever, Moët & Chandon, Moynat, Parfums Christian Dior, Parfums
   Givenchy, Sephora, TAG Heuer, Veuve Clicquot and Zenith.

   In order to protect and develop our Fashion & Leather Goods Houses'
   access to the raw materials and superior savoir-faire they require,
   LVMH Métiers d'Art provides long-term investment and support for its
   best suppliers.

   With its partner suppliers, LVMH Métiers d’Art implements a
   comprehensive sustainable development strategy: in the sourcing of
   quality, raw materials (often rare or increasingly scarce) and in
   enriching the transmission of savoir-faire (at times traditional,
   unique and specific to our industry).

   Beyond this, and in line with the Group’s values, LVMH Métiers d’Art
   sharpens artisan creativity and innovation in all its forms, through
   shared projects, exchanges between “métiers” and external partnerships.

   In this way, within the leather “métiers”, LVMH Métiers d’Art joined
   forces with the Koh brothers in order to develop the Heng Long tannery
   in Singapore. Founded in 1950, it is now the leader in the tanning of
   crocodile hides. In 2012, LVMH acquired the Roux Tanneries, one of the
   last remaining French tanneries specialized in tanning calf hides,
   founded in 1803.

   In 2015 LVMH acquired a stake in the Spanish tannery Riba-Guixà, a
   leading specialist in Entrefino lambskin processing.

   LVMH has always been devoted to supporting the talent of tomorrow. In
   2014, the Group reaffirmed this commitment with the creation of the
   LVMH Prize for Young Fashion Designers.

   Its concept, content and international scope are unprecedented, and
   each edition of the LVMH Prize recognizes the talent of a particularly
   outstanding designer, selected by a jury of Artistic Directors from our
   Houses.

   “The LVMH Prize aims to support young fashion designers. This
   sponsorship initiative reflects the values of our Group: our designers
   single out the talent of tomorrow, and they are rewarded and supported
   through the development of their House. Our ambition is to nurture the
   vitality and creativity of the fashion world at the international
   level. As a leader in our sector, it is our responsibility to discover
   young talents and help them to develop,” explains Delphine Arnault,
   Executive Vice-President of Louis Vuitton.

   The winner of the LVMH prize will receive a 300,000 euro grant and
   personalized assistance in the development of his or her company from a
   specific team within the Group, over a period of twelve months, as from
   the presentation of the LVMH Prize. This assistance is available from
   all the areas of expertise which may interest a burgeoning fashion
   House (production and distribution, image and communication, marketing,
   intellectual property, and so on).

   LVMH also rewards three young fashion design graduates, offering them
   the chance to spend a year with the creative team at one of the Group’s
   Houses.

   Since its first edition, the LVMH Prize has rewarded several talents:
   Thomas Tait, Miuniki, Hood by Air, Marques’Almeida, Simon Porte
   Jacquemus, Grace Wales Bonner, Vejas Kruszewski, Marine Serre, Kozaburo
   Akasaka, Masayuki Ino, Rok Hwang, …
