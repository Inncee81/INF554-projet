Genius and Spotify Together?

   news
   Jan 12, 2016
   by Tom Lehman
   @LEMON

   Now you know you’re in trouble!

   It has always been one of our goals to put Genius at your fingertips
   whenever and wherever you experience music, and today we take a big
   step toward making this vision a reality.

   I’m proud to announce that we’re partnering with Spotify to bring
   Genius to all Spotify users. Check it:

   IFRAME:
   https://www.youtube.com/embed/nbzcUUCfY9Q?modestbranding=1&start=0&show
   info=0&enablejsapi=1&origin=genius.com

   For this integration we stripped Genius down to its essence with a new
   product we call the Fact Track. It’s like a soundtrack… but with more
   facts! Also, it sounds like “FAQ Track,” which makes sense because it
   answers all your FAQs about a song.

   Fact Tracks play along with the music, which limits the amount of
   information we can show, but also allows us to give you the facts
   unfiltered and straight into your soul windows. No tapping, no
   clicking, just LEAN BACK:

   IFRAME:
   https://www.youtube.com/embed/andSducZ6to?modestbranding=1&start=0&show
   info=0&enablejsapi=1&origin=genius.com

   LET ME WATCH! How?!

   Starting today, Genius-powered tracks are live on two brand-new Genius
   x Spotify playlists, Behind the Lyrics: Hip-Hop and Behind the Lyrics:
   Hits. There are also three artist-driven playlists featuring our launch
   artists Pusha T, Tinashe, and Diplo! (Keep your eyes peeled for more
   playlists—a pop one is premiering VERY soon…)

   So: if you have an iPhone (sorry, it’s iPhone-only for now!), go to
   Spotify immediately. Do it! Stop reading!

   I’M STILL READING! Maybe I have an Android or something.

   You’re in luck: you can also watch Fact Tracks on Genius.com on your
   laptop! Just:
    1. Choose a song that has a Fact Track. Here is a list.
    2. Make sure Spotify is open (download it here).
    3. Click the purple button below the song artwork in the right column
       (on mobile, it’s located at the bottom of the page). It looks like
       this:
    4. Enjoy! If you’re on mobile, the button will take you to the Spotify
       playlist and you’ll have to play a song manually.

   Who created these Fact Tracks?

   The Genius community of scholars! Or to be more precise: the knowledge
   in these Fact Tracks comes from Genius.com, but we did some extra work
   to time them to the music (it’s pretty tricky! But also kind of fun!).
   The goal is to crowd-source Fact Tracks, but we couldn’t do it for the
   initial launch.

   So, to the Genius community: stay tuned, we’ll be rolling out updates
   about how everyone can create Fact Tracks soon. And also thank you—this
   collaboration could never happen without you, nor, in fact, could
   Genius itself exist!

   We’ve only just begun…

   — Tom Lehman, Genius co-founder and CEO

About “Getting Involved With Genius Projects”

   Genius has a lot more to offer than just transcribing and annotating
   the newest music releases. There are millions of songs out there that
   still need transcribing, thousands of songs that need updating in
   countless ways.

   To accomplish this, the Genius community has a variety of projects that
   are taking place across all genres and time periods, with a plethora of
   tasks at hand. Here’s a dynamic list featuring all the different
   initiatives springing up within the Genius Community. By clicking on
   the “Info” annotation, you will notice a brief description is provided
   for each project, as well as who is leading the cause.
     *

I want to start a project of my own, how do I go about this?
       That’s great, we are always looking for new projects to add to this
       list. If you’re thinking about starting a project but don’t know
       where to start contact someone on one of these lists and asks for
       some pointers. Some of best places to get started are in the forums
       so slide on over there and see if you can get any interest in the
       project you wish to tackle.
     *

Can I add my project to the list?
       It’s encouraged! But before you do please consider these few
       things. What kind of project is mine? Have I created a forum thread
       about the project? Is there a page that lists the progress of the
       page? If you have any questions feel free to contact me.
     *

Is there a place that has brainstorming for another project?
       Yes there is. Though this isn’t an all ending list this does have
       some ideas from one users perspective. You may also start your own
       project and post it here!
     *

Is there a monthly thread that goes along with this?
       Yes each month a thread is posted in the Music forum highlighting
       new projects, and advancements in current projects. It’s released
       sometime on the first of the month so be sure to keep an eye out
       for it.

About “How Genius Works”

   This guide explains all the details of our collaborative knowledge
   project.

   It’s intended as a manual for new users, and a reference tool for
   scholars looking to better understand all aspects of Genius, including
   our tips on writing good annotations…

   The 10 Annotation Commandments:
   Follow these rules of thumb to avoid having your annotation rejected by
   an editor.
    1. Don’t Restate The Lyric: Most lyrics don’t need to be explained—the
       meaning is obvious. Don’t just paraphrase them using other words!
       Not all lines need to be annotated.
    2. Write Like A Human: An annotation shouldn’t sound like a robot
       wrote it. Avoid overly complicated words, but don’t be too casual
       either.
    3. Watch Grammar & Spelling: Writing like a human doesn’t mean
       forgetting the basic elements of style. Annotations are important,
       so don’t undermine them with sloppy writing.
    4. Do Research & Hyperlink Sources: Avoid plagiarism and speculation
       by searching for original sources and putting the information in
       your own words. Don’t just cite or copy from Wikipedia. Be sure to
       link your sources in the annotation.
    5. Highlight All Relevant Lyrics: Don’t just highlight a single
       word—annotate at least one full line. Sometimes you need two or
       even four bars to get the full context, but be wary of highlighting
       more than four lines for an annotation.
    6. Master Formatting: Familiarize yourself with markdown, the basic
       code used in annotations that allows you to create italics, bold,
       blockquotes, and all the other formatting flourishes that will make
       your ’tates a joy to read.
    7. Include Media That Adds Depth: If you add an image, it should
       really illustrate something specific in the lyric, not just a
       general idea.
    8. Be Objective: Your annotations shouldn’t be rude or demeaning to
       the artist, and you shouldn’t write like a corny superfan.
    9. Be Concise: Here’s a good challenge: say what you mean in the
       fewest words possible. Wordiness ruins good annotations, but don’t
       go overboard—not providing enough information ruins tates, too.
       Annotations should have more than 50 characters.
   10. Be Evergreen Avoid time-sensitive phrasing that will quickly become
       inaccurate (e.g. “two years ago,” “next summer,” “recently,”
       “upcoming,” etc).

How can you edit a song's lyrics?
       Click the “Edit Lyrics” button at the top of the song page. Your
       ability to do so may depend on your IQ and certain specific
       situations.
     *

How do I submit lyrics?
       Once you have over 100 IQ, you can click the “Add A Song” link at
       the top of the page to add lyrics to Genius. Search for the song
       first to make sure it’s not already on Genius! Learn more about
       transcription here.
     *

How do you change your username and password?
       If you are not a moderator or staff member, you can change your
       username by scrolling to the upper-right hand corner of the
       website, clicking your avatar icon and then picking the option
       which says “View Profile.”
       Once on your profile, under your avatar picture, you will see
       various options. Press the option which says “Change name, email
       address or password.” Here you can choose your new username, make
       sure it is not offensive and complies with the Genius community
       policy.
     *

How do you annotate repeated lyrics or separated lyrics with one annotation?
       When you click on an annotation, the URL will change. Copy the
       string of numbers at the end (such as 11315517), then click on the
       “edit lyrics” button and put the text you want to be annotated in
       square brackets ([]) with the number next to the closing square
       bracket in normal brackets (()), as shown below:
       Here it is zoomed in more:
       Note that this can only be done on the same song. An annotation
       cannot be present over multiple tracks.
     *

What is penalty boxing?
       It’s a way to suspend a contributors' activity if he/she has
       committed an offense on the site. For example, purposely
       shitposting, baiting, or trolling, taking part in targeted mass
       downvoting, spamming, or creating alt accounts.
       Please read Genius' Community Policy & Moderation Guidelines for
       more information.
     *

How do you add an album cover to an existing album?
       By clicking “Edit Album Info” on an album page, and then clicking
       “Edit Cover Art.” From there, you can add cover art via URL or from
       a file on your computer.
       If this feature isn’t available to you, it might be because you
       need 300 IQ points. In that case, contact an editor or moderator
       and they will be able to do it for you.
     *

What does it mean if your suggestion gets archived?
       An archived suggestion will no longer appear in the comment
       section, but the data will be available to view in the user’s “All
       Activity” feed.
       A suggestion may be archived by an editor or moderator for any
       number of reasons:
         1. If it does not contain information relevant to the annotation
            in question.
         2. If it mentions something that has already been addressed.
         3. If it contains spam or vulgar language.
     *

Does translating a lyric count as restating it?
       No, “restating the line” is an annotation suggestion feature
       intended to mark a tate as redundant. Translations are lyric pages
       for users who speak a language other than English. Here’s a guide.
       Additionally, lines performed in a different language other than
       English on a primarily-English song are similar. Translations are
       fine on their own, but try to expand upon it more than just the
       translation.
     *

I can't upload my first profile picture, and I need 100 IQ. What should I do?
       Jump on a laptop and try it – it should work! Besides, IQ isn’t
       everything and you can make progress by annotating lyrics!
     *

What can I do if my annotation was rejected, only to be added by another
user?
       If your contribution has been plagiarized directly, you can reach
       out to a Moderator or post in the Help Forum.
       However, oftentimes, annotations lack credible sources, contain
       improper grammar/punctuation, or simply do not meet Genius
       formatting standards. It is perfectly acceptable for an Editor to
       reject this material and then recreate an annotation that does meet
       current standards. It is also common for Editors to accept sub-par
       annotations and revise them afterward, but it is ultimately up to
       that user’s discretion.
       Most Editors and Moderators are open to respectfully discussing the
       reasoning behind their decision in a PM. That is probably the most
       effective route to take if you feel that your annotation was
       wrongly rejected.
     *

How do I add gifs to annotations?
       You can just paste the gif link in the annotation, although be
       forewarned that some gif links are incompatible for one reason or
       another. Usually, the ones that end in “.gif” are the ones that
       actually appear correctly.
       It helps to right-click the gif and press “open image in new tab”
       first, and then check the URL to see if it looks proper. If the
       image still won’t appear, you can copy-&-paste the link into
       imgur.com and use the imgur link instead.
     *

What can I do if no one reviews my annotation?
       You can tag an editor by writing a comment below your annotation
       (e.g. @ Editor username) or by sending a private message, or PM. If
       you don’t know who to ask, you could also check out the editor or
       moderator contact list.
     *

How can I find the 'Edit Lyrics'/'Edit Song Facts' buttons on mobile browser?
       The “Edit Lyrics” and “Edit Song Facts” buttons don’t appear on the
       mobile version of the site.
       In the Google Chrome drop down menu, select “Request Desktop Site”
       to go to the desktop version, where the buttons will appear above
       the lyrics. Click here for a screenshot, and read this annotation
       for more.
     *

How do I create an article in Genius? Do I need a certain level of IQ?
       Community pitching and writing articles for Genius is currently
       limited to editors and moderators. For more on earning those roles,
       check out the What Is an Editor? and What is a Moderator? guides.
       However, submitting annotations to be featured in Genius articles
       is open to everyone—you can post them here.
     *

How do you delete your account?
       There isn’t a way for users to directly delete their accounts, but
       if you’re sure you want it to be erased, you can send an email to
       privacy@genius.com from the email associated with your account, or
       send @Empath a message on the site.
     *

How can I upload my first profile picture
       Go to your profile and you’ll see a button that says Edit right
       under your name, all you do is click on that and you’ll see two
       options, one says Avatar and the other says Cover Art.
       You just click on Avatar first and it’ll pull up a choice of
       options on your left, if you want to upload a picture of your own
       then you click on the My Computer link, if you just want to choose
       a random picture click on the Web Images button and type in
       whatever you want a picture of. You do the exact same thing for
       Cover Art.
     *

Fastest way to get IQ?
       Make annotations, answer questions. Making an unreviewed annotation
       will give you +5 IQ, and having it accepted will give you +10IQ,
       and then answers and annotations can be upvoted. An upvote from a
       contributor will give +4 IQ, and upvote from an editor will give +6
       IQ and an upvote from a moderator or staff member will give +10IQ.

       Annotations should have more than 50 characters.
   10. Be Evergreen Avoid time-sensitive phrasing that will quickly become
       inaccurate (e.g. “two years ago,” “next summer,” “recently,”
       “upcoming,” etc).

How can you edit a song's lyrics?
       Click the “Edit Lyrics” button at the top of the song page. Your
       ability to do so may depend on your IQ and certain specific
       situations.
     *

How do I submit lyrics?
       Once you have over 100 IQ, you can click the “Add A Song” link at
       the top of the page to add lyrics to Genius. Search for the song
       first to make sure it’s not already on Genius! Learn more about
       transcription here.
     *

How do you change your username and password?
       If you are not a moderator or staff member, you can change your
       username by scrolling to the upper-right hand corner of the
       website, clicking your avatar icon and then picking the option
       which says “View Profile.”
       Once on your profile, under your avatar picture, you will see
       various options. Press the option which says “Change name, email
       address or password.” Here you can choose your new username, make
       sure it is not offensive and complies with the Genius community
       policy.
     *

How do you annotate repeated lyrics or separated lyrics with one annotation?
       When you click on an annotation, the URL will change. Copy the
       string of numbers at the end (such as 11315517), then click on the
       “edit lyrics” button and put the text you want to be annotated in
       square brackets ([]) with the number next to the closing square
       bracket in normal brackets (()), as shown below:
       Here it is zoomed in more:
       Note that this can only be done on the same song. An annotation
       cannot be present over multiple tracks.
     *

What is penalty boxing?
       It’s a way to suspend a contributors' activity if he/she has
       committed an offense on the site. For example, purposely
       shitposting, baiting, or trolling, taking part in targeted mass
       downvoting, spamming, or creating alt accounts.
       Please read Genius' Community Policy & Moderation Guidelines for
       more information.
     *

How do you add an album cover to an existing album?
       By clicking “Edit Album Info” on an album page, and then clicking
       “Edit Cover Art.” From there, you can add cover art via URL or from
       a file on your computer.
       If this feature isn’t available to you, it might be because you
       need 300 IQ points. In that case, contact an editor or moderator
       and they will be able to do it for you.
     *

What does it mean if your suggestion gets archived?
       An archived suggestion will no longer appear in the comment
       section, but the data will be available to view in the user’s “All
       Activity” feed.
       A suggestion may be archived by an editor or moderator for any
       number of reasons:
         1. If it does not contain information relevant to the annotation
            in question.
         2. If it mentions something that has already been addressed.
         3. If it contains spam or vulgar language.
     *

Does translating a lyric count as restating it?
       No, “restating the line” is an annotation suggestion feature
       intended to mark a tate as redundant. Translations are lyric pages
       for users who speak a language other than English. Here’s a guide.
       Additionally, lines performed in a different language other than
       English on a primarily-English song are similar. Translations are
       fine on their own, but try to expand upon it more than just the
       translation.
     *

I can't upload my first profile picture, and I need 100 IQ. What should I do?
       Jump on a laptop and try it – it should work! Besides, IQ isn’t
       everything and you can make progress by annotating lyrics!
     *

What can I do if my annotation was rejected, only to be added by another
user?
       If your contribution has been plagiarized directly, you can reach
       out to a Moderator or post in the Help Forum.
       However, oftentimes, annotations lack credible sources, contain
       improper grammar/punctuation, or simply do not meet Genius
       formatting standards. It is perfectly acceptable for an Editor to
       reject this material and then recreate an annotation that does meet
       current standards. It is also common for Editors to accept sub-par
       annotations and revise them afterward, but it is ultimately up to
       that user’s discretion.
       Most Editors and Moderators are open to respectfully discussing the
       reasoning behind their decision in a PM. That is probably the most
       effective route to take if you feel that your annotation was
       wrongly rejected.
     *

How do I add gifs to annotations?
       You can just paste the gif link in the annotation, although be
       forewarned that some gif links are incompatible for one reason or
       another. Usually, the ones that end in “.gif” are the ones that
       actually appear correctly.
       It helps to right-click the gif and press “open image in new tab”
       first, and then check the URL to see if it looks proper. If the
       image still won’t appear, you can copy-&-paste the link into
       imgur.com and use the imgur link instead.
     *

What can I do if no one reviews my annotation?
       You can tag an editor by writing a comment below your annotation
       (e.g. @ Editor username) or by sending a private message, or PM. If
       you don’t know who to ask, you could also check out the editor or
       moderator contact list.
     *

How can I find the 'Edit Lyrics'/'Edit Song Facts' buttons on mobile browser?
       The “Edit Lyrics” and “Edit Song Facts” buttons don’t appear on the
       mobile version of the site.
       In the Google Chrome drop down menu, select “Request Desktop Site”
       to go to the desktop version, where the buttons will appear above
       the lyrics. Click here for a screenshot, and read this annotation
       for more.
     *

How do I create an article in Genius? Do I need a certain level of IQ?
       Community pitching and writing articles for Genius is currently
       limited to editors and moderators. For more on earning those roles,
       check out the What Is an Editor? and What is a Moderator? guides.
       However, submitting annotations to be featured in Genius articles
       is open to everyone—you can post them here.
     *

How do you delete your account?
       There isn’t a way for users to directly delete their accounts, but
       if you’re sure you want it to be erased, you can send an email to
       privacy@genius.com from the email associated with your account, or
       send @Empath a message on the site.
     *

How can I upload my first profile picture
       Go to your profile and you’ll see a button that says Edit right
       under your name, all you do is click on that and you’ll see two
       options, one says Avatar and the other says Cover Art.
       You just click on Avatar first and it’ll pull up a choice of
       options on your left, if you want to upload a picture of your own
       then you click on the My Computer link, if you just want to choose
       a random picture click on the Web Images button and type in
       whatever you want a picture of. You do the exact same thing for
       Cover Art.
     *

Fastest way to get IQ?
       Make annotations, answer questions. Making an unreviewed annotation
       will give you +5 IQ, and having it accepted will give you +10IQ,
       and then answers and annotations can be upvoted. An upvote from a
       contributor will give +4 IQ, and upvote from an editor will give +6
       IQ and an upvote from a moderator or staff member will give +10IQ.
