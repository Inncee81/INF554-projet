Heavy rains in western Japan trigger evacuation orders for around 847,000
residents

   Torrential rain hit southwestern Japan on Wednesday morning, prompting
   local governments to instruct thousands of people to evacuate as rivers
   overflowed and at least three people were left dead in what the weather
   agency called an “unprecedented downpour.”

   In Saga Prefecture, in the Kyushu region, Saga Station was flooded and
   a number of vehicles were seen submerged. Landslides were confirmed in
   the city of Takeo and rivers in Ogi and Imari overflowed, flooding
   nearby farm fields.

   A man was confirmed dead after being found in a minicar that had been
   swept away by floodwaters on a road in Takeo, and a woman was found
   dead in a flooded home in the city. Another man was confirmed dead
   after escaping from his submerged light vehicle during flooding in
   Yame, Fukuoka Prefecture, according to police.

   A woman was feared dead after her light vehicle plunged into a flooded
   ditch in the nearby city of Saga, the police said, where a number of
   vehicles were seen submerged.

   “It usually takes about five minutes to come to the station from my
   home, but (today) it took me an hour as it was difficult to walk in
   water up to my knees,” said Takaaki Matsuo, 56, in the city.

   As of noon, Fukuoka, Saga and Nagasaki prefectures had issued
   evacuation orders to around 847,000 residents. The Meteorological
   Agency issued its maximum level 5 warning for floods and landslides in
   the region. The warning was lifted in the afternoon.

   As landslides occurred and both the Ushizu River in the cities of Ogi
   and Taku and the Matsuura River in Imari burst their banks, Saga Gov.
   Yoshinori Yamaguchi requested the Self-Defense Forces be dispatched to
   provide disaster relief.

   Kyushu Railway Co. canceled some services, mainly in the three
   prefectures that were severely affected.

   “We are seeing unprecedented levels of heavy rains in cities where we
   issued special warnings,” weather agency official Yasushi Kajiwara said
   in a hastily organized news conference Wednesday morning. “It is a
   situation where you should do your best to protect your lives.”

   He also urged those currently facing evacuation advisories to act
   before the warning was upgraded further.

   “Please don’t wait,” he said.

   In the early morning, 110 mm of rain was recorded in the city of Saga
   and 109.5 mm in Shiroishi, Saga Prefecture, in a one-hour period,
   according to the agency.

   For the 24 hours through 6 p.m. Thursday, the agency forecast up to 150
   mm of rain in northern Kyushu and the Tokai area, 120 mm in the Chugoku
   and Hokuriku areas and 100 mm in the Kanto-Koshin area, which includes
   Tokyo as well as Yamagata and Nagano prefectures.

   Footage on local television showed rivers swollen by rainwater and
   parked cars surrounded by muddy brown water rising nearly up to the
   vehicles’ roofs.

   In some parts of the affected areas, small landslides have already been
   reported.

   Authorities regularly urge people to take evacuation orders seriously,
   particularly since disastrous heavy rains last summer in the west
   killed more than 200 people.

   Many of the deaths were blamed on the fact that evacuation orders were
   issued too late and some people failed to follow them. Entire
   neighborhoods were buried beneath landslides or submerged in
   floodwaters during the disasters.

   Major manufacturers with production centers in northern Kyushu
   suspended operations of their factories Wednesday.

   Toyota Motor Co.’s factory in Miyawaka, Fukuoka Prefecture, halted
   production of auto parts for the Lexus luxury brand in the afternoon,
   while Canon Inc. called off the day’s operations at its digital camera
   factory in Nagasaki Prefecture, the two companies said.

   The suspensions were aimed at securing the safety of factory workers,
   according to the firms, who both confirmed that the factories
   themselves had not sustained any damage from the heavy rain.

   Other companies that saw operations affected include electronics giant
   Panasonic Corp. and major tire-maker Bridgestone Corp.

   Logistics in northern Kyushu were also affected. Major shipping firm
   Yamato Transport Co. said deliveries were significantly delayed in
   Fukuoka, Saga and Nagasaki prefectures and part of Oita Prefecture on
   Wednesday. Japan Post also reported delays in deliveries of letter and
   packets.

As population ages, Japan's convenience stores find future in funerals

by Tomohiro Osaki

   Staff Writer

   It might escape the notice of a passerby that Davius Living Yamato, a
   one-story building standing unassumingly on a street in Kanagawa
   Prefecture, is a funeral parlor.

   Little about the exterior of this no-frills facility suggests anything
   funereal inside. In fact, if you mistook it for just another
   convenience store you would be close to the truth.

   Where Davius Living Yamato, run by local funeral firm Kanagawa Cosmos
   Co., stands today, there used to be a struggling Lawson Inc. store.
   When the Lawson closed, the building was renovated to become a small
   funeral home focusing on elderly people who have few neighbors or
   friends left to attend their send-off.

   The life expectancy of both men and women in Japan tops 80, and when an
   individual has lived this long, “it is often the case that they were
   hardly in touch with anyone beyond their own family members when they
   died, so naturally not so many people would attend their funeral,” said
   Hirohiko Ishii, a marketing director of Life & Design Group, which owns
   Kanagawa Cosmos.

   “Amid soaring demand for small-sized funerals in this rapidly aging
   society, a property the size of a convenience store was just what we
   were looking for,” Ishii said.

Changing norms

   Kazokuso (funerals mostly attended by family and relatives) have
   traditionally been common in urban areas, where community networks are
   sometimes so weak neighbors hardly know each other, let alone attend
   each other’s funerals. Ishii says this trend has also spread recently
   to rural areas, where families increasingly ask for smaller ceremonies
   just for themselves, not for the neighbors, colleagues and assorted
   other acquaintances who typically would have attended in times past.

   Despite being a niche business, the remodeling of convenience stores
   into funeral parlors may have a strong future, experts say, given the
   tough business conditions facing convenience store operators.

   Life & Design Group currently runs about 60 funeral homes nationwide,
   including in the Kansai region. Of them, 14 operate from buildings that
   used to be convenience stores.

   Ishii says a whopping 80 percent to 90 percent of its clientele now
   want small kazokuso for their loved ones, instead of what are known as
   ippanso (general funerals) that used to define Japan’s rituals for the
   dead.

   Ippanso ceremonies were grand. An attendance of 100 mourners would be
   typical of a larger ippanso, along with dinner and hanawa, expansive
   displays of costly floral wreaths .

   But with many of the deceased now in their 80s or older, “there is an
   overwhelming trend toward saying goodbye to them with just 20 or 30
   people in attendance,” he said.

   The nearly 200-square-meter Davius Living Yamato building houses a main
   room with seating for 20 to 30 people facing an altar. There is also a
   morgue, and a private room with bathroom for use by the bereaved.

   Demand for modestly sized funerals, Ishii said, is buoyed in part by
   the increasingly widespread phenomenon of “solitary deaths.” In Tokyo’s
   23 wards alone, there were 3,179 confirmed cases of people age 65 or
   older dying alone in their home in 2016, Tokyo Metropolitan Government
   figures show.

   “I don’t think we’ll ever see the need for kazokuso overtaken” by that
   for traditional ippanso, Ishii said.

Struggling industry

   Rocketing demand for family-only funerals comes at a time of slowing
   growth in the convenience store industry, whose traditional business
   model, marked by 24-hour operations and rapid expansion to every street
   corner, is crumbling.

   “What was believed to be a lucrative business model that has long
   sustained the convenience store industry now needs an urgent rethink
   due to a labor crunch and the shrinking population,” Naozumi Nishimura,
   a professor of retailing business studies at Japan University of
   Economics, said. In recent years, Japan has seen a high job
   availability ratio, which stores increasingly seek to mitigate by
   tapping unorthodox labor sources, such as students, to fill shifts.

   Signs of stagnation are evident in the latest targets of convenience
   store giants. This fiscal year, Seven-Eleven Japan Co. and Seven-Eleven
   Okinawa Co. plan to open 900 new branches nationwide, marking the first
   time in nine years that the number of intended new additions will fall
   below 1,000, according to Seven-Eleven Japan’s public relations office.
   Moreover, the figure will be offset by the planned closure of 750
   existing outlets, leaving a net increase of just 150.

   Lawson, meanwhile, won’t see any net increase, with the planned opening
   of 700 outlets set to be canceled out by the same number of closures.

   “This year, we won’t set our sights on increasing the number of
   franchisees but prioritize improving profitability, shutting down and
   replacing outlets that have grown too old or failed to produce
   profits,” Lawson’s communications office said in a statement.

   The predicament of convenience store owners was brought into focus in
   February when a 7-Eleven franchisee in Osaka cut its operations to 19
   hours a day, closing at midnight, as it was struggling to make hires.
   The chain’s headquarters reportedly responded by threatening to
   terminate the contract and fine the owner ¥17 million unless
   around-the-clock operations resumed.

   A slew of calls for a review of the industry followed, and the Ministry
   of Economy, Trade and Industry set up a panel of experts in June to
   examine it and draft suggestions on how to achieve sustainable growth.

New opportunities

   With the convenience store industry at a crossroads, the renovation of
   premises as funeral homes could become a hugely successful business,
   Nishimura said.

   “More and more convenience stores, especially those in rural areas, are
   bound to be driven out of business in the future. When this happens,
   the responsibility falls on the headquarters of each chain to help the
   owners — who have for years devoted themselves to the chain — find new
   jobs, instead of simply ending their contracts and leaving them in the
   lurch,” he said.

   While owners of struggling city convenience stores may easily find a
   new location to restart the business, this is easier said than done for
   those in the countryside. Sometimes owners are simply “abandoned” by
   the headquarters, Nishimura said.

   The funeral business, then, is “something the headquarters can arrange
   for the owners to take up as their next possible occupation as part of
   its effort to help sustain their employment,” he said, as there is
   “tremendous” demand for smaller funerals.”There is of course the
   question of whether the owners will agree to switch to this particular
   line of work, but I think that’s certainly a possibility.”

   Funeral industry insiders say it’s not just the size of convenience
   stores that they find attractive. Naoya Matsumura, an employee at
   funeral parlor operator Tear Co., cites their locations. They tend to
   have parking lots and good access to transportation.

   Moreover, they have proper water systems, such as restrooms, and no
   industrial kitchens that need removing, meaning no complex construction
   work is needed. This allows for a cheaper initial investment than some
   would expect, Matsumura said.

   In November, Tear opened its first funeral parlor in a renovated
   convenience store in Nagoya. Feedback has been mostly positive so far,
   the only minor hitch being that the building’s low ceiling initially
   prevented the company from installing an altar, which was redesigned to
   fit.

   “It is our policy that as long as we can find new suitable properties,
   including closed convenience stores, we will accelerate the opening of
   parlors” for kazokuso funerals, Matsumura said.

   But while the business case is clear, potential operators of funeral
   homes may face opposition from residents.

   Hironori Sugawara, president of Sendai-based funeral parlor operator
   Seigetsuki Co., admits that funeral homes, with their inevitable
   association with death, have long been something of a taboo.

   “Just like you wouldn’t want a garbage disposal site near your home —
   even though it’s an important facility — it’s often the case that talk
   of establishing funeral homes is met with resistance from neighbors
   around the area,” Sugawara said.

   Seigetsuki, too, has altered convenience stores into funeral homes to
   keep up with the rising demand, with its third such facility slated to
   debut in December, he said.

   “What we’ve always been careful about is to ensure our funeral parlors
   do not look like what they are,” he said. They eschew the display of
   hanawa wreaths at the entrance.

   “We don’t want people to feel their lives are surrounded by death.”

To baldly grow: Japan scientists regrow hair at record rate

   Polished pates and thinning thatches may one day be a thing of the past
   thanks to Japanese scientists who have developed a way to grow hair
   follicles at a record rate.

   The study used two kinds of cells placed in silicone containers to
   cultivate “hair follicle germs” — the sources of the tiny organs that
   grow and sustain hair.

   Led by professor Junji Fukuda at Yokohama National University, the team
   managed to cultivate 5,000 within just a few days, enough to replenish
   hair.

   The method is a massive step up from existing laborious techniques that
   can create just 50 or so “germs” at once.

   While human tests might not be in the cards for another five years,
   ultimately researchers believe the technique could be used to generate
   luscious new locks.

   The technology could also help cancer patients and others with medical
   conditions that cause hair loss, said Fukuda, whose research was
   published in the journal Biomaterials.

   “Beauty clinics currently often use hair from the occipital region
   (back of the head) and plant them to frontal areas with hair loss. A
   problem with this is that it doesn’t increase the total volume of
   hair,” Fukuda said.

   Existing medication can slow hair loss, but it does not necessarily
   reverse the problem, he added.

   New treatment using the technique may be available in 10 years, the
   professor said.

   While the study offers hope for the hairless, Fukuda debunked some
   rather optimistic reports suggesting McDonald’s fries could help cure
   baldness.

   The silicone used in his study, dimethylpolysiloxane, is reportedly
   used by the fast food giant in its oil fryers, but consuming the
   substance alone offers no fringe benefits.

   Fukuda said he was baffled by the readers’ misinterpretation of his
   research.

   “I have seen online comments asking, ‘how many fries would I have to
   eat to grow my hair?’ ” he said. “I’d feel bad if people think eating
   something would do that!”

Heavy rains in western Japan trigger evacuation orders for around 847,000
residents

   Torrential rain hit southwestern Japan on Wednesday morning, prompting
   local governments to instruct thousands of people to evacuate as rivers
   overflowed and at least three people were left dead in what the weather
   agency called an “unprecedented downpour.”

   In Saga Prefecture, in the Kyushu region, Saga Station was flooded and
   a number of vehicles were seen submerged. Landslides were confirmed in
   the city of Takeo and rivers in Ogi and Imari overflowed, flooding
   nearby farm fields.

   A man was confirmed dead after being found in a minicar that had been
   swept away by floodwaters on a road in Takeo, and a woman was found
   dead in a flooded home in the city. Another man was confirmed dead
   after escaping from his submerged light vehicle during flooding in
   Yame, Fukuoka Prefecture, according to police.

   A woman was feared dead after her light vehicle plunged into a flooded
   ditch in the nearby city of Saga, the police said, where a number of
   vehicles were seen submerged.

   “It usually takes about five minutes to come to the station from my
   home, but (today) it took me an hour as it was difficult to walk in
   water up to my knees,” said Takaaki Matsuo, 56, in the city.

   As of noon, Fukuoka, Saga and Nagasaki prefectures had issued
   evacuation orders to around 847,000 residents. The Meteorological
   Agency issued its maximum level 5 warning for floods and landslides in
   the region. The warning was lifted in the afternoon.

   As landslides occurred and both the Ushizu River in the cities of Ogi
   and Taku and the Matsuura River in Imari burst their banks, Saga Gov.
   Yoshinori Yamaguchi requested the Self-Defense Forces be dispatched to
   provide disaster relief.

   Kyushu Railway Co. canceled some services, mainly in the three
   prefectures that were severely affected.

   “We are seeing unprecedented levels of heavy rains in cities where we
   issued special warnings,” weather agency official Yasushi Kajiwara said
   in a hastily organized news conference Wednesday morning. “It is a
   situation where you should do your best to protect your lives.”

   He also urged those currently facing evacuation advisories to act
   before the warning was upgraded further.

   “Please don’t wait,” he said.

   In the early morning, 110 mm of rain was recorded in the city of Saga
   and 109.5 mm in Shiroishi, Saga Prefecture, in a one-hour period,
   according to the agency.

   For the 24 hours through 6 p.m. Thursday, the agency forecast up to 150
   mm of rain in northern Kyushu and the Tokai area, 120 mm in the Chugoku
   and Hokuriku areas and 100 mm in the Kanto-Koshin area, which includes
   Tokyo as well as Yamagata and Nagano prefectures.

   Footage on local television showed rivers swollen by rainwater and
   parked cars surrounded by muddy brown water rising nearly up to the
   vehicles’ roofs.

   In some parts of the affected areas, small landslides have already been
   reported.

   Authorities regularly urge people to take evacuation orders seriously,
   particularly since disastrous heavy rains last summer in the west
   killed more than 200 people.

   Many of the deaths were blamed on the fact that evacuation orders were
   issued too late and some people failed to follow them. Entire
   neighborhoods were buried beneath landslides or submerged in
   floodwaters during the disasters.

   Major manufacturers with production centers in northern Kyushu
   suspended operations of their factories Wednesday.

   Toyota Motor Co.’s factory in Miyawaka, Fukuoka Prefecture, halted
   production of auto parts for the Lexus luxury brand in the afternoon,
   while Canon Inc. called off the day’s operations at its digital camera
   factory in Nagasaki Prefecture, the two companies said.

   The suspensions were aimed at securing the safety of factory workers,
   according to the firms, who both confirmed that the factories
   themselves had not sustained any damage from the heavy rain.

   Other companies that saw operations affected include electronics giant
   Panasonic Corp. and major tire-maker Bridgestone Corp.

   Logistics in northern Kyushu were also affected. Major shipping firm
   Yamato Transport Co. said deliveries were significantly delayed in
   Fukuoka, Saga and Nagasaki prefectures and part of Oita Prefecture on
   Wednesday. Japan Post also reported delays in deliveries of letter and
   packets.

   Torrential rain hit southwestern Japan on Wednesday morning, prompting
   local governments to instruct thousands of people to evacuate as rivers
   overflowed and at least three people were left dead in what the weather
   agency called an “unprecedented downpour.”

   In Saga Prefecture, in the Kyushu region, Saga Station was flooded and
   a number of vehicles were seen submerged. Landslides were confirmed in
   the city of Takeo and rivers in Ogi and Imari overflowed, flooding
   nearby farm fields.

   A man was confirmed dead after being found in a minicar that had been
   swept away by floodwaters on a road in Takeo, and a woman was found
   dead in a flooded home in the city. Another man was confirmed dead
   after escaping from his submerged light vehicle during flooding in
   Yame, Fukuoka Prefecture, according to police.

   A woman was feared dead after her light vehicle plunged into a flooded
   ditch in the nearby city of Saga, the police said, where a number of
   vehicles were seen submerged.

   “It usually takes about five minutes to come to the station from my
   home, but (today) it took me an hour as it was difficult to walk in
   water up to my knees,” said Takaaki Matsuo, 56, in the city.

   As of noon, Fukuoka, Saga and Nagasaki prefectures had issued
   evacuation orders to around 847,000 residents. The Meteorological
   Agency issued its maximum level 5 warning for floods and landslides in
   the region. The warning was lifted in the afternoon.

   As landslides occurred and both the Ushizu River in the cities of Ogi
   and Taku and the Matsuura River in Imari burst their banks, Saga Gov.
   Yoshinori Yamaguchi requested the Self-Defense Forces be dispatched to
   provide disaster relief.

   Kyushu Railway Co. canceled some services, mainly in the three
   prefectures that were severely affected.

   “We are seeing unprecedented levels of heavy rains in cities where we
   issued special warnings,” weather agency official Yasushi Kajiwara said
   in a hastily organized news conference Wednesday morning. “It is a
   situation where you should do your best to protect your lives.”

   He also urged those currently facing evacuation advisories to act
   before the warning was upgraded further.

   “Please don’t wait,” he said.

   In the early morning, 110 mm of rain was recorded in the city of Saga
   and 109.5 mm in Shiroishi, Saga Prefecture, in a one-hour period,
   according to the agency.

   For the 24 hours through 6 p.m. Thursday, the agency forecast up to 150
   mm of rain in northern Kyushu and the Tokai area, 120 mm in the Chugoku
   and Hokuriku areas and 100 mm in the Kanto-Koshin area, which includes
   Tokyo as well as Yamagata and Nagano prefectures.

   Footage on local television showed rivers swollen by rainwater and
   parked cars surrounded by muddy brown water rising nearly up to the
   vehicles’ roofs.

   In some parts of the affected areas, small landslides have already been
   reported.

   Authorities regularly urge people to take evacuation orders seriously,
   particularly since disastrous heavy rains last summer in the west
   killed more than 200 people.

   Many of the deaths were blamed on the fact that evacuation orders were
   issued too late and some people failed to follow them. Entire
   neighborhoods were buried beneath landslides or submerged in
   floodwaters during the disasters.

   Major manufacturers with production centers in northern Kyushu
   suspended operations of their factories Wednesday.

   Toyota Motor Co.’s factory in Miyawaka, Fukuoka Prefecture, halted
   production of auto parts for the Lexus luxury brand in the afternoon,
   while Canon Inc. called off the day’s operations at its digital camera
   factory in Nagasaki Prefecture, the two companies said.

   themselves had not sustained any damage from the heavy rain.

   Yamato Transport Co. said deliveries were significantly delayed in
   Fukuoka, Saga and Nagasaki prefectures and part of Oita Prefecture on
   Wednesday. Japan Post also reported delays in deliveries of letter and

As population ages, Japan's convenience stores find future in funerals

by Tomohiro Osaki

   It might escape the notice of a passerby that Davius Living Yamato, a
   one-story building standing unassumingly on a street in Kanagawa
   Prefecture, is a funeral parlor.

   Little about the exterior of this no-frills facility suggests anything
   funereal inside. In fact, if you mistook it for just another
   convenience store you would be close to the truth.

   Where Davius Living Yamato, run by local funeral firm Kanagawa Cosmos
   Co., stands today, there used to be a struggling Lawson Inc. store.
   When the Lawson closed, the building was renovated to become a small
   funeral home focusing on elderly people who have few neighbors or
   friends left to attend their send-off.

   The life expectancy of both men and women in Japan tops 80, and when an
   individual has lived this long, “it is often the case that they were
   hardly in touch with anyone beyond their own family members when they
   died, so naturally not so many people would attend their funeral,” said
   Hirohiko Ishii, a marketing director of Life & Design Group, which owns
   Kanagawa Cosmos.

   “Amid soaring demand for small-sized funerals in this rapidly aging
   society, a property the size of a convenience store was just what we
   were looking for,” Ishii said.

Changing norms

   Kazokuso (funerals mostly attended by family and relatives) have
   traditionally been common in urban areas, where community networks are
   sometimes so weak neighbors hardly know each other, let alone attend
   each other’s funerals. Ishii says this trend has also spread recently
   to rural areas, where families increasingly ask for smaller ceremonies
   just for themselves, not for the neighbors, colleagues and assorted
   other acquaintances who typically would have attended in times past.

   Despite being a niche business, the remodeling of convenience stores
   into funeral parlors may have a strong future, experts say, given the
   tough business conditions facing convenience store operators.

   Life & Design Group currently runs about 60 funeral homes nationwide,
   including in the Kansai region. Of them, 14 operate from buildings that
   used to be convenience stores.

   Ishii says a whopping 80 percent to 90 percent of its clientele now
   want small kazokuso for their loved ones, instead of what are known as
   ippanso (general funerals) that used to define Japan’s rituals for the
   dead.

   Ippanso ceremonies were grand. An attendance of 100 mourners would be
   typical of a larger ippanso, along with dinner and hanawa, expansive
   displays of costly floral wreaths .

   But with many of the deceased now in their 80s or older, “there is an
   overwhelming trend toward saying goodbye to them with just 20 or 30
   people in attendance,” he said.

   The nearly 200-square-meter Davius Living Yamato building houses a main
   room with seating for 20 to 30 people facing an altar. There is also a
   morgue, and a private room with bathroom for use by the bereaved.

   Demand for modestly sized funerals, Ishii said, is buoyed in part by
   the increasingly widespread phenomenon of “solitary deaths.” In Tokyo’s
   23 wards alone, there were 3,179 confirmed cases of people age 65 or
   older dying alone in their home in 2016, Tokyo Metropolitan Government
   figures show.

   “I don’t think we’ll ever see the need for kazokuso overtaken” by that
   for traditional ippanso, Ishii said.

Struggling industry

   Rocketing demand for family-only funerals comes at a time of slowing
   growth in the convenience store industry, whose traditional business
   model, marked by 24-hour operations and rapid expansion to every street
   corner, is crumbling.

   “What was believed to be a lucrative business model that has long
   sustained the convenience store industry now needs an urgent rethink
   due to a labor crunch and the shrinking population,” Naozumi Nishimura,
   a professor of retailing business studies at Japan University of
   Economics, said. In recent years, Japan has seen a high job
   availability ratio, which stores increasingly seek to mitigate by
   tapping unorthodox labor sources, such as students, to fill shifts.

   Signs of stagnation are evident in the latest targets of convenience
   store giants. This fiscal year, Seven-Eleven Japan Co. and Seven-Eleven
   Okinawa Co. plan to open 900 new branches nationwide, marking the first
   time in nine years that the number of intended new additions will fall
   below 1,000, according to Seven-Eleven Japan’s public relations office.
   Moreover, the figure will be offset by the planned closure of 750
   existing outlets, leaving a net increase of just 150.

   Lawson, meanwhile, won’t see any net increase, with the planned opening
   of 700 outlets set to be canceled out by the same number of closures.

   “This year, we won’t set our sights on increasing the number of
   franchisees but prioritize improving profitability, shutting down and
   replacing outlets that have grown too old or failed to produce
   profits,” Lawson’s communications office said in a statement.

   The predicament of convenience store owners was brought into focus in
   February when a 7-Eleven franchisee in Osaka cut its operations to 19
   hours a day, closing at midnight, as it was struggling to make hires.
   The chain’s headquarters reportedly responded by threatening to
   terminate the contract and fine the owner ¥17 million unless
   around-the-clock operations resumed.

   A slew of calls for a review of the industry followed, and the Ministry
   of Economy, Trade and Industry set up a panel of experts in June to
   examine it and draft suggestions on how to achieve sustainable growth.

New opportunities

   With the convenience store industry at a crossroads, the renovation of
   premises as funeral homes could become a hugely successful business,
   Nishimura said.

   “More and more convenience stores, especially those in rural areas, are
   bound to be driven out of business in the future. When this happens,
   the responsibility falls on the headquarters of each chain to help the
   owners — who have for years devoted themselves to the chain — find new
   jobs, instead of simply ending their contracts and leaving them in the
   lurch,” he said.

   While owners of struggling city convenience stores may easily find a
   new location to restart the business, this is easier said than done for
   those in the countryside. Sometimes owners are simply “abandoned” by
   the headquarters, Nishimura said.

   The funeral business, then, is “something the headquarters can arrange
   for the owners to take up as their next possible occupation as part of
   its effort to help sustain their employment,” he said, as there is
   “tremendous” demand for smaller funerals.”There is of course the
   question of whether the owners will agree to switch to this particular
   line of work, but I think that’s certainly a possibility.”

   Funeral industry insiders say it’s not just the size of convenience
   stores that they find attractive. Naoya Matsumura, an employee at
   funeral parlor operator Tear Co., cites their locations. They tend to
   have parking lots and good access to transportation.

   Moreover, they have proper water systems, such as restrooms, and no
   industrial kitchens that need removing, meaning no complex construction
   work is needed. This allows for a cheaper initial investment than some
   would expect, Matsumura said.

   In November, Tear opened its first funeral parlor in a renovated
   convenience store in Nagoya. Feedback has been mostly positive so far,
   the only minor hitch being that the building’s low ceiling initially
   prevented the company from installing an altar, which was redesigned to
   fit.

   “It is our policy that as long as we can find new suitable properties,
   including closed convenience stores, we will accelerate the opening of
   parlors” for kazokuso funerals, Matsumura said.

   But while the business case is clear, potential operators of funeral
   homes may face opposition from residents.

   Hironori Sugawara, president of Sendai-based funeral parlor operator
   Seigetsuki Co., admits that funeral homes, with their inevitable
   association with death, have long been something of a taboo.

   “Just like you wouldn’t want a garbage disposal site near your home —
   even though it’s an important facility — it’s often the case that talk
   of establishing funeral homes is met with resistance from neighbors
   around the area,” Sugawara said.

   Seigetsuki, too, has altered convenience stores into funeral homes to
   keep up with the rising demand, with its third such facility slated to
   debut in December, he said.

   “What we’ve always been careful about is to ensure our funeral parlors
   do not look like what they are,” he said. They eschew the display of
   hanawa wreaths at the entrance.

   “We don’t want people to feel their lives are surrounded by death.”

To baldly grow: Japan scientists regrow hair at record rate

   Polished pates and thinning thatches may one day be a thing of the past
   thanks to Japanese scientists who have developed a way to grow hair
   follicles at a record rate.

   The study used two kinds of cells placed in silicone containers to
   cultivate “hair follicle germs” — the sources of the tiny organs that
   grow and sustain hair.

   Led by professor Junji Fukuda at Yokohama National University, the team
   managed to cultivate 5,000 within just a few days, enough to replenish
   hair.

   The method is a massive step up from existing laborious techniques that
   can create just 50 or so “germs” at once.

   While human tests might not be in the cards for another five years,
   ultimately researchers believe the technique could be used to generate
   luscious new locks.

   The technology could also help cancer patients and others with medical
   conditions that cause hair loss, said Fukuda, whose research was
   published in the journal Biomaterials.

   “Beauty clinics currently often use hair from the occipital region
   (back of the head) and plant them to frontal areas with hair loss. A
   problem with this is that it doesn’t increase the total volume of
   hair,” Fukuda said.

   Existing medication can slow hair loss, but it does not necessarily
   reverse the problem, he added.

   New treatment using the technique may be available in 10 years, the
   professor said.

   While the study offers hope for the hairless, Fukuda debunked some
   rather optimistic reports suggesting McDonald’s fries could help cure
   baldness.

   The silicone used in his study, dimethylpolysiloxane, is reportedly
   used by the fast food giant in its oil fryers, but consuming the
   substance alone offers no fringe benefits.

   Fukuda said he was baffled by the readers’ misinterpretation of his
   research.

   “I have seen online comments asking, ‘how many fries would I have to
   eat to grow my hair?’ ” he said. “I’d feel bad if people think eating
   something would do that!”

Heavy rains in western Japan trigger evacuation orders for around 847,000
residents

   Kyodo, AFP-JIJI

   Torrential rain hit southwestern Japan on Wednesday morning, prompting
   local governments to instruct thousands of people to evacuate as rivers
   overflowed and at least three people were left dead in what the weather
   agency called an “unprecedented downpour.”

   In Saga Prefecture, in the Kyushu region, Saga Station was flooded and
   a number of vehicles were seen submerged. Landslides were confirmed in
   the city of Takeo and rivers in Ogi and Imari overflowed, flooding
   nearby farm fields.

   A man was confirmed dead after being found in a minicar that had been
   swept away by floodwaters on a road in Takeo, and a woman was found
   dead in a flooded home in the city. Another man was confirmed dead
   after escaping from his submerged light vehicle during flooding in
   Yame, Fukuoka Prefecture, according to police.

   A woman was feared dead after her light vehicle plunged into a flooded
   ditch in the nearby city of Saga, the police said, where a number of
   vehicles were seen submerged.

   “It usually takes about five minutes to come to the station from my
   home, but (today) it took me an hour as it was difficult to walk in
   water up to my knees,” said Takaaki Matsuo, 56, in the city.

   As of noon, Fukuoka, Saga and Nagasaki prefectures had issued
   evacuation orders to around 847,000 residents. The Meteorological
   Agency issued its maximum level 5 warning for floods and landslides in
   the region. The warning was lifted in the afternoon.

   As landslides occurred and both the Ushizu River in the cities of Ogi
   and Taku and the Matsuura River in Imari burst their banks, Saga Gov.
   Yoshinori Yamaguchi requested the Self-Defense Forces be dispatched to
   provide disaster relief.

   Kyushu Railway Co. canceled some services, mainly in the three
   prefectures that were severely affected.

   “We are seeing unprecedented levels of heavy rains in cities where we
   issued special warnings,” weather agency official Yasushi Kajiwara said
   in a hastily organized news conference Wednesday morning. “It is a
   situation where you should do your best to protect your lives.”

   He also urged those currently facing evacuation advisories to act
   before the warning was upgraded further.

   “Please don’t wait,” he said.

   In the early morning, 110 mm of rain was recorded in the city of Saga
   and 109.5 mm in Shiroishi, Saga Prefecture, in a one-hour period,
   according to the agency.

   For the 24 hours through 6 p.m. Thursday, the agency forecast up to 150
   mm of rain in northern Kyushu and the Tokai area, 120 mm in the Chugoku
   and Hokuriku areas and 100 mm in the Kanto-Koshin area, which includes
   Tokyo as well as Yamagata and Nagano prefectures.

   Footage on local television showed rivers swollen by rainwater and
   parked cars surrounded by muddy brown water rising nearly up to the
   vehicles’ roofs.

   In some parts of the affected areas, small landslides have already been
   reported.

   Authorities regularly urge people to take evacuation orders seriously,
   particularly since disastrous heavy rains last summer in the west
   killed more than 200 people.

   Many of the deaths were blamed on the fact that evacuation orders were
   issued too late and some people failed to follow them. Entire
   neighborhoods were buried beneath landslides or submerged in
   floodwaters during the disasters.

   Major manufacturers with production centers in northern Kyushu
   suspended operations of their factories Wednesday.

   Toyota Motor Co.’s factory in Miyawaka, Fukuoka Prefecture, halted
   production of auto parts for the Lexus luxury brand in the afternoon,
   while Canon Inc. called off the day’s operations at its digital camera
   factory in Nagasaki Prefecture, the two companies said.

   The suspensions were aimed at securing the safety of factory workers,
   according to the firms, who both confirmed that the factories
   themselves had not sustained any damage from the heavy rain.

   Other companies that saw operations affected include electronics giant
   Panasonic Corp. and major tire-maker Bridgestone Corp.

   Logistics in northern Kyushu were also affected. Major shipping firm
   Yamato Transport Co. said deliveries were significantly delayed in
   Fukuoka, Saga and Nagasaki prefectures and part of Oita Prefecture on
   Wednesday. Japan Post also reported delays in deliveries of letter and
   packets.
