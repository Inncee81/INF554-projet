How to upgrade to Bitdefender 2020

   Bitdefender 2020 ensures the best cyber-security available on the
   market and offers a wealth of features designed to keep your devices
   safe. Our company policy is to offer all our customers free upgrades to
   the latest Bitdefender product available on the market for the
   remaining days of their subscription period. These upgrades are
   rolled-out automatically after the launch. To manually upgrade for free
   to the brand-new Bitdefender 2020 simply download the latest
   installation kit from Bitdefender Central and follow the instructions
   presented in the installer.

   Note! When upgrading to Bitdefender 2020 using the steps below, the
   product settings (including the Firewall rules) from the previous
   version are not saved.


If you are using an older version (e.g. Bitdefender 2019, Bitdefender 2018,
etc.) you can upgrade to Bitdefender 2020 by following these steps

   1. Go to Bitdefender Central and sign in.

   2. On the left-side column, click on My Devices.

   3. In the My Devices screen, click on INSTALL PROTECTION and
   select Protect this device, then select device owner.

   4. Run the downloaded executable file on your system and follow the
   on-screen instructions. This will automatically download Bitdefender
   2020 and uninstall the version installed on your device.

   5. Restart your computer when prompted.

   6. Click INSTALL.

   7. After the installation is complete, click START USING BITDEFENDER.

   8. You can now use your Bitdefender 2020 product.

Troubleshooting VPN connection errors

   There are a few common causes for connection errors, such as error
   1009, encountered by Bitdefender VPN:

   • You are not connected to the Internet and can’t access the Internet
   via Wi-Fi or Ethernet cable. Make sure you have Internet access before
   using Bitdefender VPN.

   • A strictly configured firewall is preventing VPN connectivity (e.g.
   3rd party firewall software, router’s built-in firewall). If you are
   not sure if your router comes with dedicated firewall or how to turn it
   off please refer to its manual, contact the manufacturer or your ISP.

   • Another VPN/Proxy is running when you try to connect. In this case,
   disable the other VPN/Proxy solution.

   • You are trying to connect from a public Wi-Fi such as work, school,
   airport, etc. which may have blocked the ports required by Bitdefender
   VPN. You need to contact the network administrator to try and change
   their firewall settings.


   IMPORTANT! Depending on the device you’re currently using, the
   following ports have to be open:

      • Windows: 1194 UDP

      • Mac: 500 UDP & 4500 UDP


If the steps above don't work, try these troubleshooting procedures

   1. Restart the device, then connect again to Bitdefender VPN.


   2. Connect to a different network (e.g. if you were connected to Wi-Fi,
   try connecting to your Ethernet cable or another Wi-Fi).


   3. Make sure the VPN adapter is enabled.

   • Go to Windows Start menu and type in ncpa.cpL then hit Enter.

   • This will open Network Connections. In this window, right click on
   the adapter AnchorFree TAP-Windows Adapter V9 and choose Enable if it’s
   disabled.

   • Try again to connect to Bitdefender VPN.

   VPN AnchorFree 1


   4. Reinstall Bitdefender VPN

   • Uninstall Bitdefender VPN using the instructions provided here.

   • Reinstall Bitdefender VPN: bring up the Bitdefender interface, then
   access Privacy in the left menu. In the VPN module, click Open VPN.

   VPN troubleshooting 1


   5. Change the DNS:

   • Open Control Panel > Network and Internet > Network and Sharing
   Center > Change adapter settings > double-click your active adapter
   (network) > choose Properties

   or

   • Click the Windows Start menu in the lower left corner > type
   in ncpa.cpL and hit Enter > double-click your active adapter (network)
   > choose Properties

   VPN troubleshooting 2

   • Click on Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP /IPv4) in the connection
   items list, then press Properties

   VPN troubleshooting 3

   • Select Use the following DNS server addresses and enter the following
   addresses:

   Preferred DNS server: 1.1.1.1
   Alternate DNS server: 1.0.0.1

   • Click OK to confirm the change, then restart your PC.

   DNS 1111

   manage the subscriptions you have for all your devices.

   subscription.

   NOTE: In order to proceed, you need to have a Bitdefender Central
   account. To create one, you can access this link.

   You can activate your subscription also by following these steps:

   1. Go to Bitdefender Central.

   2. Click on the My Subscriptions panel, located on the left side of the
   window.

   3. Click the ACTIVATION CODE button, then type the code in the
   corresponding field.

     activate subscription 1

   4. Finally, click on ACTIVATE.

   5. Your subscription is now activated. Close the pop-up window or click
   on PROTECT YOUR FIRST DEVICE to install Bitdefender.

   NOTE: You do NOT have to type this activation code again when
   installing Bitdefender products from this account.
