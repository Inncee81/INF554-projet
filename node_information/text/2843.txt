   We Deserve

   When listing all the ways humanity is going to ruin the future, one
   that doesn’t often come up is the sun being blocked out by a horde of
   drone advertising blimps. But that hasn’t stopped one Swiss firm from
   working hard to make it a reality.

   Skye Aero is a project to build 10-foot helium-filled balloons, with
   small propellers attached to give better control than your average
   blimp. The benefits are a much bigger aircraft—useful when you want to
   advertise to people—and one that won’t crash the second it loses power,
   or bumps into anyone.

   It’s not a totally new design—British band Muse have been using a fleet
   of similar drones on their most recent tour—but Swiss firm Aerotain’s
   design stands out, due to its soul-sucking practicality. The company
   thinks Aerotain will be a perfect, audience-engaging advertising
   platform, which is probably true, but a little too consumerist to get
   excited about.

   Moving away from its role as a replacement for the Goodyear Blimp,
   lighter-than-air drones are an interesting and underutilized concept.
   Provided they’re not filled with hydrogen, they offer increased safety
   for flying over crowds, and a much greater payload than traditional
   quadcopters. Hopefully, someone will find a better application for them
   than giant floating billboards.

   Suit Has Lockheed Martin DNA

   As much as the Olympics are a test of humanity's physical capabilities,
   these days the events are also an opportunity for equipment makers to
   show off their latest technologies designed to enhance an athlete's
   performance. And it's fitting that Under Armour's new speedskating
   suit—which the company claims is the fastest in the world—is called the
   Mach 39, since it was developed with the help of Lockheed Martin.

   As the photo of this ridiculously muscled athlete shows, winning gold
   at the Olympics is still dependent on every competitor's performance.
   But when it comes to speedskating, the US Olympic team will have an
   extra edge with the Mach 39, which underwent 300 hours of wind tunnel
   testing and was analyzed using computational fluid dynamics at Lockheed
   Martin to determine the optimal aerodynamic design.

   Not only will its highly engineered molded shape help skaters slice
   through the air, a repositioned zipper that bypasses the throat will
   make the suit more comfortable to wear. And in addition to
   strategically placed vents that help keep the athlete cool, a material
   the company calls ArmourGlide will help drastically reduce friction in
   the thigh area—which is very important in a competition, even if it
   looks like there's am awkward spotlight pointed at the athletes'
   crotches. [Under Armour]

This Is How to Find the Spiders That Are Staring At You in the Dark

   Illustration for article titled This Is How to Find the Spiders That
   Are Staring At You in the Dark

   Have you ever looked out into your backyard at night and wondered how
   many spiders are lurking out there? If you have a flashlight, you can
   spot them by the creepy green glow of their eyes.

   Most spiders have eight eyes. In some species — mostly those that hunt
   for their prey, like wolf spiders — four of those eyes have a
   iridescent layer behind their retinas, called a tapetum. It’s a common
   structure in the animal world, especially in animals that have evolved
   to hunt or forage at night, like cats, dogs, deer, lemurs, raccoon, and
   even some bird species.

   When light shines into the eye, it reflects off the tapetum and back
   onto the retina. More light hitting the retina means that the animal
   can get the most out of every photon, improving its ability to see in
   the dark. The reflected light also creates what’s called “eyeshine,”
   which is why cats’ eyes seem to glow in the dark.

   It’s also why you can see spiders’ eyes glowing bright green in the
   night, if you know how to look: light reflects off their tapeta, and
   they’re looking in your direction. Enjoy thinking about that.

Follow the Eyeshine

   I caught this one myself.

   The Boy Scouts have taught this trick for years; they call it “spider
   sniffing,” but professional biologists also use it to find and study
   spiders that hunt at night. Here’s how it works:

   Hold a flashlight level with your eyes. You’ll look a little silly
   doing this, but it means the light will reflect from the spiders’ eyes
   at an easier angle for you to spot. Sweep the light across the grass
   about 15 or 20 feet away. If you see a bright point of eerie green
   light, that’s your flashlight beam reflecting off a spider’s eyes. Feel
   free to walk over and check it out; you’ll probably be surprised at how
   bright the eyeshine from even a tiny spider can be.

   Advertisement

   In most of North America, you’ll probably find mostly wolf spiders,
   whose venom isn’t dangerous to humans, but you should still be careful.
   You may also see some red reflections out there in the dark; they’re
   probably June bugs or moths.

Looking at You?

   Are Staring At You in the Dark

   Hi, there! Image: Wikimedia Commons

   Spiders have eight eyes, but they don’t actually see that well. Wolf
   spiders have the second-best vision in the class Arachnida, after
   jumping spiders — but even jumping spiders see only about as well as
   cats. Although cats have excellent night vision, and they’re great at
   seeing even the slightest motion, their vision isn’t actually very
   sharp. The world looks brighter, but blurrier, to a cat or a jumping
   spider.

   The world looks even blurrier to a wolf spider. To find prey and dodge
   predators, they rely more on their ability to sense vibrations. That
   means, of course, that they still know exactly where you are.
   Especially the one on your shoulder.

   Humans live on land, but it’s the watery parts of the planet that
   dictate our fate. The frozen ice at the poles and in high mountains and
   the vast swath of ocean that covers nearly three-quarters of the planet
   mean this place is primarily earth in name only. The ice—dubbed the
   cryosphere by scientists—and the oceans…

   The Apple Watch is hands-down the best smartwatch out there. There, I
   said it. It’s a boring conclusion that is nevertheless the cold, hard
   truth. You can prefer a round face, or a different operating system.
   You can scream about better battery life and third-party watch faces
   until you die, purple-faced from asphyxiation. The Series 5 still
   reigns king. That’s true even if this time around, most of the updates
   are small tweaks rather than game-changers.

   Now that’s out of the way, if you have an Apple Watch already, there’s
   not a huge reason to upgrade unless yours is on the verge of dying. (Or
   if you feel like burning your money in a bonfire.) I say this because
   you can get most of what makes the Series 5 great by downloading
   WatchOS 6. That includes new features like women’s health tracking,
   noise monitoring, the tip calculator, the new on-wrist App Store,
   compass, and some updates to Siri—who despite everything, is still the
   worst of the three major voice assistants.

   The most compelling reason to shell out $400 or more for a Series 5
   would be if you want an always-on display. It’s not a new feature in
   the smartwatch world, nor is it unique to Apple. Plenty of Android
   watches introduced always-on display modes ages ago, and Fitbit just
   did it with the Versa 2. That said, the Series 5's always-on display
   does it better.

   Part of that is the low-temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO)
   screen. In simple terms, the screen can refresh at a rate that varies
   from 1Hz to 60Hz. To ensure that the always-on display doesn’t eat into
   battery life, Apple’s also tweaked its sensors to be more
   power-efficient, and watch faces have a “dimmer” mode when you’re not
   looking directly at the watch. For example, the new Meridian face
   switches from white to black when you’re not looking at it and
   eliminates the animation for the second hand. I should note, however,
   the always-on display watch faces aren’t a monochrome bore like it is
   with the Versa 2. You still get to view complications, and there’s
   still a flash of color depending on the watch face.

   The other part is Apple’s keenly aware that everybody’s a busybody.
   True story, seeing an errant message pop up on an Apple Watch was how a
   friend of mine caught a cheating significant other. While you can still
   get notifications and view complications, Apple also includes a “Hide
   Sensitive Complications” option in the watch’s settings. When your
   wrist is down, it’ll hide notifications you don’t want other people
   possibly seeing out the corner of their eye—things like emails,
   messages, heart rate and calendar events. It’s a small touch for sure,
   but one that might matter depending on your job or situation.
   Each watch face has an “alternate” version for the always-on display.

   If you’re worried the always-on display could muck up a night at the
   movies or your sleep, don’t. Apple told me another change with the
   Series 5 is the ambient light sensor. It too is always on now. Meaning,
   if you’re lying in bed trying to sleep, it can tell the lights are off
   and will dim accordingly. I tried it. It works, and there’s always
   theater mode if you want to play it safe.

   Personally, I found the always-on display to be neat but not necessary
   in my day-to-day. I chalk it up to years of reviewing smartwatches—the
   wrist flick is just second nature now. That said, I can see how this
   might be good for new smartwatch owners accustomed to their analog
   watches. The thing I found it most useful for was running. Not because
   it was great in direct sunlight—it’s not—or for glancing at my stats
   from my peripheral vision. (I don’t know how you run, but it’s awkward
   trying to look at your watch without raising your wrist.) It’s useful
   because the display is already on, meaning there’s no lag when you
   flick your wrist to wake the watch up. The stats just get brighter and
   easier to see. It always takes me out of the zone when I have to whip
   my arm up multiple times to check my pace, so this was a welcome
   change.

   As for battery life, you still have to charge every day, but you don’t
   have to pack a charger in your bag. The always-on display does guzzle
   more battery compared to previous models, but not in a noticeable way.
   On a day where I picked the watch up off the charger at 8 am, walked
   the entirety of the Bronx Zoo, and got home around midnight, the Apple
   Watch still had about 30 percent battery left. Of course, how much you
   get off one charge will depend on how heavily you use LTE, Bluetooth,
   and GPS. For reference, a 30-minute GPS run with the always-on display
   zapped about 20 percent of my battery, but by bedtime, I still had 36
   percent left. I didn’t get anywhere near the 36-ish hours I got with
   the Series 4, but as long as you’re okay charging every night you’ll be
   fine.

   The always-on display doesn’t do well in direct sunlight. But because
   it’s always on, there’s no lag in waking up the watch while you’re
   mid-exercise.

   The other hardware upgrade allows the Apple Watch to make emergency
   calls in other countries. Data will still depend on what deals Apple
   has with international carriers, but the idea is if you have a bad
   fall, the watch can call emergency services for you. You will most
   likely never need this feature, but hey, it’s there.

   Advertisement

   That’s really it. Accuracy-wise, the Series 5 delivered the same
   results as the Series 4 during a 2.44-mile GPS run. That’s to say it
   slightly underreported distance (2.39 miles) compared to my phone’s
   GPS, while heart rate was well within 5 beats per minute of a Polar H10
   chest strap. So again, unless you absolutely must have that LTPO screen
   or fancier titanium or ceramic materials, upgrading isn’t worth it. I
   downloaded WatchOS 6 to my Series 4, and it’s fine. You might
   experience some minor lag with an older model—like the Series 2—but a
   millisecond or two of latency isn’t going to kill you. You also might
   notice worse battery life with certain apps from WatchOS 6, but before
   you run to the Apple Store, do yourself a favor and download the update
   and sit with it for a week. If the performance really is unbearable,
   the Series 5 isn’t going anywhere anytime soon.

   As for WatchOS 6 and iOS 13's health updates, they’re solid but more
   passively iterative than mind-blowing. The on-wrist App Store is long
   overdue, but like all wrist-based stores, limiting. Browsing for apps
   is hard on a small screen, even with a dedicated Featured apps
   section—but that’s not a problem unique to Apple. Downloads are easy,
   but some will require your phone nearby. The Compass app will probably
   appeal to hikers or the perpetually lost, but it’s not the most
   exciting feature to write home about.

   Noise monitoring works, but its utility is more long-term. For
   instance, most people will know when they’re in a loud environment so a
   notification telling you “Hey, you’re in a loud place right now” is
   kind of pointless. While testing, I walked past a blaring ambulance
   that registered 105 decibels on my watch. I knew it was loud and bad
   for my ears, so the accompanying notification was redundant. More
   interesting is going into the Health app to look at your noise exposure
   level over the course of a week or month. A week in New York City, for
   example, netted me an average noise exposure level of about 75 decibels
   for a duration of 76 hours and 48 minutes. This is probably more useful
   for people whose jobs may result in hearing loss, like musicians. For
   me, it’s something I can tuck in my small talk arsenal for the next
   time someone asks me what I do for a living.

   Cycles Tracking, however, is a welcome change. I’ve only spent about a
   week or so with it, but I’m tempted to use it as my main period
   tracking app. It’s got a clean design and logging from my wrist is
   easier than on other smartwatches. It’s also a nice touch that you can
   opt in or out of fertility or sexual activity logging, as well as
   choose how prominently that information is displayed in the Health app
   itself. Both are sensitive bits of information that despite Apple’s
   privacy promises, are things women might want to keep to themselves or
   at least away from nosy subway riders. Apple also gets points for
   including text discouraging users from relying on its fertility window
   predictions for contraception—a low bar, but one that some women’s
   health apps fail to clear. My one quibble is like so many period apps
   out there, there’s no option to log certain contraceptive options, such
   as the NuvaRing or birth control pills.
   Cycles Tracking is one of the easiest apps for logging from your wrist.

   Likewise, the new Health app is a marked improvement. Navigating
   between menus takes some getting used to, but the new Highlights
   section is useful context. It is weirdly motivating to see that say, by
   10:30am, I am 3,000 steps behind my daily average. Or that I’m
   averaging fewer exercise minutes this month than last month (23 minutes
   a day in September, versus 25 minutes a day in August). It’s definitely
   not as advanced as the companion apps for a Polar or Garmin smartwatch,
   but it’s better at tracking your trends over time than Fitbit.

   Small improvements are still improvements. The Series 5 might not
   represent a major shift in the same way the Series 4 did, with its
   bigger screen and ECG capabilities, but it is the more comprehensive
   watch. And given the lack of serious competition, it’s not like Apple
   needs to rush with how many features it adds each year. It’s free to
   coast on incremental improvements for the foreseeable future because
   right now, every other smartwatch maker is still playing catch up in
   quality and breadth of features. Except for battery life. But if all I
   can harp on is battery life—a thing most Apple Watch users seem to be
   ambivalent about anyway—then what is there really to complain about?

Flying Drone Billboards Are the Future We Deserve

   We Deserve

   When listing all the ways humanity is going to ruin the future, one
   that doesn’t often come up is the sun being blocked out by a horde of
   drone advertising blimps. But that hasn’t stopped one Swiss firm from
   working hard to make it a reality.

   Skye Aero is a project to build 10-foot helium-filled balloons, with
   small propellers attached to give better control than your average
   blimp. The benefits are a much bigger aircraft—useful when you want to
   advertise to people—and one that won’t crash the second it loses power,
   or bumps into anyone.

   It’s not a totally new design—British band Muse have been using a fleet
   of similar drones on their most recent tour—but Swiss firm Aerotain’s
   design stands out, due to its soul-sucking practicality. The company
   thinks Aerotain will be a perfect, audience-engaging advertising
   platform, which is probably true, but a little too consumerist to get
   excited about.

   Advertisement

   Moving away from its role as a replacement for the Goodyear Blimp,
   lighter-than-air drones are an interesting and underutilized concept.
   Provided they’re not filled with hydrogen, they offer increased safety
   for flying over crowds, and a much greater payload than traditional
   quadcopters. Hopefully, someone will find a better application for them
   than giant floating billboards.

   As much as the Olympics are a test of humanity's physical capabilities,
   these days the events are also an opportunity for equipment makers to
   show off their latest technologies designed to enhance an athlete's
   performance. And it's fitting that Under Armour's new speedskating
   suit—which the company claims is the fastest in the world—is called the
   Mach 39, since it was developed with the help of Lockheed Martin.

   As the photo of this ridiculously muscled athlete shows, winning gold
   at the Olympics is still dependent on every competitor's performance.
   But when it comes to speedskating, the US Olympic team will have an
   extra edge with the Mach 39, which underwent 300 hours of wind tunnel
   testing and was analyzed using computational fluid dynamics at Lockheed
   Martin to determine the optimal aerodynamic design.

   Not only will its highly engineered molded shape help skaters slice
   through the air, a repositioned zipper that bypasses the throat will
   make the suit more comfortable to wear. And in addition to
   strategically placed vents that help keep the athlete cool, a material
   the company calls ArmourGlide will help drastically reduce friction in
   the thigh area—which is very important in a competition, even if it
   looks like there's am awkward spotlight pointed at the athletes'
   crotches. [Under Armour]

   Illustration for article titled This Is How to Find the Spiders That
   Are Staring At You in the Dark

   Have you ever looked out into your backyard at night and wondered how
   many spiders are lurking out there? If you have a flashlight, you can
   spot them by the creepy green glow of their eyes.

   Most spiders have eight eyes. In some species — mostly those that hunt
   for their prey, like wolf spiders — four of those eyes have a
   iridescent layer behind their retinas, called a tapetum. It’s a common
   structure in the animal world, especially in animals that have evolved
   to hunt or forage at night, like cats, dogs, deer, lemurs, raccoon, and
   even some bird species.

   When light shines into the eye, it reflects off the tapetum and back
   onto the retina. More light hitting the retina means that the animal
   can get the most out of every photon, improving its ability to see in
   the dark. The reflected light also creates what’s called “eyeshine,”
   which is why cats’ eyes seem to glow in the dark.

   It’s also why you can see spiders’ eyes glowing bright green in the
   night, if you know how to look: light reflects off their tapeta, and
   they’re looking in your direction. Enjoy thinking about that.

Follow the Eyeshine

   I caught this one myself.

   The Boy Scouts have taught this trick for years; they call it “spider
   sniffing,” but professional biologists also use it to find and study
   spiders that hunt at night. Here’s how it works:

   Hold a flashlight level with your eyes. You’ll look a little silly
   doing this, but it means the light will reflect from the spiders’ eyes
   at an easier angle for you to spot. Sweep the light across the grass
   about 15 or 20 feet away. If you see a bright point of eerie green
   light, that’s your flashlight beam reflecting off a spider’s eyes. Feel
   free to walk over and check it out; you’ll probably be surprised at how
   bright the eyeshine from even a tiny spider can be.

   In most of North America, you’ll probably find mostly wolf spiders,
   whose venom isn’t dangerous to humans, but you should still be careful.
   You may also see some red reflections out there in the dark; they’re
   probably June bugs or moths.

Looking at You?

   Hi, there! Image: Wikimedia Commons

   Spiders have eight eyes, but they don’t actually see that well. Wolf
   spiders have the second-best vision in the class Arachnida, after
   jumping spiders — but even jumping spiders see only about as well as
   cats. Although cats have excellent night vision, and they’re great at
   seeing even the slightest motion, their vision isn’t actually very
   sharp. The world looks brighter, but blurrier, to a cat or a jumping
   spider.

   The world looks even blurrier to a wolf spider. To find prey and dodge
   predators, they rely more on their ability to sense vibrations. That
   means, of course, that they still know exactly where you are.
   Especially the one on your shoulder.

   The Apple Watch is hands-down the best smartwatch out there. There, I
   said it. It’s a boring conclusion that is nevertheless the cold, hard
   truth. You can prefer a round face, or a different operating system.
   You can scream about better battery life and third-party watch faces
   until you die, purple-faced from asphyxiation. The Series 5 still
   reigns king. That’s true even if this time around, most of the updates
   are small tweaks rather than game-changers.

   Advertisement

   Now that’s out of the way, if you have an Apple Watch already, there’s
   not a huge reason to upgrade unless yours is on the verge of dying. (Or
   if you feel like burning your money in a bonfire.) I say this because
   you can get most of what makes the Series 5 great by downloading
   WatchOS 6. That includes new features like women’s health tracking,
   noise monitoring, the tip calculator, the new on-wrist App Store,
   compass, and some updates to Siri—who despite everything, is still the
   worst of the three major voice assistants.

   The most compelling reason to shell out $400 or more for a Series 5
   would be if you want an always-on display. It’s not a new feature in
   the smartwatch world, nor is it unique to Apple. Plenty of Android
   watches introduced always-on display modes ages ago, and Fitbit just
   did it with the Versa 2. That said, the Series 5's always-on display
   does it better.

   Part of that is the low-temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO)
   screen. In simple terms, the screen can refresh at a rate that varies
   from 1Hz to 60Hz. To ensure that the always-on display doesn’t eat into
   battery life, Apple’s also tweaked its sensors to be more
   power-efficient, and watch faces have a “dimmer” mode when you’re not
   looking directly at the watch. For example, the new Meridian face
   switches from white to black when you’re not looking at it and
   eliminates the animation for the second hand. I should note, however,
   the always-on display watch faces aren’t a monochrome bore like it is
   with the Versa 2. You still get to view complications, and there’s
   still a flash of color depending on the watch face.

   The other part is Apple’s keenly aware that everybody’s a busybody.
   True story, seeing an errant message pop up on an Apple Watch was how a
   friend of mine caught a cheating significant other. While you can still
   get notifications and view complications, Apple also includes a “Hide
   Sensitive Complications” option in the watch’s settings. When your
   wrist is down, it’ll hide notifications you don’t want other people
   possibly seeing out the corner of their eye—things like emails,
   messages, heart rate and calendar events. It’s a small touch for sure,
   but one that might matter depending on your job or situation.

   If you’re worried the always-on display could muck up a night at the
   movies or your sleep, don’t. Apple told me another change with the
   Series 5 is the ambient light sensor. It too is always on now. Meaning,
   if you’re lying in bed trying to sleep, it can tell the lights are off
   and will dim accordingly. I tried it. It works, and there’s always
   theater mode if you want to play it safe.

   Personally, I found the always-on display to be neat but not necessary
   in my day-to-day. I chalk it up to years of reviewing smartwatches—the
   wrist flick is just second nature now. That said, I can see how this
   might be good for new smartwatch owners accustomed to their analog
   watches. The thing I found it most useful for was running. Not because
   it was great in direct sunlight—it’s not—or for glancing at my stats
   from my peripheral vision. (I don’t know how you run, but it’s awkward
   trying to look at your watch without raising your wrist.) It’s useful
   because the display is already on, meaning there’s no lag when you
   flick your wrist to wake the watch up. The stats just get brighter and
   easier to see. It always takes me out of the zone when I have to whip
   my arm up multiple times to check my pace, so this was a welcome
   change.

   As for battery life, you still have to charge every day, but you don’t
   have to pack a charger in your bag. The always-on display does guzzle
   more battery compared to previous models, but not in a noticeable way.
   On a day where I picked the watch up off the charger at 8 am, walked
   the entirety of the Bronx Zoo, and got home around midnight, the Apple
   Watch still had about 30 percent battery left. Of course, how much you
   get off one charge will depend on how heavily you use LTE, Bluetooth,
   and GPS. For reference, a 30-minute GPS run with the always-on display
   zapped about 20 percent of my battery, but by bedtime, I still had 36
   percent left. I didn’t get anywhere near the 36-ish hours I got with
   the Series 4, but as long as you’re okay charging every night you’ll be
   fine.

   The always-on display doesn’t do well in direct sunlight. But because
   it’s always on, there’s no lag in waking up the watch while you’re
   mid-exercise.

   The other hardware upgrade allows the Apple Watch to make emergency
   calls in other countries. Data will still depend on what deals Apple
   has with international carriers, but the idea is if you have a bad
   fall, the watch can call emergency services for you. You will most
   likely never need this feature, but hey, it’s there.

   That’s really it. Accuracy-wise, the Series 5 delivered the same
   results as the Series 4 during a 2.44-mile GPS run. That’s to say it
   slightly underreported distance (2.39 miles) compared to my phone’s
   GPS, while heart rate was well within 5 beats per minute of a Polar H10
   chest strap. So again, unless you absolutely must have that LTPO screen
   or fancier titanium or ceramic materials, upgrading isn’t worth it. I
   downloaded WatchOS 6 to my Series 4, and it’s fine. You might
   experience some minor lag with an older model—like the Series 2—but a
   millisecond or two of latency isn’t going to kill you. You also might
   notice worse battery life with certain apps from WatchOS 6, but before
   you run to the Apple Store, do yourself a favor and download the update
   and sit with it for a week. If the performance really is unbearable,
   the Series 5 isn’t going anywhere anytime soon.

   As for WatchOS 6 and iOS 13's health updates, they’re solid but more
   passively iterative than mind-blowing. The on-wrist App Store is long
   overdue, but like all wrist-based stores, limiting. Browsing for apps
   is hard on a small screen, even with a dedicated Featured apps
   section—but that’s not a problem unique to Apple. Downloads are easy,
   but some will require your phone nearby. The Compass app will probably
   appeal to hikers or the perpetually lost, but it’s not the most
   exciting feature to write home about.

   Noise monitoring works, but its utility is more long-term. For
   instance, most people will know when they’re in a loud environment so a
   notification telling you “Hey, you’re in a loud place right now” is
   kind of pointless. While testing, I walked past a blaring ambulance
   that registered 105 decibels on my watch. I knew it was loud and bad
   for my ears, so the accompanying notification was redundant. More
   interesting is going into the Health app to look at your noise exposure
   level over the course of a week or month. A week in New York City, for
   example, netted me an average noise exposure level of about 75 decibels
   for a duration of 76 hours and 48 minutes. This is probably more useful
   for people whose jobs may result in hearing loss, like musicians. For
   me, it’s something I can tuck in my small talk arsenal for the next
   time someone asks me what I do for a living.

   Cycles Tracking, however, is a welcome change. I’ve only spent about a
   week or so with it, but I’m tempted to use it as my main period
   tracking app. It’s got a clean design and logging from my wrist is
   easier than on other smartwatches. It’s also a nice touch that you can
   opt in or out of fertility or sexual activity logging, as well as
   choose how prominently that information is displayed in the Health app
   itself. Both are sensitive bits of information that despite Apple’s
   privacy promises, are things women might want to keep to themselves or
   at least away from nosy subway riders. Apple also gets points for
   including text discouraging users from relying on its fertility window
   predictions for contraception—a low bar, but one that some women’s
   health apps fail to clear. My one quibble is like so many period apps
   out there, there’s no option to log certain contraceptive options, such
   as the NuvaRing or birth control pills.
   Cycles Tracking is one of the easiest apps for logging from your wrist.

   Likewise, the new Health app is a marked improvement. Navigating
   between menus takes some getting used to, but the new Highlights
   section is useful context. It is weirdly motivating to see that say, by
   10:30am, I am 3,000 steps behind my daily average. Or that I’m
   averaging fewer exercise minutes this month than last month (23 minutes
   a day in September, versus 25 minutes a day in August). It’s definitely
   not as advanced as the companion apps for a Polar or Garmin smartwatch,
   but it’s better at tracking your trends over time than Fitbit.

   Small improvements are still improvements. The Series 5 might not
   represent a major shift in the same way the Series 4 did, with its
   bigger screen and ECG capabilities, but it is the more comprehensive
   watch. And given the lack of serious competition, it’s not like Apple
   needs to rush with how many features it adds each year. It’s free to
   coast on incremental improvements for the foreseeable future because
   right now, every other smartwatch maker is still playing catch up in
   quality and breadth of features. Except for battery life. But if all I
   can harp on is battery life—a thing most Apple Watch users seem to be
   ambivalent about anyway—then what is there really to complain about?

     * Main hardware updates are the LTPO screen, which enables its
       always-on display, and emergency cellular calling worldwide.
     * iOS 13 and WatchOS 6 improve health tracking. iOS 13 gives you a
       revamped Health app, while WatchOS 6 adds noise monitoring, women’s
       health, tip calculator, a compass, and on-wrist App Store.
     * Battery life, even with the always-on display, should last you
       through the day but expect to charge every night.
     * It’s the best smartwatch fam, but you don’t need to upgrade if you
       have the Series 3 or 4. If you have an older model, download
       WatchOS 6 first before you decide to shell out.
