Kristen Stewart is looking ahead

   After being catapulted into global stardom as a teenager in The
   Twilight Saga, Kristen Stewart moved on to more challenging roles,
   winning acclaim for her performances in thought-provoking independent
   films. Now, as she returns to the mainstream with Charlie’s Angels, she
   opens up about her fluid sexuality, directorial debut and finding the
   freedom to be herself.

   In a vast downstairs ballroom in the Shangri-La Hotel in Paris, I can
   hear Kristen Stewart before I see her, changing behind a patterned
   screen in a far corner. Her voice is distinctive – that easy,
   low-rolling Californian accent, where all the words run together, and
   she sounds like nothing could surprise her.

   When she finally emerges to go and have her picture taken on a balcony
   with the Eiffel Tower rising up behind her, she is in perfect contrast
   to her delicate, gilded surroundings. Her hair is a black-blonde swipe
   across her forehead, and she’s wearing floor-length black velvet, a
   black bow at her throat, as befits her status as a Chanel ambassador.
   She walks past, a bold, swaggering walk, and smiles. "Yeah," she says,
   seeing my face. "It’s intense. It’s a lot of look."

   Soon enough, she’s back, and changed. Ripped jeans, white T-shirt, bare
   feet: her more natural state. We talk on a warm terrace, cross-legged
   on sofas. I don’t know why I expected her to be reticent or shy, but
   probably because that is how she is always assumed to be, or how she
   comes across in photographs, when her expression sometimes seems
   deadpan, reluctant to give anything away. Or perhaps it’s just how we
   all remember her from the Twilight years as the permanently tortured,
   lovesick Bella Swan. "I try to avoid the word 'awkward'," Stewart says,
   remembering that time. "I want to reclaim that word, because it’s been
   used too violently against me."

   Today, Stewart is anything but awkward. She is relaxed, open, garrulous
   and expressive, arms gesticulating as she talks, her voice clear and
   confident. Take, for example, how she describes meeting Elizabeth Banks
   for the first time (Banks has directed Charlie’s Angels, which comes
   out in November, featuring Stewart as one of the leads). The pair
   happened to be at the same party at the Venice Film Festival a few
   years ago. Stewart was dancing, but a little self-conscious. "I just
   didn’t feel as solid as I do now," she says. Banks, by contrast, was
   having a ball. She came up to Stewart, told her she was a fan and asked
   if she was having a good time. "And then she said what would be the
   most annoying thing to hear from anyone else," says Stewart, "which
   was, 'You’ve got to have fun with it.'" She grins at the memory. "I was
   like, 'No shit! I’m trying.'"

   This is how Stewart talks – frank, candid, plenty of swearing. She
   seems both sure and totally unafraid of saying what she thinks. It’s as
   though something has fallen away: caution, certainly, but also a former
   antipathy towards the whole publicity game that has haunted her on a
   global scale ever since the extraordinary success of Twilight. "Every
   day I get older, life gets easier," she says, smiling broadly.

   Kristen Stewart on how Hollywood is failing women

   Stewart was only 18 when the first Twilight movie came out. As the
   child of a script supervisor (her mother) and a stage manager (her
   father), she’d spent time on sets growing up, and had been acting in
   films since she was 10 years old (her first was The Safety of Objects,
   quickly followed by Panic Room with Jodie Foster). But it was the
   Twilight franchise that made her internationally beloved. She and her
   co-star and then-boyfriend Robert Pattinson would sit in press
   conferences with an expression of traumatised horror on their faces.
   They refused to discuss their relationship, and in interviews there was
   often a sense of a wall going up, of shutters closing. Most of the
   time, Stewart looked like she wanted to run away.

   "When me and Rob were together, we did not have an example to go by,"
   she recalls. "So much was taken from us that, in trying to control one
   aspect, we were just like, 'No, we will never talk about it. Never.
   Because it’s ours.'"
   image
   Alexi Lubomirski

   After the final Twilight film was released, Stewart’s departure from
   the mainstream was pronounced. She acted with Juliette Binoche in
   Clouds of Sils Maria, a role for which she was the first American
   actress to win a César award. Her choices were varied and unexpected:
   she played a psychic in Personal Shopper and made a movie about falling
   in love in an emotionless society (Equals). Her career became, as she
   describes it, "the most random game of hopscotch". She chose to work
   with friends instead of big names and didn’t mind making what she calls
   "weird, risky mistakes".

   But now, in another twist, there’s Charlie’s Angels, her most
   mainstream movie for years. The internet lost its collective mind when
   the trailer came out – Kristen Stewart, the ultimate cool girl, doing
   stunts, doing comedy. "I did Charlie’s [Angels] because I’m a huge fan
   of Liz Banks and I always felt she vouched for me," she explains. "I
   always felt, like, she doesn’t think I’m a freak." It was still an act
   of friendship, but one that allowed Stewart to show off her
   little-known goof ball side and exceptional fighting skills. When her
   friends watched the trailer, they told her: 'Dude, that’s you.
   Finally!'"

     "I never valued the fame thing as much as I valued the experiences I
     got to do while working"

   If the idea of Stewart as goofball seems unlikely, then be reassured:
   she can still be intense. Looking back on those early years, and the
   strange sensation of being an object of fascination in your teens,
   makes her reflective. There were plenty of aspects of her fame that she
   found daunting, but what confused her was the sense that her public
   felt they both knew her and owned her, and then were let down when she
   wasn’t who they presumed she was.

   It was as though she’d become a character, I suggest. "Totally," says
   Stewart."I’ve tried to say this before, and I don’t think I’ve ever
   articulated it properly... but people get mad at you because you’re in
   such a grand position, so if you don’t hold that up, you don’t deserve
   it. I never valued the fame thing as much as I valued the experiences I
   got to do while working, and it perplexed me so much... Some people
   were like, 'You ungrateful asshole!' and I was like, ' Yeah,
   completely, I don’t want to be famous, I want to do my work!'"

   An ode to Kristen Stewart

   These days, Stewart has mellowed. She knows there will always be
   expectations, but she also knows that she doesn’t have to meet them.
   When she looks around at younger actors and how they handle their
   position – the Instagram activism, the campaigning zeal, the ability to
   communicate directly and honestly with their fans – she’s amazed. "They
   have this insane agency," she says. "And the confidence! That is
   baffling! I’m like, how are you so confident? You’re so young!"
   Sometimes, she’s sceptical: the virtue-signalling can be a little
   forced, a little on point. She names no names, obviously, but
   describes, tantalisingly, "a couple of people who are like real
   activists, really at the forefront of progress, and I’m like, 'You are
   a deplorable fraud! And all you really care about is people looking at
   you.'" As I said, she’s unafraid.

   But she’s grateful, too. It is partly thanks to the next generation,
   their openness and bravery, that she has found her voice, and no longer
   seems to care about the consequences of using it. "I used to sit in
   interviews and go, 'God, I wonder what they’re going to ask me,' but
   now – literally – you can ask me anything!" So I take her at her word,
   and enquire what it feels like to constantly discuss her sexuality, now
   that it seemed to have become a subject for open debate.

   "Well," she says, "I think I just wanted to enjoy my life. And that
   took precedence over protecting my life, because in protecting it, I
   was ruining it." In what way, I ask. "Like what, you can’t go outside
   with who you’re with? You can’t talk about it in an interview? I was
   informed by an old school mentality, which is – you want to preserve
   your career and your success and your productivity, and there are
   people in the world who don’t like you, and they don’t like that you
   date girls, and they don’t like that you don’t identify as a quote
   unquote “lesbian”, but you also don’t identify as a quote unquote
   “heterosexual”. And people like to know stuff, so what the fuck are
   you?’

   Stewart’s realisation, which she credits the younger generation with
   giving her the confidence to stick to, was that she was not required to
   answer that question. She has no answer. She doesn’t identify as
   bisexual, she doesn’t identify as a lesbian, she doesn’t like labels.
   She’s a different person every day she wakes up and delighted by that.
   "I just think we’re all kind of getting to a place where – I don’t
   know, evolution’s a weird thing – we’re all becoming incredibly
   ambiguous," she explains. "And it’s this really gorgeous thing."

     "If you don’t go out holding your girlfriend’s hand in public, you
     might get a Marvel movie"

   She accepts that she has become a sort of standard-bearer for that
   ambiguity. But she doesn’t mind. If she can make the conversation about
   sexuality easier for anyone, she’s happy. She also couldn’t care less
   about the impact any of this might have on her career. In the past, she
   says, "I have fully been told, 'If you just like do yourself a favour,
   and don’t go out holding your girlfriend’s hand in public, you might
   get a Marvel movie.'" She looks almost amused at the memory. "I don’t
   want to work with people like that." Now, by contrast, people approach
   her, drawn to that undefined sexuality, wanting to make movies about
   it. Stewart shakes her head in mock despair. "Literally, life is a huge
   popularity contest."

   For the next couple of years – whoever she happens to be dating–
   Stewart will be busier than ever. Back when she was a kid, on set with
   her parents, she told her mother she was going to be the youngest
   person ever to direct a feature film, and that she’d do it before she
   was 18. "Thankfully I did not do that," she says now. But it’s finally
   happening next year, as she approaches her 30th birthday. Just 40 pages
   into reading the memoir, The Chronology of Water, about a young swimmer
   dealing with addiction, she sent an email to its author Lidia
   Yuknavitch. "I was like, I will read your book until the day I die."
   recalls Stewart. She bought the rights, and has spent years writing the
   script, which she recently read aloud to Yuknavitch. "It was a really,
   really satisfying feast of an intimidating experience" says Stewart. "I
   like being intimidated, so that’s fine."

   The script isn’t finished – she wants to keep it fluid, open to
   interpretation. She has a sense of how she wants to do it, but also
   understands what a responsibility it is, being in charge of a cast and
   crew. "I know how precious it is –I’ve done it," she says. "I can’t
   wait to make sure that I don’t mess up anyone’s chance to be great."

   She can’t believe her luck: that she gets to spend hours, years,
   thinking and talking about her favourite book to make it into something
   new. And this is just the beginning, she hopes: there are half a dozen
   other projects she’s keen to make. In the meantime, she’s not going to
   stop acting. If anything, directing is just a natural extension of the
   process – one that she hopes will make her a better actor. But there’s
   also an attraction, inevitably, for someone who has been the subject of
   a collective gaze for so long, in switching positions, going behind the
   camera. In her new state, feeling free and compulsively honest, perhaps
   it’s a more natural place to be.

   As she puts it, just before she pads back to the ballroom on her bare
   feet: "The thing that’s really igniting me is the idea of starting the
   ball rolling – and not being the ball."

Grace Kelly's grandson Louis Ducruet married in Monaco this weekend

   And the bride wore three striking wedding looks

   Louis Ducruet, the grandson of Grace Kelly and Rainer III, Prince of
   Monaco, and the son of Princess Stéphanie of Monaco and Daniel Ducruet,
   married his longtime love, Marie Chevallier this weekend. The couple
   tied the knot during an extravagant two-day ceremony in Monaco.

   Ducruet and Chevallier's civil ceremony took place on Friday, followed
   by a relaxed reception. On Saturday, they had their traditional
   Catholic church ceremony and then hosted a party that evening.

   Naturally, the extensive celebrations required more than one bridal
   ensemble. In fact, Chevallier chose three very different looks for the
   special occasions.

   For the civil ceremony, Chevallier wore a white wide-legged jumpsuit by
   designer Rosa Clará, who shared pictures of the bride and the sketch on
   Instagram. The design was a silk crepe culotte jumpsuit with
   embroidered lace detail at the waist.

   in Monaco. She chose a sophisticated, weightless silk crepe culotte
   jumpsuit with embroidered lace at the waist. The sleeveless design

   love, Louis Ducruet! We can’t feel any prouder of taking part in this

   Her second look was for the church wedding, for which she opted for
   something far more traditional. The bride turned to Atelier Boisanger
   for an intricate gown that took over 300 hours to create.

   Finally, the bride's most low-key look came on Saturday evening, when
   she wore a mullet-hemmed lace dress, also by Rosa Clará.

Downton Abbey's Allen Leech marries Jessica Blair Herman

   The two got married in California earlier this month
   Jan 14, 2019

   EXCLUSIVE: Allen Leech shares his wedding to Jessica Blair Herman with
   HELLO! ♥️ Read about the star-studded ceremony via the link in our bio
   and make sure you pick up the magazine tomorrow to see inside their
   special day 💕💍 📸: @corbingurkin

   A post shared by HELLO! Magazine (@hellomag) on Jan 13, 2019 at 12:33pm
   PST

   Allen Leech married Jessica Blair Herman in California on 5 January and
   has shared pictures for the first time. The Downton Abbey actor married
   actress Jessica Blair Herman on an estate in Santa Barbara with guests
   including Michelle Dockery, Dan Stevens and Rami Malek, who Leech acted
   alongside in Bohemian Rhapsody.

   When heavy rain prevented the string quartet from playing, former Glee
   stars Darren Criss and Lea Michele - who attended the wedding as guests
   - stepped in to sing.

   "Everyone rallied round, the weather only made the day more epic,"
   Allen told Hello! "Darren and Lea are such great people and great
   friends, and they said, 'Absolutely no problem' when we told them the
   situation. We grabbed a guitar and they ended up singing the music for
   our ceremony."

   The bride wore a strapless Monique Lhuillier gown with Yves Saint
   Laurent heels. "That moment of seeing Jessica, oh my God, it was
   magical. It will stay with me forever," said Allen.

   The actor will soon reprise his role as Tom Branson in the Downton
   Abbey film which is scheduled for release in September. Leech attended
   last night's Critics' Choice Awards, during which he and the cast of
   Bohemian Rhapsody presented the award for Best Supporting Actress to
   Regina Beale for If Beale Street Could Talk.

   New York Fashion Week has arrived, and Harper’s BAZAAR fêted the most

   black tie best, Alicia Keys gave a stunning performance as Belvedere,
   Whispering Angel, and Moët & Chandon poured the night’s signature sips.
   With Cartier acting as the exclusive Maison partner with BAZAAR, the
