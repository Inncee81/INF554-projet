   Icon: Clinical Trial Data Sharing

Clinical Trial Data Sharing

   Clinical trials generate vast amounts of data, yet a large portion of
   this information is never published or made available to other
   researchers. Data sharing could advance scientific discovery and
   improve clinical care, but it involves potential risks and costs for
   key stakeholders, including clinical trialists, sponsors, researchers,
   and patients. Our publications discuss the challenges and opportunities
   for stakeholders to better harmonize incentives, policy, data
   standards, and governance to encourage the sharing and reuse of
   clinical trial data sharing.

Evolution

   How did life evolve on Earth? The answer can help us understand our
   past and prepare for our future. This collection documents the
   overwhelming evidence in support of biological evolution, stresses the
   importance of biodiversity and ecosystem management, and evaluates the
   alternative perspectives offered by various kinds of creationism. These
   reports also focus on how science and religion can be viewed as
   different ways of understanding the world, rather than as frameworks
   that are in conflict with each other. For educators, students,
   teachers, community leaders, legislators, policy makers, and parents
   who seek to better understand all aspects of evolutionary science, this

   Icon: Reproducibility

Reproducibility

   Reproducibility is a hallmark of good science because it provides
   researchers with the tools to address computational errors and ensure
   the integrity of the results in scientific research. An inconsistency
   can be an important precursor to a new discovery, or reveal otherwise
   unidentifiable miscalculations. However, there is not currently a
   system that structures how computational scientific data is reported,
   published, and shared. When a newly reported scientific study has
   far-reaching implications, it is critical for the data to be accessible
   for others to recompute and verify. Our reports discuss the importance
   and challenges of fostering reproducibility in science.
