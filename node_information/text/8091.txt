Why We Disagree With the Bundeskartellamt

   By Yvonne Cunnane, Head of Data Protection, Facebook Ireland and Nikhil
   Shanbhag, Director and Associate General Counsel

   Today, Germany’s Bundeskartellamt (FCO) issued an order in the inquiry
   it began in March 2016. While we’ve cooperated with the
   Bundeskartellamt for nearly three years and will continue our
   discussions, we disagree with their conclusions and intend to appeal so
   that people in Germany continue to benefit fully from all our services.
   The Bundeskartellamt underestimates the fierce competition we face in
   Germany, misinterprets our compliance with GDPR and undermines the
   mechanisms European law provides for ensuring consistent data
   protection standards across the EU.

   The protection of personal data is a fundamental right in the EU and
   everyone gets equal protections as part of the GDPR regardless of the
   size of the company involved. Over the past year, lawmakers and data
   protection regulators have put in place new safeguards over people’s
   information, raised fair questions about the practices of many
   companies, including Facebook, and initiated investigations when
   warranted. We support the GDPR and take our obligations seriously. Yet
   the Bundeskartellamt’s decision misapplies German competition law to
   set different rules that apply to only one company.

   Popularity is not dominance. The Bundeskartellamt found in its own
   survey that over 40% of social media users in Germany don’t even use
   Facebook. We face fierce competition in Germany, yet the
   Bundeskartellamt finds it irrelevant that our apps compete directly
   with YouTube, Snapchat, Twitter and others.

   Facebook complies with the GDPR and is accountable for protecting
   people’s information. The GDPR went into effect less than a year ago
   and imposed new requirements on all companies operating in the EU,
   including Facebook. As part of complying with the GDPR, we revamped the
   information we provide people about their privacy and the controls they
   have over their information. We’ve introduced new and improved privacy
   experiences for everyone on Facebook, including asking everyone around
   the world to make choices about the ads they see and more. We’ll soon
   introduce Clear History, a tool where you’ll be able to see the
   information we receive from the websites and services who use our
   business tools and disassociate it from your account. The
   Bundeskartellamt has overlooked how Facebook actually processes data
   and the steps we take to comply with the GDPR.

   The GDPR specifically empowers data protection regulators – not
   competition authorities – to determine whether companies are living up
   to their responsibilities. And data protection regulators certainly
   have the expertise to make those conclusions. The GDPR also harmonizes
   data protection laws across Europe, so everyone lives by the same rules
   of the road and regulators can consistently apply the law from country
   to country. In our case, that’s the Irish Data Protection Commission.
   The Bundeskartellamt’s order threatens to undermine this, providing
   different rights to people based on the size of the companies they do
   business with.

   Using information across services helps to make them better and protect
   people’s safety. Facebook has always been about connecting you with
   people and information you’re interested in. We tailor each person’s
   Facebook experience so it’s unique to you, and we use a variety of
   information to do this – including the information you include on your
   profile, news stories you like or share and what other services share
   with us about your use of their websites and apps. Using information
   across our services also helps us protect people’s safety and security,
   including, for example, identifying abusive behavior and disabling
   accounts tied to terrorism, child exploitation and election
   interference across both Facebook and Instagram.

   Every day, people interact with companies that connect and use data in
   similar ways. And all of this should be – and is – a legitimate area of
   focus for regulators and policymakers around the world. Yet the
   Bundeskartellamt is trying to implement an unconventional standard for
   a single company.

   This is the point we’ll continue to make to the Bundeskartellamt and
   defend these important arguments in court, so that people and
   businesses in Germany can continue to benefit from all of our services.
   We’ll also continue finding ways to improve the controls we offer and
   safeguard people’s information.

Showing More Informative Links in News Feed

   By Adam Mosseri, VP, News Feed

   Today we are making an update to help reduce low quality links in News
   Feed. We are always working to improve people’s experience in News Feed
   by showing more stories that we think people will find informative and
   entertaining.

   Our research shows that there is a tiny group of people on Facebook who
   routinely share vast amounts of public posts per day, effectively
   spamming people’s feeds. Our research further shows that the links they
   share tend to include low quality content such as clickbait,
   sensationalism, and misinformation. As a result, we want to reduce the
   influence of these spammers and deprioritize the links they share more
   frequently than regular sharers. Of course, this is only one signal
   among many others that may affect the ranking prioritization of this
   type of post. This update will only apply to links, such as an
   individual article, not to domains, Pages, videos, photos, check-ins or
   status updates.

   One of our core News Feed values is that News Feed should be
   informative. By taking steps like this to improve News Feed, we’re able
   to surface more stories that people find informative and reduce the
   spread of problematic links such as clickbait, sensationalism and
   misinformation.

   Will This Impact My Page?
   Most publishers won’t see any significant changes to their distribution
   in News Feed. Publishers that get meaningful distribution from people
   who routinely share vast amounts of public posts per day may see a
   reduction in the distribution of those specific links. As always,
   publishers should keep in mind these basic guideposts to reach their
   audience on Facebook and continue to post stories that are relevant to
   their audiences and that their readers find informative.

New Updates to Reduce Clickbait Headlines

   By Arun Babu, Engineer, Annie Liu, Engineer, and Jordan Zhang, Engineer

   People tell us they don’t like stories that are misleading, sensational
   or spammy. That includes clickbait headlines that are designed to get
   attention and lure visitors into clicking on a link. In an effort to
   support an informed community, we’re always working to determine what
   stories might have clickbait headlines so we can show them less often.

   Last year we made an update to News Feed to reduce stories from sources
   that consistently post clickbait headlines that withhold and exaggerate
   information. Today, we are making three updates that build on this work
   so that people will see even fewer clickbait stories in their feeds,
   and more of the stories they find authentic.
     * First, we are now taking into account clickbait at the individual
       post level in addition to the domain and Page level, in order to
       more precisely reduce clickbait headlines.
     * Second, in order to make this more effective, we are dividing our
       efforts into two separate signals — so we will now look at whether
       a headline withholds information or if it exaggerates information
       separately.
     * Third, we are starting to test this work in additional languages.

   How We Are Improving Our Efforts

   One of our News Feed values is authentic communication, so we’ve been
   working to understand what people find authentic and what people do
   not.

   We’ve learned from last year’s update that we can better detect
   different kinds of clickbait headlines by separately — rather than
   jointly — identifying signals that withhold or exaggerate information.

   Headlines that withhold information intentionally leave out crucial
   details or mislead people, forcing them to click to find out the
   answer. For example, “When She Looked Under Her Couch Cushions And Saw
   THIS…” Headlines that exaggerate the details of a story with
   sensational language tend to make the story seem like a bigger deal
   than it really is. For example, “WOW! Ginger tea is the secret to
   everlasting youth. You’ve GOT to see this!”

   We addressed this similarly to how we previously worked to reduce
   clickbait: We categorized hundreds of thousands of headlines as
   clickbait or not clickbait by considering if the headline exaggerates
   the details of a story, and separately if the headline withholds
   information. A team at Facebook reviewed thousands of headlines using
   these criteria, validating each other’s work to identify large sets of
   clickbait headlines.

   From there, we identify what phrases are commonly used in clickbait
   headlines that are not used in other headlines. This is similar to how
   many email spam filters work.

   Posts with clickbait headlines will appear lower in News Feed. We will
   continue to learn over time, and we hope to continue expanding this
   work to reduce clickbait in even more languages.

   Will This Impact My Page?

   We anticipate that most Pages won’t see any significant changes to
   their distribution in News Feed as a result of this update.

   Publishers that rely on clickbait headlines should expect their
   distribution to decrease. Pages should avoid headlines that withhold
   information required to understand the content of the article and
   headlines that exaggerate the article to create misleading
   expectations. If a Page stops posting clickbait and sensational
   headlines, their posts will stop being impacted by this change.

   As always, Pages should refer to our publishing best practices. We will
   learn from these changes and will continue to work on reducing
   clickbait so News Feed is a place for authentic communication.

   Update, 7/11/18: We’ve expanded clickbait demotions to posts in new
   languages, including Romanian, Turkish, Russian, Bulgarian, Dutch,
   Greek, Hungarian, and Hindi.

   Update, 12/4/18: We’ve expanded clickbait demotions to posts in new
   languages, including Indonesian and Bengali.

Reducing Links to Low-Quality Web Page Experiences

   By Jiun-Ren Lin and Shengbo Guo

   We want to help people build an informed community on Facebook. That’s
   why we’re always working to understand which posts people consider
   misleading, sensational and spammy so we can show fewer of those and
   show more informative posts instead.

   We hear from our community that they’re disappointed when they click on
   a link that leads to a web page containing little substantive content
   and that is covered in disruptive, shocking or malicious ads. People
   expect their experience after clicking on a post to be straightforward.

   Starting today, we’re rolling out an update so people see fewer posts
   and ads in News Feed that link to these low-quality web page
   experiences. Similar to the work we’re already doing to stop
   misinformation, this update will help reduce the economic incentives of
   financially-motivated spammers.

   A More Informative Experience

   We have had a policy in place since last year to prevent advertisers
   with low-quality web page experiences from advertising on our platform.
   Now, we are increasing enforcement on ads and also taking into account
   organic posts in News Feed.

   With this update, we reviewed hundreds of thousands of web pages linked
   to from Facebook to identify those that contain little substantive
   content and have a large number of disruptive, shocking or malicious
   ads. We then used artificial intelligence to understand whether new web
   pages shared on Facebook have similar characteristics. So if we
   determine a post might link to these types of low-quality web pages, it
   may show up lower in people’s feeds and may not be eligible to be an
   ad. This way people can see fewer misleading posts and more informative
   posts.

   Will This Impact My Page or Ad Account?

   These changes will roll out gradually over the coming months.
   Publishers that do not have the type of low-quality landing page
   experience referenced may see a small increase in traffic, while
   publishers who do should see a decline in traffic. This update is one
   of many signals we use to rank News Feed, so impact will vary by
   publisher, and Pages should continue posting stories their audiences
   will like.

   For advertisers and publishers looking for tips on how to improve their
   web experiences, please read the full Facebook Business post and visit
   our Help Center.

   Update October 16, 2018: Starting today, we’re rolling out an update so
   people see fewer posts that link out to low-quality sites that
   predominantly copy and republish content from other sites without
   providing unique value. We are adjusting our Publisher Guidelines
   accordingly.

Why We Disagree With the Bundeskartellamt

   By Yvonne Cunnane, Head of Data Protection, Facebook Ireland and Nikhil
   Shanbhag, Director and Associate General Counsel

   Today, Germany’s Bundeskartellamt (FCO) issued an order in the inquiry
   it began in March 2016. While we’ve cooperated with the
   Bundeskartellamt for nearly three years and will continue our
   discussions, we disagree with their conclusions and intend to appeal so
   that people in Germany continue to benefit fully from all our services.
   The Bundeskartellamt underestimates the fierce competition we face in
   Germany, misinterprets our compliance with GDPR and undermines the
   mechanisms European law provides for ensuring consistent data
   protection standards across the EU.

   The protection of personal data is a fundamental right in the EU and
   everyone gets equal protections as part of the GDPR regardless of the

   protection regulators have put in place new safeguards over people’s

   Popularity is not dominance. The Bundeskartellamt found in its own

   business tools and disassociate it from your account. The
   Bundeskartellamt has overlooked how Facebook actually processes data
   and the steps we take to comply with the GDPR.

   The GDPR specifically empowers data protection regulators – not
   competition authorities – to determine whether companies are living up
   to their responsibilities. And data protection regulators certainly
   have the expertise to make those conclusions. The GDPR also harmonizes
   data protection laws across Europe, so everyone lives by the same rules
   of the road and regulators can consistently apply the law from country
   to country. In our case, that’s the Irish Data Protection Commission.
   The Bundeskartellamt’s order threatens to undermine this, providing
   different rights to people based on the size of the companies they do
   business with.

   Using information across services helps to make them better and protect
   people’s safety. Facebook has always been about connecting you with
   people and information you’re interested in. We tailor each person’s
   Facebook experience so it’s unique to you, and we use a variety of
   information to do this – including the information you include on your
   profile, news stories you like or share and what other services share
   with us about your use of their websites and apps. Using information
   across our services also helps us protect people’s safety and security,
   including, for example, identifying abusive behavior and disabling
   accounts tied to terrorism, child exploitation and election
   interference across both Facebook and Instagram.

   Every day, people interact with companies that connect and use data in
   similar ways. And all of this should be – and is – a legitimate area of
   focus for regulators and policymakers around the world. Yet the
   Bundeskartellamt is trying to implement an unconventional standard for
   a single company.

   This is the point we’ll continue to make to the Bundeskartellamt and
   defend these important arguments in court, so that people and
   businesses in Germany can continue to benefit from all of our services.
   We’ll also continue finding ways to improve the controls we offer and
   safeguard people’s information.

Showing More Informative Links in News Feed

   By Adam Mosseri, VP, News Feed

   Today we are making an update to help reduce low quality links in News
   Feed. We are always working to improve people’s experience in News Feed
   by showing more stories that we think people will find informative and
   entertaining.

   Our research shows that there is a tiny group of people on Facebook who
   routinely share vast amounts of public posts per day, effectively
   spamming people’s feeds. Our research further shows that the links they
   share tend to include low quality content such as clickbait,
   sensationalism, and misinformation. As a result, we want to reduce the
   influence of these spammers and deprioritize the links they share more
   frequently than regular sharers. Of course, this is only one signal
   among many others that may affect the ranking prioritization of this
   type of post. This update will only apply to links, such as an
   individual article, not to domains, Pages, videos, photos, check-ins or
   status updates.

   One of our core News Feed values is that News Feed should be
   informative. By taking steps like this to improve News Feed, we’re able
   to surface more stories that people find informative and reduce the
   spread of problematic links such as clickbait, sensationalism and
   misinformation.

   Will This Impact My Page?
   Most publishers won’t see any significant changes to their distribution
   in News Feed. Publishers that get meaningful distribution from people
   who routinely share vast amounts of public posts per day may see a
   reduction in the distribution of those specific links. As always,
   publishers should keep in mind these basic guideposts to reach their
   audience on Facebook and continue to post stories that are relevant to
   their audiences and that their readers find informative.

New Updates to Reduce Clickbait Headlines

   By Arun Babu, Engineer, Annie Liu, Engineer, and Jordan Zhang, Engineer

   People tell us they don’t like stories that are misleading, sensational
   or spammy. That includes clickbait headlines that are designed to get
   attention and lure visitors into clicking on a link. In an effort to
   support an informed community, we’re always working to determine what
   stories might have clickbait headlines so we can show them less often.

   Last year we made an update to News Feed to reduce stories from sources
   that consistently post clickbait headlines that withhold and exaggerate
   information. Today, we are making three updates that build on this work
   so that people will see even fewer clickbait stories in their feeds,
   and more of the stories they find authentic.
     * First, we are now taking into account clickbait at the individual
       post level in addition to the domain and Page level, in order to
       more precisely reduce clickbait headlines.
     * Second, in order to make this more effective, we are dividing our
       efforts into two separate signals — so we will now look at whether
       a headline withholds information or if it exaggerates information
       separately.
     * Third, we are starting to test this work in additional languages.

   How We Are Improving Our Efforts

   One of our News Feed values is authentic communication, so we’ve been
   working to understand what people find authentic and what people do
   not.

   We’ve learned from last year’s update that we can better detect
   different kinds of clickbait headlines by separately — rather than
   jointly — identifying signals that withhold or exaggerate information.

   Headlines that withhold information intentionally leave out crucial
   details or mislead people, forcing them to click to find out the
   answer. For example, “When She Looked Under Her Couch Cushions And Saw
   THIS…” Headlines that exaggerate the details of a story with
   sensational language tend to make the story seem like a bigger deal
   than it really is. For example, “WOW! Ginger tea is the secret to
   everlasting youth. You’ve GOT to see this!”

   We addressed this similarly to how we previously worked to reduce
   clickbait: We categorized hundreds of thousands of headlines as
   clickbait or not clickbait by considering if the headline exaggerates
   the details of a story, and separately if the headline withholds
   information. A team at Facebook reviewed thousands of headlines using
   these criteria, validating each other’s work to identify large sets of
   clickbait headlines.

   From there, we identify what phrases are commonly used in clickbait
   headlines that are not used in other headlines. This is similar to how
   many email spam filters work.

   Posts with clickbait headlines will appear lower in News Feed. We will
   continue to learn over time, and we hope to continue expanding this
   work to reduce clickbait in even more languages.

   Will This Impact My Page?

   We anticipate that most Pages won’t see any significant changes to
   their distribution in News Feed as a result of this update.

   Publishers that rely on clickbait headlines should expect their
   distribution to decrease. Pages should avoid headlines that withhold
   information required to understand the content of the article and
   headlines that exaggerate the article to create misleading
   expectations. If a Page stops posting clickbait and sensational
   headlines, their posts will stop being impacted by this change.

   As always, Pages should refer to our publishing best practices. We will
   learn from these changes and will continue to work on reducing
   clickbait so News Feed is a place for authentic communication.

   Update, 7/11/18: We’ve expanded clickbait demotions to posts in new
   languages, including Romanian, Turkish, Russian, Bulgarian, Dutch,
   Greek, Hungarian, and Hindi.

   Update, 12/4/18: We’ve expanded clickbait demotions to posts in new
   languages, including Indonesian and Bengali.

Reducing Links to Low-Quality Web Page Experiences

   By Jiun-Ren Lin and Shengbo Guo

   We want to help people build an informed community on Facebook. That’s
   why we’re always working to understand which posts people consider
   misleading, sensational and spammy so we can show fewer of those and
   show more informative posts instead.

   We hear from our community that they’re disappointed when they click on
   a link that leads to a web page containing little substantive content
   and that is covered in disruptive, shocking or malicious ads. People
   expect their experience after clicking on a post to be straightforward.

   Starting today, we’re rolling out an update so people see fewer posts
   and ads in News Feed that link to these low-quality web page
   experiences. Similar to the work we’re already doing to stop
   misinformation, this update will help reduce the economic incentives of
   financially-motivated spammers.

   A More Informative Experience

   We have had a policy in place since last year to prevent advertisers
   with low-quality web page experiences from advertising on our platform.
   Now, we are increasing enforcement on ads and also taking into account
   organic posts in News Feed.

   With this update, we reviewed hundreds of thousands of web pages linked
   to from Facebook to identify those that contain little substantive
   content and have a large number of disruptive, shocking or malicious
   ads. We then used artificial intelligence to understand whether new web
   pages shared on Facebook have similar characteristics. So if we
   determine a post might link to these types of low-quality web pages, it
   may show up lower in people’s feeds and may not be eligible to be an
   ad. This way people can see fewer misleading posts and more informative
   posts.

   Will This Impact My Page or Ad Account?

   These changes will roll out gradually over the coming months.
   Publishers that do not have the type of low-quality landing page
   experience referenced may see a small increase in traffic, while
   publishers who do should see a decline in traffic. This update is one
   of many signals we use to rank News Feed, so impact will vary by
   publisher, and Pages should continue posting stories their audiences
   will like.

   For advertisers and publishers looking for tips on how to improve their
   web experiences, please read the full Facebook Business post and visit
   our Help Center.

   Update October 16, 2018: Starting today, we’re rolling out an update so
   people see fewer posts that link out to low-quality sites that
   predominantly copy and republish content from other sites without
   providing unique value. We are adjusting our Publisher Guidelines
   accordingly.
