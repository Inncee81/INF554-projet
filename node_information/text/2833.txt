Aborted babies incinerated to heat UK hospitals

   share
   More than 15,000 aborted or miscarried babies were burned as 'clinical
   waste' an investigation has discovered
     * Sarah Knapton

   24 March 2014 • 7:00 AM

   The bodies of thousands of aborted and miscarried babies were
   incinerated as clinical waste, with some even used to heat hospitals,
   an investigation has found.

   Ten NHS trusts have admitted burning foetal remains alongside other
   rubbish while two others used the bodies in ‘waste-to-energy’ plants
   which generate power for heat.

   Last night the Department of Health issued an instant ban on the
   practice which health minister Dr Dan Poulter branded ‘totally
   unacceptable.’

   At least 15,500 foetal remains were incinerated by 27 NHS trusts over
   the last two years alone, Channel 4’s Dispatches discovered.

   The programme, which will air tonight, found that parents who lose
   children in early pregnancy were often treated without compassion and
   were not consulted about what they wanted to happen to the remains

   One of the country’s leading hospitals, Addenbrooke’s in Cambridge,
   incinerated 797 babies below 13 weeks gestation at their own ‘waste to
   energy’ plant. The mothers were told the remains had been ‘cremated.’

   Another ‘waste to energy’ facility at Ipswich Hospital, operated by a
   private contractor, incinerated 1,101 foetal remains between 2011 and
   2013.

   They were brought in from another hospital before being burned,
   generating energy for the hospital site. Ipswich Hospital itself
   disposes of remains by cremation.

   “This practice is totally unacceptable,” said Dr Poulter.

   “While the vast majority of hospitals are acting in the appropriate
   way, that must be the case for all hospitals and the Human Tissue
   Authority has now been asked to ensure that it acts on this issue
   without delay.”

   Sir Bruce Keogh, NHS Medical Director, has written to all NHS trusts to
   tell them the practice must stop.

   The Chief Medical Officer, Dame Sally Davies, has also written to the
   Human Tissue Authority to ask them make sure that guidance is clear.

   And the Care Quality Commission said it would investigate the
   programme's findings.

   Prof Sir Mike Richards, Chief Inspector of Hospitals, said: “I am
   disappointed trusts may not be informing or consulting women and their
   families.

   “This breaches our standard on respecting and involving people who use
   services and I’m keen for Dispatches to share their evidence with us.

   “We scrutinise information of concern and can inspect unannounced, if
   required.”

   A total of one in seven pregnancies ends in a miscarriage, while NHS
   figures show there are around 4,000 stillbirths each year in the UK, or
   11 each day.

   Ipswich Hospital Trust said it was concerned to discover that foetal
   remains from another hospital had been incinerated on its site.

   A spokeswoman said: “The Ipswich Hospital NHS Trust does not incinerate
   foetal remains.”

   She added that the trust “takes great care over foetal remains”

   A spokesman for the Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust
   said that trained health professionals discuss the options with parents
   ‘both verbally and in writing.’

   "The parents are given exactly the same choice on the disposal of
   foetal remains as for a stillborn child and their personal wishes are
   respected,” they added.

   Self-driving cars will only last four years because they will be used
   so much, a Ford executive has predicted.

   John Rich, operations chief of Ford Autonomous Vehicles, dismissed
   concerns that demand for cars would wane in the future.

   “The thing that worries me least in this world is decreasing demand for
   cars. We will exhaust and crush a car every four years in this
   business,” he told The Telegraph.

   The Detroit-headquartered car maker plans to establish an autonomous
   fleet which will be used as a service by other companies, to be used as
   delivery vehicles or to transport employees.

   Pittsburgh start-up Argo AI, which is developing cars for Ford, is
   currently testing the technology in five cities...

Berlin to impose rent freeze 'so it doesn't end up like London'

   The German finance minister has backed controversial proposals for a
   five-year rent freeze to tackle the rising cost of living in Berlin,
   warning: "We don't want to end up like London”.

   Olaf Scholz, who is also vice-chancellor in Angela Merkel’s coalition
   government, voiced support for plans to block landlords from increasing
   rent on residential properties for five years.

   “If we don't want to end up like London, where even lawyers and doctors
   have to live with flatmates, because they can't afford their own
   apartment, then we have to do something about it,” Mr Scholz told
   Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper.

   Berliners have traditionally revelled in the image of their city as
   “poor but sexy”, as it was famously described by a former mayor, but
   that is increasingly at odds with reality.

   Rents have risen rapidly as Germany’s booming economy has attracted
   people from across Europe, and the city has seen protests from locals
   complaining they are being priced out of the market.

   The Berlin regional government is planning to introduce measures next
   week that would freeze residential rents for the next five years,
   making it illegal for landlords to impose increases.

   But the measure has proved controversial, with at least one landlords’
   association advising its members to raise rents  before the new
   measures can be approved.

   The Haus & Grund association advised landlords to increase rents by 15
   per cent — the maximum currently permitted — before June 18.

   Berlin is by no means Germany's most expensive city. Rents still lag
   behind rivals like Munich, Hamburg and Frankfurt, but they have been
   rising faster than anywhere else in Germany in recent years.

   A typical one-bedroom flat costs €990 (£880) a month to rent in Berlin,
   compared to £1,550 a month in London, according to European Commission
   figures.

   So far the Berlin authorities have resisted calls for more drastic
   action, including controversial proposals to expropriate flats from the
   city’s largest landlords and use them as council housing.

New underground city planned for Amsterdam

   By Bruno Waterfield

   12:01AM GMT 09 Feb 2008

   AMSTERDAM is to go underground as overcrowding and soaring land prices
   force planners to look beneath the city's famous canals for future
   urban development.

   [news-graphics-2008-_440999a.jpg]

   Dutch engineers have unveiled plans for a £7.4 billion underground city
   providing one million square feet of underground retail, leisure and
   parking facilities.

   "There has always been a lack of space in the city, so what we are
   doing is building a city under the city by using a new construction
   technique, which will not interfere with street traffic," said Moshe
   Zwarts, a partner at the architects Zwarts & Jansma.

   Residents of the historic houses that line Amsterdam's central canals
   have to wait up to seven years for parking permits and a garage space
   can cost as much as £74,000.

   Property prices, once a bargain in the Dutch city that is the cultural
   and commercial capital of the Netherlands, are also soaring. The price
   of an apartment in the De Pijp district which cost £90,000 in 1999, has
   risen nine years later to £223,000 or more.

   The one-way streets, on either side of Amsterdam's waterways, are also
   feeling the strain of overcrowding, and traffic is frequently thrown
   into chaos for hours by delivery vans and rubbish collectors.

   Amsterdam was originally built on drained, swampy marshland and many of
   the classic Dutch gabled houses along its canals are still precariously
   supported by underground wooden beams.

   To find space for new developments, the Dutch engineers have decided it
   is easier to build in the clay under the canals.

   Under the plans, canal water will be temporarily pumped out in order to
   start construction beneath.

   "Amsterdam sits on a 30-metre layer of waterproof clay which will be
   used together with concrete and sand to make new walls," said

   Mr Zwarts.

   "Once we have resealed the canal floor, we will be able to carry on
   working underneath while pouring water back into the canals. It's an
   easy technique and it doesn't create issues with drilling noises on the
   streets."

   Youssef Eddini, a spokesman for the Strukton engineering group that
   will build the underground city, has stressed that the new plan will
   not cause as much disruption as other projects.

   "All materials could be brought to the site by water. We can use the
   canals as a road," he said.

   The project has been approved by Amsterdam's city council. Construction
   work, lasting up to 20 years, is expected to begin in 2018.

   Mr Eddini stressed that the project would pay for itself by creating
   more space for property development, cutting the cost of a new parking
   space to £19,000.

Greece: a nation at war with itself

The attack on an Athens bank that left three dead stirred memories of the
blood-spattered years of Greek civil war in the 1940s. Former correspondent
Harry de Quetteville reports that many fear the violence has yet to run its
course.

   Fire and fury: Athenians gather yesterday outside the bank that was
   torched Photo: Dimitar Dilkoff

   By Harry de Quetteville

   5:12AM BST 07 May 2010

   When 44-year-old Marie-Therese Iatrou, who lives in a comfortable
   suburb outside Athens, spoke this week to her mother, Renna Nezos, she
   detected a note of panic in the 78-year-old's voice.

   "I want to come and live with you outside the city," said Mrs Nezos,
   whose childhood home was occupied by the Nazis and who has vivid
   memories of the bloodshed of the civil war that followed. "I've seen
   this before."

   On the streets outside Mrs Nezos's window in the centre of Athens, tens
   of thousands of demonstrators were preparing to march against the
   extraordinary package of austerity measures imposed alongside the joint
   EU-IMF bailout that has saved the country from immediate bankruptcy.

   To most observers of Greek street politics, there is nothing new, or
   particularly threatening, about the prospect of mass protest in this
   hot-blooded Mediterranean country, politically charged and potentially
   violent though such protest can be.

   As a correspondent based for several years in Athens, I became used to
   the sight of demonstrators parading through the city. Stones are
   routinely hurled; the police routinely respond with tear gas. The
   British and American embassies, regular targets of demonstrators' ire,
   are not built like fortresses for nothing. Protests make for good
   television reports, before everyone forgets about them the
   next day.

   Indeed, the very idea of protestors demanding rights and brandishing
   hammer-and-sickle flags (such as those draped from the Acropolis this
   Tuesday) can seem laughably anachronistic. Tame, almost. For years,
   many of Greece's wealthiest people – those in the northern suburbs of
   Athens with the swimming pools that they are now hiding from the
   taxman; those with the boltholes on Mykonos, built beautifully, but
   illegally, too close to the shoreline – may have regarded the man on
   the street with disdain,
   not fear.

   But on Wednesday that changed. Granted, some amid the crowds venting
   fury about the terms of the bailout were anarchists who sought to sow
   chaos and violent disruption for its own sake. The majority were not.
   Many in the huge crowds were those who felt that they had been cheated
   by the rich. The air was thick with a sense of injustice. And as three
   charred bodies were pulled from a bank that had been torched, the
   spectre of something altogether more sinister than just the usual run
   of riots hovered over Greece – class war.

   It is to be hoped that the deaths have some positive legacy. They have
   shocked many. Even anarchists happy to dispatch a bank branch with a
   Molotov cocktail will pause at the prospect of body bags.

   But as the demonstrators chanted "Thieves, thieves" on Wednesday, there
   will have been many in Greek society who know that the cry is addressed
   to them: industrialists; politicians; even parts of the Orthodox Church
   that plays such a huge part in Greek life – all stand accused of
   milking the rest of society.

   In the worst-case scenario, it may be payback time. Poor against rich.
   Masses against elite. There are plenty who feel they have little, on
   earnings of just a few hundred euros a month, to lose.

   Will the crowds limit themselves to slogans draped across the Acropolis
   in future? Or will demonstrators who are usually dismissed as relics of
   the past actually storm the bastions of privilege that surround them
   today? It may seem unlikely to far-off observers, but not so to those
   of a certain vintage in Greece, particularly those who lived through
   the 1946-49 war that pitted Greece's communists against the US and
   UK-backed Right.

   "Everyone from my mother's generation who lived through the civil war
   is worried," says Ms Iatrou. "It was a very bloody conflict. And the
   Communist Party is still a powerful force here. My mother is coming to
   stay with us because she is sure it's going to happen again.

   "For people of my generation, that sounds excessive, but my mother just
   says, 'You don't know, you didn't live through it'. My aunt told me
   that
   about the civil war – about how
   friendly neighbours could change overnight and become enemies. It was
   brutal."

   In the darkest days of the civil war, Mrs Nezos, then a teenager, was
   forced to live off scraps for weeks. It is no surprise that she is now
   telling her daughter to stock up on supplies.

   Only a few years ago, as Greece beggared itself to build the venues for
   the Olympic Games of 2004, the prospect of pitchfork-wielding mobs
   rampaging through the feted streets of antiquity seemed ludicrous. But
   even then, the seeds of Greece's current crisis were there for all to
   see. Not in the vast sums that the country spent, and could ill-afford
   to spend, on the Games (although such profligacy hardly helped), but in
   the fact that everyone knew that Greece was beggaring itself. There was
   no attempt to conceal the disorganisation, and the overspending that
   resulted.

   In its determination to host the Games, the nation agreed to avert its
   eyes from the realities of the situation. It was a conspiracy of
   silence among an entire population. Eleven million people knew exactly
   what was happening. They simply chose not to talk about it.

   And the same is true today. Those tens of thousands ripping up Athens
   may be calling for heads to roll and venting what seems to be a
   bottomless supply of fury at their politicians, but the truth is that
   the vast majority of them are certain to have conspired, at some level,
   with the system of deceit and corruption that has now brought Greece to
   its knees.

   Tax avoidance is the obvious issue but it is only the tip of the
   iceberg, only the most obvious symptom of a disease that runs
   throughout Greek society. The demonstrators may claim that it is not
   they but the rich who are corrupt, who have thrived on dodgy business
   deals, who have bribed officials to circumvent every law in the statute
   book.

   But the truth is that petty corruption is just as rife. Everyone from
   doctors to taxi drivers cooks their books. Innumerable buildings have
   steel girders protruding up from what appears to be the roof. Otherwise
   the structures are complete and inhabited, but if the girders remain in
   place, the building is deemed unfinished and therefore not liable to
   the taxman.

   This is a close society where favours, friends and connections matter.
   Patronage is the rule, not the exception. But the hypocrisy of Greek
   demonstrators is that this is a two-way system. They may be outraged at
   the politicians who have run for office in return for offers of cosy
   jobs in the civil service, but huge numbers have accepted those jobs.

   Rather than reject the grey economy of everyday bribes and backhanders,
   Greeks have learned to live with the system. Who can blame them? It has
   been too pervasive to avoid.

   There have been particularly egregious offenders, and it would
   certainly calm the situation if a propitious sacrifice were made and
   some high-profile figures were carted off to jail. But the reality is
   that the guilt in Greece is collective. Everyone has been corrupt,
   everyone is to blame.

   In this apparently gloomy conclusion, however, lies the key to Greece's
   redemption. Deep down, most Greeks accept that it is not just the
   politicians who have sinned. They, too, are to blame and must now
   repent.

   "The majority of Greeks are clear that things will have to change,"
   says Ms Iatrou. "They understand that everyone will have to pay, that
   Greece will just have to grow up."

   In adversity, a nation draws together. Instead of heading to the
   precipice of division and civil conflict, Greeks must know that they
   have a common enemy and must fight together. Yet many also acknowledge
   that their first loyalties are not to the common good, but to
   themselves and their families.

   That may be about to change for the better. Yesterday the Greek
   government said it would press ahead with austerity reforms despite
   their deep unpopularity. "We know the political cost is very high but
   we accept this in full conscience," said finance minister George
   Papaconstantinou.

   And if Greece's politicians – long derided, now despised – can suddenly
   find it within themselves to do the right thing, surely it is not
   beyond the Greek people?

Aborted babies incinerated to heat UK hospitals

   share
   More than 15,000 aborted or miscarried babies were burned as 'clinical
   waste' an investigation has discovered
     * Sarah Knapton

   24 March 2014 • 7:00 AM

   The bodies of thousands of aborted and miscarried babies were
   incinerated as clinical waste, with some even used to heat hospitals,
   an investigation has found.

   Ten NHS trusts have admitted burning foetal remains alongside other
   rubbish while two others used the bodies in ‘waste-to-energy’ plants
   which generate power for heat.

   Last night the Department of Health issued an instant ban on the
   practice which health minister Dr Dan Poulter branded ‘totally
   unacceptable.’

   At least 15,500 foetal remains were incinerated by 27 NHS trusts over
   the last two years alone, Channel 4’s Dispatches discovered.

   The programme, which will air tonight, found that parents who lose
   children in early pregnancy were often treated without compassion and
   were not consulted about what they wanted to happen to the remains

   One of the country’s leading hospitals, Addenbrooke’s in Cambridge,
   incinerated 797 babies below 13 weeks gestation at their own ‘waste to
   energy’ plant. The mothers were told the remains had been ‘cremated.’

   Another ‘waste to energy’ facility at Ipswich Hospital, operated by a
   private contractor, incinerated 1,101 foetal remains between 2011 and
   2013.

   They were brought in from another hospital before being burned,
   generating energy for the hospital site. Ipswich Hospital itself
   disposes of remains by cremation.

   “This practice is totally unacceptable,” said Dr Poulter.

   “While the vast majority of hospitals are acting in the appropriate
   way, that must be the case for all hospitals and the Human Tissue
   Authority has now been asked to ensure that it acts on this issue
   without delay.”

   Sir Bruce Keogh, NHS Medical Director, has written to all NHS trusts to
   tell them the practice must stop.

   The Chief Medical Officer, Dame Sally Davies, has also written to the
   Human Tissue Authority to ask them make sure that guidance is clear.

   And the Care Quality Commission said it would investigate the
   programme's findings.

   Prof Sir Mike Richards, Chief Inspector of Hospitals, said: “I am
   disappointed trusts may not be informing or consulting women and their
   families.

   “This breaches our standard on respecting and involving people who use
   services and I’m keen for Dispatches to share their evidence with us.

   “We scrutinise information of concern and can inspect unannounced, if
   required.”

   A total of one in seven pregnancies ends in a miscarriage, while NHS
   figures show there are around 4,000 stillbirths each year in the UK, or
   11 each day.

   Ipswich Hospital Trust said it was concerned to discover that foetal
   remains from another hospital had been incinerated on its site.

   A spokeswoman said: “The Ipswich Hospital NHS Trust does not incinerate
   foetal remains.”

   She added that the trust “takes great care over foetal remains”

   A spokesman for the Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust
   said that trained health professionals discuss the options with parents
   ‘both verbally and in writing.’

   "The parents are given exactly the same choice on the disposal of
   foetal remains as for a stillborn child and their personal wishes are
   respected,” they added.

   Self-driving cars will only last four years because they will be used
   so much, a Ford executive has predicted.

   John Rich, operations chief of Ford Autonomous Vehicles, dismissed
   concerns that demand for cars would wane in the future.

   “The thing that worries me least in this world is decreasing demand for
   cars. We will exhaust and crush a car every four years in this
   business,” he told The Telegraph.

   The Detroit-headquartered car maker plans to establish an autonomous
   fleet which will be used as a service by other companies, to be used as
   delivery vehicles or to transport employees.

   Pittsburgh start-up Argo AI, which is developing cars for Ford, is
   currently testing the technology in five cities...

Berlin to impose rent freeze 'so it doesn't end up like London'

   The German finance minister has backed controversial proposals for a
   five-year rent freeze to tackle the rising cost of living in Berlin,
   warning: "We don't want to end up like London”.

   Olaf Scholz, who is also vice-chancellor in Angela Merkel’s coalition
   government, voiced support for plans to block landlords from increasing
   rent on residential properties for five years.

   “If we don't want to end up like London, where even lawyers and doctors
   have to live with flatmates, because they can't afford their own
   apartment, then we have to do something about it,” Mr Scholz told
   Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper.

   Berliners have traditionally revelled in the image of their city as
   “poor but sexy”, as it was famously described by a former mayor, but
   that is increasingly at odds with reality.

   Rents have risen rapidly as Germany’s booming economy has attracted
   people from across Europe, and the city has seen protests from locals
   complaining they are being priced out of the market.

   The Berlin regional government is planning to introduce measures next
   week that would freeze residential rents for the next five years,
   making it illegal for landlords to impose increases.

   But the measure has proved controversial, with at least one landlords’
   association advising its members to raise rents  before the new
   measures can be approved.

   The Haus & Grund association advised landlords to increase rents by 15
   per cent — the maximum currently permitted — before June 18.

   Berlin is by no means Germany's most expensive city. Rents still lag
   behind rivals like Munich, Hamburg and Frankfurt, but they have been
   rising faster than anywhere else in Germany in recent years.

   A typical one-bedroom flat costs €990 (£880) a month to rent in Berlin,
   compared to £1,550 a month in London, according to European Commission
   figures.

   So far the Berlin authorities have resisted calls for more drastic
   action, including controversial proposals to expropriate flats from the
   city’s largest landlords and use them as council housing.

New underground city planned for Amsterdam

   By Bruno Waterfield

   12:01AM GMT 09 Feb 2008

   AMSTERDAM is to go underground as overcrowding and soaring land prices
   force planners to look beneath the city's famous canals for future
   urban development.

   [news-graphics-2008-_440999a.jpg]

   Dutch engineers have unveiled plans for a £7.4 billion underground city
   providing one million square feet of underground retail, leisure and
   parking facilities.

   "There has always been a lack of space in the city, so what we are
   doing is building a city under the city by using a new construction
   technique, which will not interfere with street traffic," said Moshe
   Zwarts, a partner at the architects Zwarts & Jansma.

   Residents of the historic houses that line Amsterdam's central canals
   have to wait up to seven years for parking permits and a garage space
   can cost as much as £74,000.

   Property prices, once a bargain in the Dutch city that is the cultural
   and commercial capital of the Netherlands, are also soaring. The price
   of an apartment in the De Pijp district which cost £90,000 in 1999, has
   risen nine years later to £223,000 or more.

   The one-way streets, on either side of Amsterdam's waterways, are also
   feeling the strain of overcrowding, and traffic is frequently thrown
   into chaos for hours by delivery vans and rubbish collectors.

   Amsterdam was originally built on drained, swampy marshland and many of
   the classic Dutch gabled houses along its canals are still precariously
   supported by underground wooden beams.

   To find space for new developments, the Dutch engineers have decided it
   is easier to build in the clay under the canals.

   Under the plans, canal water will be temporarily pumped out in order to
   start construction beneath.

   "Amsterdam sits on a 30-metre layer of waterproof clay which will be
   used together with concrete and sand to make new walls," said

   Mr Zwarts.

   "Once we have resealed the canal floor, we will be able to carry on
   working underneath while pouring water back into the canals. It's an
   easy technique and it doesn't create issues with drilling noises on the
   streets."

   Youssef Eddini, a spokesman for the Strukton engineering group that
   will build the underground city, has stressed that the new plan will
   not cause as much disruption as other projects.

   "All materials could be brought to the site by water. We can use the
   canals as a road," he said.

   The project has been approved by Amsterdam's city council. Construction
   work, lasting up to 20 years, is expected to begin in 2018.

   Mr Eddini stressed that the project would pay for itself by creating
   more space for property development, cutting the cost of a new parking
   space to £19,000.

Greece: a nation at war with itself

The attack on an Athens bank that left three dead stirred memories of the
blood-spattered years of Greek civil war in the 1940s. Former correspondent
Harry de Quetteville reports that many fear the violence has yet to run its
course.

   Fire and fury: Athenians gather yesterday outside the bank that was
   torched Photo: Dimitar Dilkoff

   By Harry de Quetteville

   5:12AM BST 07 May 2010

   When 44-year-old Marie-Therese Iatrou, who lives in a comfortable
   suburb outside Athens, spoke this week to her mother, Renna Nezos, she
   detected a note of panic in the 78-year-old's voice.

   "I want to come and live with you outside the city," said Mrs Nezos,
   whose childhood home was occupied by the Nazis and who has vivid
   memories of the bloodshed of the civil war that followed. "I've seen
   this before."

   On the streets outside Mrs Nezos's window in the centre of Athens, tens
   of thousands of demonstrators were preparing to march against the
   extraordinary package of austerity measures imposed alongside the joint
   EU-IMF bailout that has saved the country from immediate bankruptcy.

   To most observers of Greek street politics, there is nothing new, or
   particularly threatening, about the prospect of mass protest in this
   hot-blooded Mediterranean country, politically charged and potentially
   violent though such protest can be.

   As a correspondent based for several years in Athens, I became used to
   the sight of demonstrators parading through the city. Stones are
   routinely hurled; the police routinely respond with tear gas. The
   British and American embassies, regular targets of demonstrators' ire,
   are not built like fortresses for nothing. Protests make for good
   television reports, before everyone forgets about them the
   next day.

   Indeed, the very idea of protestors demanding rights and brandishing
   hammer-and-sickle flags (such as those draped from the Acropolis this
   Tuesday) can seem laughably anachronistic. Tame, almost. For years,
   many of Greece's wealthiest people – those in the northern suburbs of
   Athens with the swimming pools that they are now hiding from the
   taxman; those with the boltholes on Mykonos, built beautifully, but
   illegally, too close to the shoreline – may have regarded the man on
   the street with disdain,
   not fear.

   But on Wednesday that changed. Granted, some amid the crowds venting
   fury about the terms of the bailout were anarchists who sought to sow
   chaos and violent disruption for its own sake. The majority were not.
   Many in the huge crowds were those who felt that they had been cheated
   by the rich. The air was thick with a sense of injustice. And as three
   charred bodies were pulled from a bank that had been torched, the
   spectre of something altogether more sinister than just the usual run
   of riots hovered over Greece – class war.

   It is to be hoped that the deaths have some positive legacy. They have
   shocked many. Even anarchists happy to dispatch a bank branch with a
   Molotov cocktail will pause at the prospect of body bags.

   But as the demonstrators chanted "Thieves, thieves" on Wednesday, there
   will have been many in Greek society who know that the cry is addressed
   to them: industrialists; politicians; even parts of the Orthodox Church
   that plays such a huge part in Greek life – all stand accused of
   milking the rest of society.

   In the worst-case scenario, it may be payback time. Poor against rich.
   Masses against elite. There are plenty who feel they have little, on
   earnings of just a few hundred euros a month, to lose.

   Will the crowds limit themselves to slogans draped across the Acropolis
   in future? Or will demonstrators who are usually dismissed as relics of
   the past actually storm the bastions of privilege that surround them
   today? It may seem unlikely to far-off observers, but not so to those
   of a certain vintage in Greece, particularly those who lived through
   the 1946-49 war that pitted Greece's communists against the US and
   UK-backed Right.

   "Everyone from my mother's generation who lived through the civil war
   is worried," says Ms Iatrou. "It was a very bloody conflict. And the
   Communist Party is still a powerful force here. My mother is coming to
   stay with us because she is sure it's going to happen again.

   "For people of my generation, that sounds excessive, but my mother just
   says, 'You don't know, you didn't live through it'. My aunt told me
   that
   about the civil war – about how
   friendly neighbours could change overnight and become enemies. It was
   brutal."

   In the darkest days of the civil war, Mrs Nezos, then a teenager, was
   forced to live off scraps for weeks. It is no surprise that she is now
   telling her daughter to stock up on supplies.

   Only a few years ago, as Greece beggared itself to build the venues for
   the Olympic Games of 2004, the prospect of pitchfork-wielding mobs
   rampaging through the feted streets of antiquity seemed ludicrous. But
   even then, the seeds of Greece's current crisis were there for all to
   see. Not in the vast sums that the country spent, and could ill-afford
   to spend, on the Games (although such profligacy hardly helped), but in
   the fact that everyone knew that Greece was beggaring itself. There was
   no attempt to conceal the disorganisation, and the overspending that
   resulted.

   In its determination to host the Games, the nation agreed to avert its
   eyes from the realities of the situation. It was a conspiracy of
   silence among an entire population. Eleven million people knew exactly
   what was happening. They simply chose not to talk about it.

   And the same is true today. Those tens of thousands ripping up Athens
   may be calling for heads to roll and venting what seems to be a
   bottomless supply of fury at their politicians, but the truth is that
   the vast majority of them are certain to have conspired, at some level,
   with the system of deceit and corruption that has now brought Greece to
   its knees.

   Tax avoidance is the obvious issue but it is only the tip of the
   iceberg, only the most obvious symptom of a disease that runs
   throughout Greek society. The demonstrators may claim that it is not
   they but the rich who are corrupt, who have thrived on dodgy business
   deals, who have bribed officials to circumvent every law in the statute
   book.

   But the truth is that petty corruption is just as rife. Everyone from
   doctors to taxi drivers cooks their books. Innumerable buildings have
   steel girders protruding up from what appears to be the roof. Otherwise
   the structures are complete and inhabited, but if the girders remain in
   place, the building is deemed unfinished and therefore not liable to
   the taxman.

   This is a close society where favours, friends and connections matter.
   Patronage is the rule, not the exception. But the hypocrisy of Greek
   demonstrators is that this is a two-way system. They may be outraged at
   the politicians who have run for office in return for offers of cosy
   jobs in the civil service, but huge numbers have accepted those jobs.

   Rather than reject the grey economy of everyday bribes and backhanders,
   Greeks have learned to live with the system. Who can blame them? It has
   been too pervasive to avoid.

   There have been particularly egregious offenders, and it would
   certainly calm the situation if a propitious sacrifice were made and
   some high-profile figures were carted off to jail. But the reality is
   that the guilt in Greece is collective. Everyone has been corrupt,
   everyone is to blame.

   In this apparently gloomy conclusion, however, lies the key to Greece's
   redemption. Deep down, most Greeks accept that it is not just the
   politicians who have sinned. They, too, are to blame and must now
   repent.

   "The majority of Greeks are clear that things will have to change,"
   says Ms Iatrou. "They understand that everyone will have to pay, that
   Greece will just have to grow up."

   In adversity, a nation draws together. Instead of heading to the
   precipice of division and civil conflict, Greeks must know that they
   have a common enemy and must fight together. Yet many also acknowledge
   that their first loyalties are not to the common good, but to
   themselves and their families.

   That may be about to change for the better. Yesterday the Greek
   government said it would press ahead with austerity reforms despite
   their deep unpopularity. "We know the political cost is very high but
   we accept this in full conscience," said finance minister George
   Papaconstantinou.

   And if Greece's politicians – long derided, now despised – can suddenly
   find it within themselves to do the right thing, surely it is not
   beyond the Greek people?
