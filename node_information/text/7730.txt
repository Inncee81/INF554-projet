Gaganyaan mission: IAF to pick 10 potential astronauts in 2 months, Isro
chief says

   Surendra Singh | TNN | Updated: Jun 12, 2019, 4:25 IST

Highlights

     * Air Force will screen and select 10 potential crew members for
       India's first manned space mission in two months
     * Isro chairman K Sivan said that the space agency will choose the
       final three astronauts from the ten people who the IAF would train
     * India's first manned space mission is slated for early 2021

   The Indian Air Force (IAF) will “screen and select 10 potential crew
   members for the country’s first manned space mission in two months”.
   Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) chairman K Sivan told TOI
   that the space agency will choose the final three astronauts from the
   ten people who the IAF would train.
   The Isro chief said, “We have an agreement with the IAF for crew
   training at Isro’s Human Space Flight Centre in Bengaluru. IAF will
   screen around 10 crew members for the mission. This screening and
   selection will happen within one to two months. Isro will finally
   choose three members from these 10 crew members for the human
   spaceflight mission.”
   Preparations for the country’s first manned mission to space are in
   full swing as Isro recently held its first meeting of the national
   advisory council (NAC), where representatives of all organisations and
   institutes involved in the Gaganyaan project participated. The agency
   also tested CE-20 engine, meant for the upper stage of human-rated GSLV
   MK-III, which will be carrying Indian astronauts to space.
   Speaking to TOI, Sivan said, “In the NAC meet on June 8, Air
   Vice-Marshal R G K Kapoor, assistant chief of air staff operations
   (space), Rear Admiral D S Gujarl, assistant chief of naval staff,
   Defence Research and Development Organisation director G Satheesh
   Reddy, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited chairman and managing director R
   Madhavan and veterans of different institutes attended the meeting. All
   these agencies will play crucial roles in the mission. Whilel the IAF
   will handle crew selection and training, DRDO will provide the life
   support system for crew and Navy will help in recovering the human
   capsule once it re-enters the atmosphere and splashes down in sea.”
   The Isro chairman said the meeting, also attended by former Indian
   astronaut Rakesh Sharma, discussed the overall plan, including crew
   training. “The NAC is mandated to meet once in six months to review the
   preparedness of the mission (scheduled to be launched before or by
   2021). But we have decided to initially hold the review meeting once in
   three months in order to streamline the process,” he said.
   On the Chandrayaan-2 mission, Sivan said “the integration of GSLV Mk
   III has been going on at Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota for
   quite some time. However, the lunarcraft will be on display at
   Bengaluru’s U R Rao Satellite Centre for the media for the next two
   days before being taken to Sriharikota for integration with the GSLV
   rocket”.

     Gaganyaan: India chooses Russia to pick & train astronauts

Gaganyaan: India chooses Russia to pick & train astronauts

   Chethan Kumar | TNN | Updated: Jul 1, 2019, 23:29 IST

   BENGALURU: Even as India and the US spar over the former’s defence
   contracts with Russia, the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro)
   has finally signed the agreement to get its astronauts for the proposed
   Gaganyaan mission trained in Russia, even as other countries including
   the US and France were being considered initially.
   Isro chairman K Sivan told TOI in March that the agency was most likely
   to pick Russia given that the two agencies have had previous
   experience—Russian took India’s Rakesh Sharma to space—and the
   Institute of Aerospace Medicine (IAM) under the Indian Air Force (IAF)
   has also worked with Russia.
   Rakesh Sharma, who is also a member of the National Advisory Council
   (NAC) advising Isro on the Gaganyaan mission, told TOI: “I think it’s
   logical to go with Russia as it has been tried and tested. We’ve used
   the facility before and therefore it makes eminent sense. Although I am
   unaware of the state of readiness of the other training establishments.
   And, given the tight timelines that we have this appears most logical.”
   On Monday, Natalia Lokteva, first deputy director general, Glavkosmos—a
   subsidiary of Roscosmos State Corporation (Russia’s space agency)—and S
   Unnikrishnan Nair, director, Human Space Flight Centre (HSFC) of Isro,
   signed a contract for “selection support, medical examination and space
   training of Indian astronauts.”
   An official statement issued by Glavkosmos confirming the contract,
   read: “Glavkosmos will render to HSFC services on consulting support of
   selection of candidates for the Indian astronauts, providing medical
   examination of the candidates for access to space flight related
   training program and providing space flight related training for the
   Indian astronauts selected on the basis of the medical examination,”
   said in a statement released Monday.
   The work will be provided with the support of the Federal State Budget
   Organization, UA Gagarin Research & Test Cosmonaut Training Center, and
   the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of
   Sciences.
   “As part of the documents we had given IAF we had described the kind of
   requirement and involvement of foreign agencies for training and so on…
   The training will be at three levels. After the rigorous selection
   progress, two levels of training will be done at IAM and the third
   level will be done abroad. Simulation of the real space environment,
   parabolic flights and training in the spacecraft et al will be done
   abroad,” Sivan had earlier told TOI.
   Russia also trains astronauts from across the world seeking to go the
   near earth orbits. “As you well know that presently the only access to
   space to near earth orbit is provided by the Russians. And therefore no
   matter which crew goes up into orbit, the final training is done in
   Russia as they have to equip themselves with the systems of the Russian
   spacecraft,” Sharma said.
   Isro established the HSFC to develop life support systems, crew
   training and planning for future missions under Gaganyaan.
   During his visit in September 2018, Jean-Yves Le Gall, president,
   French space agency—Centro Nacional de Estudios Espaciales (CNES)—
   announced a working group for Gaganyaan and told said that there are a
   lot of areas of human spaceflight that France has expertise in which it
   would like to offer. “We even have expertise in astronauts’ training,”
   Gall had told TOI, adding that the agency was keen on partnering with
   Isro.

Yes Bank shares continue to fall, tumble nearly 9 pc

   PTI | Aug 21, 2019, 16:31 IST

   Yes Bank shares continue to fall, tumble nearly 9 pc
   New Delhi, Aug 21 () Shares of Yes Bank on Wednesday also tumbled
   nearly 9 per cent amid concerns over its exposure to CG Power and
   Industrial Solutions which has been hit by alleged financial
   irregularities and unauthorised transactions.

   The stock dropped 8.21 per cent to close at Rs 65.40 on the BSE. During
   the day, it tanked 9.47 per cent to Rs 64.50 -- its 52-week low.

   On the National Stock Exchange (NSE), the company's shares plummeted
   8.63 per cent to close at Rs 65.05 apiece.
