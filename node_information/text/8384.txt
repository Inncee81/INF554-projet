Shawn Mendes Confirms He's In A Relationship, Duh

Shawn Mendes Finally Confirmed What We All Guessed: He’s In A Relationship

   Shawn Mendes has been the subject of love rumors for some time. After a
   steamy performance at the MTV Video Music Awards with Camila Cabello,
   those rumors reached a fever pitch. And now, Mendes has confirmed that
   he’s in a relationship, but he’s keeping coy on the identity of his
   other half.
   “Honestly, I wanna say I wanna talk to you guys about this stuff, but
   it’s not just me in the relationship,” said Mendes, as he chatted with
   fans. “There’s another person involved and I can’t say things that I
   feel. It’s not just me deciding, you know?” In other words, Mendes is
   choosing not to kiss and tell. What a gentleman.

   Still, fans are convinced his new love interest is Cabello, especially
   after the two were spotted kissing in a pool. Maybe concrete
   confirmation will come from Cabello in the form of her new album? She
   teased her new video for “What Do I Know About Love?” and, well, maybe
   she’ll tell us what she knows about love in her music, or at her
   upcoming Saturday Night Live performance on October 12.
   Until they confirm it outright, it’s still speculation — even though
   Mendes and Cabello are doing the paparazzi equivalent of basically
   singing it from the mountains. The evidence overwhelming; honestly, it
   would be a shock if isn’t wasn’t Cabello. The “Señorita” music video
   had shippers fanning themselves, as the two get very cozy and sweaty.
   She even said he loved him on Instagram. “Happy birthday to this magic
   human, I love you!!!!” wrote Cabello, along with a photo of the two. If
   it walks like a dog, barks like a dog, it’s a Shawmila lovefest.

   Whether you shield yourself behind the round Super Duper Strength, or
   prefer the more angular Deep Freeze, it's hard not to fall in love with
   Karen Walker's signature frames. They can be spotted on nearly every
   influencer's bureau (or brunch table), and on any given holiday wish
   list. The brand has been redefining statement eyewear for years — 10
   years, to be precise. How does one celebrate such a milestone? The
   Karen Walker way involves gilded sunglasses.
   To mark this special anniversary, the designer brings some of her most
   popular designs together in a golden collection aptly titled
   'Celebrate.' The brand is reissuing one frame for every year, starting
   with the Annie from 2005 and working its way to equally popular models
   like the Number One, and dressing them up in a reflective yellow hue.
   In a look book shot by Derek Ketella, Karen Walker convincingly
   suggests the mirrored sunnies, which retail for $350, are perfect for
   any holiday parties you may be attending in the next few months.
   There's cake, confetti, and enviable shades, of course — all the
   ingredients for a major case of FOMO.
   The 'Celebrate' collection is available for purchase now on Karen
   Walker's site, and soon at Barneys, Saks Fifth Avenue, and Shopbop. See
   all the frames in their gilded glory, ahead.

The Real-Life Grand Budapest Hotels You Can Actually Stay In

   Ever since I watched The Grand Budapest Hotel, I've had only one
   question on my mind. How do I get a room there? I can't be the only one
   – who wouldn't want to stay in a pink palace with its own army of
   loyal, purple-suited staff? Once you start dreaming of marble-tiled
   thermal baths and chandelier-strung lobbies, that bargain Airbnb right
   by the airport begins to lose its charm.
   Unfortunately for those desperate to sleep under M. Gustave's roof, The
   Grand Budapest Hotel doesn't actually exist. Wes Anderson took over an
   abandoned shopping centre in Germany for the location of the film, with
   all sets removed at the end of the shoot. Even the signature pink
   frontage was only a set piece.
   But don't despair! From Havana to Prague to London, there are hotels
   all over the world which have the glamour, charm and aesthetic of our
   favourite fictional abode. From pink palaces to art nouveau arches to
   glass-domed walkways, we've found the perfect hotels for anyone who
   fancies bedding down with Wes Anderson (figuratively, of course).

   To some, the term “elope” still conjures images of hasty lovers
   stumbling into clandestine chapels, or frugal pairs looking to save a
   few pennies on the guest list.
   But elopements have changed.
   Today, they’ve become an intimate alternative to a traditional wedding,
   where the details matter less than the vows being exchanged. No longer
   taboo, eloping is an incredibly romantic and wild way for adventurous
   couples to profess their love in some of the most stunning destinations
   around the world. Here are some of our favorite romantic places to
   sneak away to say "I do."
   (Note: Be sure to check out the local embassy’s marriage requirements
   and restrictions before eloping in a foreign country.)

I’ve Been In A Medical Research Group Since I Was A Baby

   Emma North
   (BUTTON) (BUTTON) (BUTTON)

   (BUTTON) (BUTTON)
   PHOTOGRAPHED BY EYLUL ASLAN
   My umbilical cord is in a deep freeze somewhere in Bristol, along with
   my placenta, nail and hair clippings, baby teeth, blood, urine and
   saliva. My whole life, I’ve given biological samples and psychological
   data to a team of researchers at Bristol University. They know my
   innermost thoughts and feelings, my family history, my friendships, how
   quick my reaction times are and how well my ears, eyes, lungs and heart
   function.
   I’m part of a longitudinal medical research group and have been since
   before I was born. My mum signed me up to it when she was in a
   maternity ward in Bristol, about to give birth to me. It was January
   1992 when she noticed a woman walking around with a clipboard, talking
   to expectant mothers. The woman wasn’t dressed like a midwife or a
   doctor, she was a medical research study recruiter. She approached each
   mother-to-be and explained that she was from ALSPAC – Avon Longitudinal
   Study of Parents and Children (also known as Children of the '90s) – a
   birth cohort study looking at the health of children, for scientific
   research. I’m 27 now and still part of the same study.
   Advertisement
   When I tell people this fact about myself, the general assumption is
   that I am a human ‘test monkey’, that I voluntarily nominate myself for
   unsafe clinical trials or that I’m injected with new, potentially
   dangerous treatments and receive financial gain from it. Their reaction
   is a look of worry and scepticism, then inevitable curiosity.
   I started this journey completely oblivious; I was a newborn, after
   all. I’ve since asked my mum why she signed me up. Wasn’t it weird that
   a stranger was walking around a hospital asking after unborn children,
   and did she know what the study would involve? Here's what my mum says:
   “I saw the lady talking to other people. I was curious and actually
   quite pleased when she came to talk to me because I got to find out
   what she was doing. It was a bit odd I suppose, but I didn’t mind as it
   was made very clear that I could back out at any time and it was for
   invaluable research purposes.
   “I knew we would only be in Bristol for a short time so I thought it
   would end when we moved away. I had no idea about everything we were
   going to be asked or for how long but it’s never felt like too much. I
   quite enjoyed the special attention my baby had!”
   We moved to Devon when I was 4 months old and Mum would post my medical
   samples. She’d trim my nails and hair as a baby and put the clippings
   in a pouch to be delivered to the Bristol clinic. Questionnaires came
   through the door asking about the environment I was living and growing
   in; if our house had newly painted walls and if so, what type of paint
   had my parents used; whether our carpets were new; if my parents were
   smokers; was Mum breastfeeding me. My immediate family members were
   also studied, although not quite as in depth – they’d answer questions
   about their health to provide a complete picture of my upbringing.
   Advertisement
   The earliest memory I have of being in the study is attending an
   all-day clinic aged 7. Mum and I were welcomed by a team of volunteers,
   nurses and study professionals. I was brought into a room to give
   blood. I remember the visceral feeling of hunger beforehand – I wasn’t
   allowed to eat anything in order to give a fasted blood sample – and
   the sheer joy of helping myself to the breakfast buffet afterwards. I
   was never in pain, they used numbing cream on my arm and distracted me
   with cartoons on TV. I was never uncomfortable or forced into anything,
   and was constantly reassured that I didn’t have to do anything I didn’t
   want to. I was happy to help, although maybe not fully understanding
   what I was doing at the time. We’d be there from 10am to 5pm and Mum
   would wait for me or come to the sessions when she could – she wasn't
   allowed into the psychological tests or questions about family members
   and my relationships in case her presence altered my responses.
   As I’ve grown older, the questions I’ve been asked have changed and
   become more sensitive. As a teenager I was asked if I had ever been
   touched by a family member in a way that made me feel uncomfortable.
   Had I ever used class A drugs or had thoughts or intentions of suicide?
   I always answered truthfully. Now that my growth has slowed, time
   between clinics has increased; I attend around once every two years.
   The way in which we are treated has grown with us, too. We’re thanked
   and incentives have moved from Disney stickers to shopping vouchers,
   and our transport costs are always reimbursed. The organisation gives
   study participants official letters to ask for a paid/authorised day
   off in the name of medical research, which is useful now that I’m
   working full time.
   Advertisement
   The range of tests I have undertaken for ALSPAC is extensive and the
   same tests are often repeated for age comparison. I’ve had my heart and
   carotid artery scanned, allergies determined, bone density measured, my
   grip strength, lung function, balance, recall, speech and memory put
   through their paces. It’s an incredible insight into your own health.
   The study found that I was asthmatic, that my blood sugar was once too
   high and that I had scoliosis; significant health finds were always
   promptly communicated to my GP and I was advised to come in and speak
   to my doctor. The study also revealed why I’m so sensitive to loud
   noise. I can hear at -5 decibels, which is quieter than a snowflake
   falling to the ground – a fact, ironically, that I like to shout about.
   Luckily, I haven’t been diagnosed with anything serious but I am
   grateful for the opportunity to find out before most people probably
   could.
   In the 21st century, data breaches and misuse of personal information
   is a hot topic. I’m aware that this study has huge quantities of data
   on me but I also know that it’s stored under a unique number assigned
   to me, rather than my name. Has it ever crossed my mind that the study
   could use my DNA in a way I’m unaware of? Of course. Have my siblings
   ever joked that I could be cloned very easily? Yes, and I always
   respond: “Don’t come crying to me when you need my stem cells!” All the
   information this study has collected on me is confidential and
   consensual and I trust that it will be used only for scientific
   research. That mothers should put their babies to sleep on their backs
   to prevent cot death and that peanut allergies can result from peanut
   oil in baby products were both researched and discovered by ALSPAC.
   Information like this saves lives and I’m proud to say that I’m part of
   it.
   Advertisement
   The study will keep going as long as funding is available. It's rare to
   have a tri-generational study and the original participant group of
   more than 14,000 people, to which I belong, are now having their own
   children and ALSPAC has started to recruit the Children of the Children
   of the ‘90s.
   I’d like to meet the founder of ALSPAC, Professor Jean Golding, to
   thank her for including me, for the 2000th academic research paper the
   study has released this year and for creating the most detailed study
   of its kind in the world. In the meantime, I have another clinic to
   attend next month so I’m off to Bristol again. Far from feeling like a
   test monkey, I feel lucky to be part of this and one day I hope to
   enrol my children, too.

Shawn Mendes Finally Confirmed What We All Guessed: He’s In A Relationship

   Shawn Mendes has been the subject of love rumors for some time. After a
   steamy performance at the MTV Video Music Awards with Camila Cabello,
   those rumors reached a fever pitch. And now, Mendes has confirmed that
   he’s in a relationship, but he’s keeping coy on the identity of his
   other half.
   “Honestly, I wanna say I wanna talk to you guys about this stuff, but
   it’s not just me in the relationship,” said Mendes, as he chatted with
   fans. “There’s another person involved and I can’t say things that I
   feel. It’s not just me deciding, you know?” In other words, Mendes is
   choosing not to kiss and tell. What a gentleman.
   Advertisement
   Still, fans are convinced his new love interest is Cabello, especially
   after the two were spotted kissing in a pool. Maybe concrete
   confirmation will come from Cabello in the form of her new album? She
   teased her new video for “What Do I Know About Love?” and, well, maybe
   she’ll tell us what she knows about love in her music, or at her
   upcoming Saturday Night Live performance on October 12.
   Until they confirm it outright, it’s still speculation — even though
   Mendes and Cabello are doing the paparazzi equivalent of basically
   singing it from the mountains. The evidence overwhelming; honestly, it
   would be a shock if isn’t wasn’t Cabello. The “Señorita” music video
   had shippers fanning themselves, as the two get very cozy and sweaty.
   She even said he loved him on Instagram. “Happy birthday to this magic
   human, I love you!!!!” wrote Cabello, along with a photo of the two. If
   it walks like a dog, barks like a dog, it’s a Shawmila lovefest.

   Whether you shield yourself behind the round Super Duper Strength, or
   prefer the more angular Deep Freeze, it's hard not to fall in love with
   Karen Walker's signature frames. They can be spotted on nearly every
   influencer's bureau (or brunch table), and on any given holiday wish
   list. The brand has been redefining statement eyewear for years — 10
   years, to be precise. How does one celebrate such a milestone? The
   Karen Walker way involves gilded sunglasses.
   To mark this special anniversary, the designer brings some of her most
   popular designs together in a golden collection aptly titled
   'Celebrate.' The brand is reissuing one frame for every year, starting
   with the Annie from 2005 and working its way to equally popular models
   like the Number One, and dressing them up in a reflective yellow hue.
   In a look book shot by Derek Ketella, Karen Walker convincingly
   suggests the mirrored sunnies, which retail for $350, are perfect for
   any holiday parties you may be attending in the next few months.
   There's cake, confetti, and enviable shades, of course — all the
   ingredients for a major case of FOMO.
   The 'Celebrate' collection is available for purchase now on Karen
   Walker's site, and soon at Barneys, Saks Fifth Avenue, and Shopbop. See
   all the frames in their gilded glory, ahead.

The Real-Life Grand Budapest Hotels You Can Actually Stay In

   Ever since I watched The Grand Budapest Hotel, I've had only one
   question on my mind. How do I get a room there? I can't be the only one
   – who wouldn't want to stay in a pink palace with its own army of
   loyal, purple-suited staff? Once you start dreaming of marble-tiled
   thermal baths and chandelier-strung lobbies, that bargain Airbnb right
   by the airport begins to lose its charm.
   Unfortunately for those desperate to sleep under M. Gustave's roof, The
   Grand Budapest Hotel doesn't actually exist. Wes Anderson took over an
   abandoned shopping centre in Germany for the location of the film, with
   all sets removed at the end of the shoot. Even the signature pink
   frontage was only a set piece.
   But don't despair! From Havana to Prague to London, there are hotels
   all over the world which have the glamour, charm and aesthetic of our
   favourite fictional abode. From pink palaces to art nouveau arches to
   glass-domed walkways, we've found the perfect hotels for anyone who
   fancies bedding down with Wes Anderson (figuratively, of course).

   To some, the term “elope” still conjures images of hasty lovers
   stumbling into clandestine chapels, or frugal pairs looking to save a
   few pennies on the guest list.
   But elopements have changed.
   Today, they’ve become an intimate alternative to a traditional wedding,
   where the details matter less than the vows being exchanged. No longer
   taboo, eloping is an incredibly romantic and wild way for adventurous
   couples to profess their love in some of the most stunning destinations
   around the world. Here are some of our favorite romantic places to
   sneak away to say "I do."
   (Note: Be sure to check out the local embassy’s marriage requirements
   and restrictions before eloping in a foreign country.)

I’ve Been In A Medical Research Group Since I Was A Baby

   Emma North

   My umbilical cord is in a deep freeze somewhere in Bristol, along with
   my placenta, nail and hair clippings, baby teeth, blood, urine and
   saliva. My whole life, I’ve given biological samples and psychological
   data to a team of researchers at Bristol University. They know my
   innermost thoughts and feelings, my family history, my friendships, how
   quick my reaction times are and how well my ears, eyes, lungs and heart
   function.
   I’m part of a longitudinal medical research group and have been since
   before I was born. My mum signed me up to it when she was in a
   maternity ward in Bristol, about to give birth to me. It was January
   1992 when she noticed a woman walking around with a clipboard, talking
   to expectant mothers. The woman wasn’t dressed like a midwife or a
   doctor, she was a medical research study recruiter. She approached each
   mother-to-be and explained that she was from ALSPAC – Avon Longitudinal
   Study of Parents and Children (also known as Children of the '90s) – a
   birth cohort study looking at the health of children, for scientific
   research. I’m 27 now and still part of the same study.

   When I tell people this fact about myself, the general assumption is
   that I am a human ‘test monkey’, that I voluntarily nominate myself for
   unsafe clinical trials or that I’m injected with new, potentially
   dangerous treatments and receive financial gain from it. Their reaction
   is a look of worry and scepticism, then inevitable curiosity.
   I started this journey completely oblivious; I was a newborn, after
   all. I’ve since asked my mum why she signed me up. Wasn’t it weird that
   a stranger was walking around a hospital asking after unborn children,
   and did she know what the study would involve? Here's what my mum says:
   “I saw the lady talking to other people. I was curious and actually
   quite pleased when she came to talk to me because I got to find out
   what she was doing. It was a bit odd I suppose, but I didn’t mind as it
   was made very clear that I could back out at any time and it was for
   invaluable research purposes.
   “I knew we would only be in Bristol for a short time so I thought it
   would end when we moved away. I had no idea about everything we were
   going to be asked or for how long but it’s never felt like too much. I
   quite enjoyed the special attention my baby had!”
   We moved to Devon when I was 4 months old and Mum would post my medical
   samples. She’d trim my nails and hair as a baby and put the clippings
   in a pouch to be delivered to the Bristol clinic. Questionnaires came
   through the door asking about the environment I was living and growing
   in; if our house had newly painted walls and if so, what type of paint
   had my parents used; whether our carpets were new; if my parents were
   smokers; was Mum breastfeeding me. My immediate family members were
   also studied, although not quite as in depth – they’d answer questions
   about their health to provide a complete picture of my upbringing.

   The earliest memory I have of being in the study is attending an
   all-day clinic aged 7. Mum and I were welcomed by a team of volunteers,
   nurses and study professionals. I was brought into a room to give
   blood. I remember the visceral feeling of hunger beforehand – I wasn’t
   allowed to eat anything in order to give a fasted blood sample – and
   the sheer joy of helping myself to the breakfast buffet afterwards. I
   was never in pain, they used numbing cream on my arm and distracted me
   with cartoons on TV. I was never uncomfortable or forced into anything,
   and was constantly reassured that I didn’t have to do anything I didn’t
   want to. I was happy to help, although maybe not fully understanding
   what I was doing at the time. We’d be there from 10am to 5pm and Mum
   would wait for me or come to the sessions when she could – she wasn't
   allowed into the psychological tests or questions about family members
   and my relationships in case her presence altered my responses.
   As I’ve grown older, the questions I’ve been asked have changed and
   become more sensitive. As a teenager I was asked if I had ever been
   touched by a family member in a way that made me feel uncomfortable.
   Had I ever used class A drugs or had thoughts or intentions of suicide?
   I always answered truthfully. Now that my growth has slowed, time
   between clinics has increased; I attend around once every two years.
   The way in which we are treated has grown with us, too. We’re thanked
   and incentives have moved from Disney stickers to shopping vouchers,
   and our transport costs are always reimbursed. The organisation gives
   study participants official letters to ask for a paid/authorised day
   off in the name of medical research, which is useful now that I’m
   working full time.

   The range of tests I have undertaken for ALSPAC is extensive and the
   same tests are often repeated for age comparison. I’ve had my heart and
   carotid artery scanned, allergies determined, bone density measured, my
   grip strength, lung function, balance, recall, speech and memory put
   through their paces. It’s an incredible insight into your own health.
   The study found that I was asthmatic, that my blood sugar was once too
   high and that I had scoliosis; significant health finds were always
   promptly communicated to my GP and I was advised to come in and speak
   to my doctor. The study also revealed why I’m so sensitive to loud
   noise. I can hear at -5 decibels, which is quieter than a snowflake
   falling to the ground – a fact, ironically, that I like to shout about.
   Luckily, I haven’t been diagnosed with anything serious but I am
   grateful for the opportunity to find out before most people probably
   could.
   In the 21st century, data breaches and misuse of personal information
   is a hot topic. I’m aware that this study has huge quantities of data
   on me but I also know that it’s stored under a unique number assigned
   to me, rather than my name. Has it ever crossed my mind that the study
   could use my DNA in a way I’m unaware of? Of course. Have my siblings
   ever joked that I could be cloned very easily? Yes, and I always
   respond: “Don’t come crying to me when you need my stem cells!” All the
   information this study has collected on me is confidential and
   consensual and I trust that it will be used only for scientific
   research. That mothers should put their babies to sleep on their backs
   to prevent cot death and that peanut allergies can result from peanut
   oil in baby products were both researched and discovered by ALSPAC.
   Information like this saves lives and I’m proud to say that I’m part of
   it.

   The study will keep going as long as funding is available. It's rare to
   have a tri-generational study and the original participant group of
   more than 14,000 people, to which I belong, are now having their own
   children and ALSPAC has started to recruit the Children of the Children
   of the ‘90s.
   I’d like to meet the founder of ALSPAC, Professor Jean Golding, to
   thank her for including me, for the 2000th academic research paper the
   study has released this year and for creating the most detailed study
   of its kind in the world. In the meantime, I have another clinic to
   attend next month so I’m off to Bristol again. Far from feeling like a
   test monkey, I feel lucky to be part of this and one day I hope to
   enrol my children, too.
