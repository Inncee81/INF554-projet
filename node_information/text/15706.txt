   ONLINE COVER Stimulation Steps Forward. Current prostheses lack sensory
   feedback, which limits mobility and increases cognitive burden of leg
   amputees. This image represents a potential solution proposed by
   Petrini et al. The authors developed a leg prothesis equipped with
   real-time proprioceptive feedback (sense of body position and movement)
   delivered through nerve stimulation. Testing the neuroprosthetic device
   in three transfemoral leg amputees showed that the on-demand and
   location-specific nerve stimulation improved mobility and agility,
   decreased falls, and reduced cognitive effort in performing active
   tasks. The results suggest that sensory feedback delivered via nerve
   stimulation could improve prosthetic control and quality of life for
   transfemoral leg amputees. [CREDIT: GIACOMO VALLE AND FRANCESCO
