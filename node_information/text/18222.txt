GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

   Version 2, June 1991
Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom
   to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
   intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
   software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This
   General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
   Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
   using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
   the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to
   your programs, too.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
   Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
   freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
   service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
   want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
   free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
   to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
   restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
   distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
   or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you
   have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
   code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
   (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
   distribute and/or modify the software.

   Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
   that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
   software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
   want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
   that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
   authors' reputations.

   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
   We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
   individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
   proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent
   must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
   modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

   0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
   notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
   under the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below,
   refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
   means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
   that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
   either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
   language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
   the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".

   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
   covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
   the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
   covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
   (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
   is true depends on what the Program does.

   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
   code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
   and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
   and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
   this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
   recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the
   Program.

   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
   you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
   it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
   such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
   that you also meet all of these conditions:

          a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

          b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that
          in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or
          any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all
          third parties under the terms of this License.

          c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
          when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
          interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
          announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
          notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you
          provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program
          under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy
          of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is
          interactive but does not normally print such an announcement,
          your work based on the Program is not required to print an
          announcement.)

   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
   identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
   and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
   themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
   sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
   distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
   on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
   this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
   entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
   it.

   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
   your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
   exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
   collective works based on the Program.

   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
   with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
   storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
   scope of this License.

   3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
   under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
   Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

          a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
          source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
          Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software
          interchange; or,

          b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
          years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
          cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
          machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
          distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
          medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

          c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the
          offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative
          is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
          received the program in object code or executable form with such
          an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

   The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
   making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source
   code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
   associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
   compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
   exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that
   is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the
   major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system
   on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
   the executable.

   If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
   to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to
   copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the
   source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the
   source along with the object code.

   4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
   except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
   to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
   automatically terminate your rights under this License. However,
   parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
   License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties
   remain in full compliance.

   5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
   signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
   distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
   prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
   modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
   Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
   all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
   Program or works based on it.

   6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
   Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
   original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
   these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
   on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
   responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

   7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
   infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
   conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
   otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
   excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot
   distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
   License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
   may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license
   would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all
   those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the
   only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
   entirely from distribution of the Program.

   If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
   any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
   apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
   circumstances.

   It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
   patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
   such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
   integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
   implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous
   contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
   system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up
   to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
   software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
   choice.

   This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
   be a consequence of the rest of this License.

   8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
   certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
   original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
   add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
   countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
   not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
   limitation as if written in the body of this License.

   9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
   of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will
   be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail
   to address new problems or concerns.

   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
   specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
   later version", you have the option of following the terms and
   conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
   the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
   number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by
   the Free Software Foundation.

   10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
   programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
   author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
   Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
   sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
   two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
   software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

   NO WARRANTY

   11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
   WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
   EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
   OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
   EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
   WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
   ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
   YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
   NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

   12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
   WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
   AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
   FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
   CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
   PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
   RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
   FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF
   SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
   DAMAGES.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
   possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
   free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
   terms.

   To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
   attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
   the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
   "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.
Copyright (C) yyyy  name of author

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2
of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA.

   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
   mail.

   If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
   when it starts in an interactive mode:
Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
type `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome
to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'
for details.

   The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
   appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the
   commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show
   c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your
   program.

   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
   school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
   necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright
interest in the program `Gnomovision'
(which makes passes at compilers) written
by James Hacker.

signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989
Ty Coon, President of Vice

   This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
   into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you
   may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
   with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser
   General Public License instead of this License.

   GNU is the only operating system developed specifically to give its
   users freedom. What is GNU, and what freedom is at stake?

What is GNU?

   GNU is an operating system that is free software—that is, it respects
   users' freedom. The GNU operating system consists of GNU packages
   (programs specifically released by the GNU Project) as well as free
   software released by third parties. The development of GNU made it
   possible to use a computer without software that would trample your
   freedom.

   We recommend installable versions of GNU (more precisely, GNU/Linux
   distributions) which are entirely free software. More about GNU below.

What is the Free Software Movement?

   The free software movement campaigns to win for the users of computing
   the freedom that comes from free software. Free software puts its users
   in control of their own computing. Nonfree software puts its users
   under the power of the software's developer. See the video explanation.

What is Free Software?

   Free software means the users have the freedom to run, copy,
   distribute, study, change and improve the software.

   Free software is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the
   concept, you should think of “free” as in “free speech”, not as in
   “free beer”.

   More precisely, free software means users of a program have the four
   essential freedoms:
     * The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose
       (freedom 0).
     * The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it
       does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source
       code is a precondition for this.
     * The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom
       2).
     * The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to
       others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community
       a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is
       a precondition for this.

   Developments in technology and network use have made these freedoms
   even more important now than they were in 1983.

   Nowadays the free software movement goes far beyond developing the GNU
   system. See the Free Software Foundation's web site for more about what
   we do, and a list of ways you can help.

More about GNU

   GNU is a Unix-like operating system. That means it is a collection of
   many programs: applications, libraries, developer tools, even games.
   The development of GNU, started in January 1984, is known as the GNU
   Project. Many of the programs in GNU are released under the auspices of
   the GNU Project; those we call GNU packages.

   The name “GNU” is a recursive acronym for “GNU's Not Unix.” “GNU” is
   pronounced g'noo, as one syllable, like saying “grew” but replacing the
   r with n.

   The program in a Unix-like system that allocates machine resources and
   talks to the hardware is called the “kernel”. GNU is typically used
   with a kernel called Linux. This combination is the GNU/Linux operating
   system. GNU/Linux is used by millions, though many call it “Linux” by
   mistake.

   GNU's own kernel, The Hurd, was started in 1990 (before Linux was
   started). Volunteers continue developing the Hurd because it is an
   interesting technical project.

   GNU is the only operating system developed specifically to give its
   users freedom. What is GNU, and what freedom is at stake?

What is GNU?

   GNU is an operating system that is free software—that is, it respects
   users' freedom. The GNU operating system consists of GNU packages
   (programs specifically released by the GNU Project) as well as free
   software released by third parties. The development of GNU made it
   possible to use a computer without software that would trample your
   freedom.

   We recommend installable versions of GNU (more precisely, GNU/Linux
   distributions) which are entirely free software. More about GNU below.

What is the Free Software Movement?

   The free software movement campaigns to win for the users of computing
   the freedom that comes from free software. Free software puts its users
   in control of their own computing. Nonfree software puts its users
   under the power of the software's developer. See the video explanation.

What is Free Software?

   Free software means the users have the freedom to run, copy,
   distribute, study, change and improve the software.

   Free software is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the
   concept, you should think of “free” as in “free speech”, not as in
   “free beer”.

   More precisely, free software means users of a program have the four
   essential freedoms:
     * The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose
       (freedom 0).
     * The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it
       does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source
       code is a precondition for this.
     * The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom
       2).
     * The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to
       others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community
       a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is
       a precondition for this.

   Developments in technology and network use have made these freedoms
   even more important now than they were in 1983.

   Nowadays the free software movement goes far beyond developing the GNU
   system. See the Free Software Foundation's web site for more about what
   we do, and a list of ways you can help.

More about GNU

   GNU is a Unix-like operating system. That means it is a collection of
   many programs: applications, libraries, developer tools, even games.
   The development of GNU, started in January 1984, is known as the GNU
   Project. Many of the programs in GNU are released under the auspices of
   the GNU Project; those we call GNU packages.

   The name “GNU” is a recursive acronym for “GNU's Not Unix.” “GNU” is
   pronounced g'noo, as one syllable, like saying “grew” but replacing the
   r with n.

   The program in a Unix-like system that allocates machine resources and
   talks to the hardware is called the “kernel”. GNU is typically used
   with a kernel called Linux. This combination is the GNU/Linux operating
   system. GNU/Linux is used by millions, though many call it “Linux” by
   mistake.

   GNU's own kernel, The Hurd, was started in 1990 (before Linux was
   started). Volunteers continue developing the Hurd because it is an
   interesting technical project.

   GNU ist das einzige eigens dafür entwickelte Betriebssystem seinen
   Nutzern Freiheit zu geben. Was ist GNU und welche Freiheit steht auf
   dem Spiel?

Was ist GNU?

   GNU ist ein Betriebssystem, das Freie Software ist ‑ d. h. es
   respektiert die Freiheit der Nutzer. Das GNU-Betriebssystem besteht aus
   GNU-Paketen (Programme, die speziell vom GNU-Projekt freigegeben
   wurden) sowie von Dritten freigegebene Freie Software. Die Entwicklung
   von GNU ermöglichte es einen Rechner ohne Software benutzen zu können,
   die Ihre Freiheit mit Füßen treten würde.

   Wir empfehlen installierbare Varianten von GNU (genauer
   GNU/Linux-Verteilungen), die ganz und gar freie Software sind. Mehr

Was ist die Freie-Software-Bewegung?

   The free software movement campaigns to win for the users of computing
   the freedom that comes from free software. Free software puts its users
   in control of their own computing. Nonfree software puts its users
   under the power of the software's developer. See the video explanation.

Was ist Freie Software?

   Freie Software bedeutet, dass Nutzer [INS: uneingeschränkt :INS] die
   Freiheit besitzen, Software ausführen, vervielfältigen, vertreiben
   untersuchen, ändern und verbessern zu können.

   Freie Software ist eine Frage der Freiheit, nicht des Preises. Um das
   Konzept frei zu verstehen, sollte an Redefreiheit gedacht werden, nicht
   an Freibier.

   Genauer gesagt bedeutet Freie Software, dass Nutzer eines Programms
   vier wesentliche Freiheiten besitzen:

   Die Freiheit,
     * das Programm für jeglichen Zweck auszuführen (Freiheit 0).
     * The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it
       does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source
       code is a precondition for this.
     * The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom
       2).
     * The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to
       others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community
       a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is
       a precondition for this.

   Technologische Entwicklungen und die Nutzung von Rechnernetzen haben
   diese Freiheiten nun sogar noch wichtiger gemacht, als sie bereits 1983
   waren.

   Heute geht die Freie-Software-Bewegung weit über die Entwicklung des
   GNU-Systems hinaus. Siehe auch die Internetpräsenz der Free Software
   Foundation, um mehr über uns und was wir tun und über Möglichkeiten,
   wie man mithelfen kann, zu erfahren.

Mehr über GNU

   GNU ist ein unixoides Betriebssystem. Das bedeutet, dass es eine
   Zusammenstellung aus vielerlei Programmen ist: Anwendungen,
   Bibliotheken, Extras für Entwickler, sogar Spielen. Die Entwicklung von
   GNU begann im Januar 1984 und ist als das GNU-Projekt bekannt. Viele
   der in GNU enthaltenen Programme sind unter der Schirmherrschaft des
   GNU-Projekts freigegeben; diese nennen wir GNU-Pakete.

   Der Name GNU ist ein rekursives Akronym von GNU’s Not Unix (‚GNU ist
   nicht Unix‘) und wird [ˈgnuː] ausgesprochen.

   Das Programm in einem unixoiden System, was Rechnerressourcen zuteilt
   und die Hardware anspricht, wird als Betriebssystemkern bezeichnet. GNU
   wird häufig mit einem Systemkern namens Linux genutzt. [INS: Die :INS]
   Kombination [INS: des GNU-Systems mit dem Linux-Kern :INS] ist das
   GNU/Linux-Betriebssystem. GNU/Linux wird von Millionen genutzt, obwohl
   es viele fälschlicherweise „Linux“ nennen.

   Die Entwicklung von GNUs eigenem Kern, Hurd, begann (noch vor Linux) im
   Jahre 1990. Da Hurd ein interessantes technisches Projekt ist, wird er
   nach wie vor von engagierten Freiwilligen weiterentwickelt.
