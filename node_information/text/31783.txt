Exposición en la Biblioteca Musical de Madrid

   La exposición, comisariada por Cristina Bordas, abre el 15 de noviembre
   y dura hasta abril. En conversaciones con Cristina y la directora de la
   biblioteca Inmaculada Seldas me he dado cuenta que tengo que sacar un
   día pronto para ir a Madrid a ver todo lo que van a exponer. Pulsa aquí
   para más detalles.

Adiós a un maestro

   Posted on 06/11/2019 by johnray

   Hoy es un día triste para la luthería. José Ángel Chacón Tenllado
   falleció esta madrugada con 85 años plenamente aprovechados y dejando
   atrás una obra compuesto por multitúd de instrumentos de cuerda,
   artesanos formados en la luthería y una “Escuela Malagueña de Luthería”
   que es tanto una tradición como una realidad donde los alumnos aprenden
   ahora con el heredero José Ángel Chacón Escobar. Aunque yo hice mi
   primer instrumento aquí en Granada con cuatro consejos de Antonio Marín
   y Jonathan Hinves, mi primera enseñanza fue en Málaga con José Ángel.
   Aprendí muchísimo sobre la madera, las herramientas, historia y la
   cultura músical. También terminé allí la guitarra que aún conservo y
   toco. Hoy tendríamos que honrar la visión de José Ángel, una visión de
   una escuela de luthería con fondos públicos y un reconocimiento de este
   oficio tan importante. Hizo grandes pasos hacía una escuela oficial
   pero hay trabajo por hacer todavía.

   Today is a sad day for those of us who live by the chisel and the
   plane. José Ángel Chacón Tenllado passed away early this morning at the
   age of 85 having lived a full life and leaving behind a legacy that any
   luthier would be proud of. He founded the “Escuela Malagueña de
   Luthería”, taught many a builder, and built hundreds of stringed
   instruments. His son José Ángel Chacón Escobar carries on the tradition
   and continues to teach students at the family workshop. Although I
   built my first instrument here in Granada with a few consultations with
   Antonio Marín and Jonathan Hinves, the first person to take an interest
   in teaching me was José Ángel in Málaga. I learned so much about wood,
   tools, history and musical culture. I also built my first guitar and I
   still have it and play it.

   In the video above you can see that he was named Maestro Artesano by
   the regional government (the first luthier to have that honor), he
   earned the medalla de plata al mérito de las bellas artes from the
   Ministry of Culture. He also wrote two books on the subject of
   lutherie. He was a man with a vision and that vision was of an official
   school of lutherie and public support for it. He achieved great things
   both in Málaga and in Gelves, Sevilla but Spanish governments still
   refuse to value lutherie in the way it is valued all over the world.

First in a series

   Posted on 03/11/2019 by johnray

   I was perusing my collection of guitar books and realised that while
   some of you might have a similar collection there are certainly those
   among you who will be interested in hearing some of the anecdotes found
   in those books. I’m starting with a book by Julia Crowe which I loved.
   It is full of stories from guitarists from all “walks” of music. The
   title is “My First Guitar” and is based on interviews with a plethora
   of guitarists, guitar-makers and technicians. The books makes for a
   great read even if your heros are not guitar heros; mine are. Here is
   something from Juan Martin’s story on page 107:

     When I was seventeen, I went to Madrid and mixed up with the great
     players in the capital. I used to listen to a record of the great
     flamenco guitarist Niño Ricardo, and would do this by slowing down
     the old 33 rpm LP to the speed of 16, making the music one octave
     lower. This way, I could more or less work out what I was hearing.
     So when I traveled to Madrid, I went to the Conde Hermanos shop with
     the hope of finding a better guitar than the Conde I had or at least
     to see if they could make it better for me. I played this Ricardo
     material and there was this old man in the shop, listening. He said
     to to me, gruffly, “¿Tu quien eres?” (“Who are you?”). I said “Juan
     Martin.” “¿De donde ha aprendido esto?” (“Where did you learn
     this?”). I told him I learned it from Niño Ricardo.          “Yo soy
     el Ricardo!” he growled.

   Of course he goes on to tell how he learned from and drank wine with
   Niño Ricardo and went on to meet other guitar greats. The book is
   inspiring and funny and well worth tracking down. The ebook version is
   readily available and you can contact Julia for a copy on her blog at
   this link.
