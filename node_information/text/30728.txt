The best support I have ever had

   The best support I have ever had. Very quick to respond, usually in a

Great to have live people to help

   First time working with anything other than WP preloaded themes. I am a
   very basic beginner, and self taught so it is wonderful to have support
   at hand as I usually sit all alone and struggle at odd hours of day
   feeling really dumb. The forums are good because there's a range of
   people on there too and usually asking my same questions, and I imagine
   they will even get better as number of users increases. All in all
   using this has cut my trial and error time before getting up and
   running waaay shorter. I love how they make recommendations for plugins
   and then provide those plugins so I don't have to go searching around
   the world for something that integrates. Really nice to have live
   people to work with!

   Not only are their products worth every penny, their customer service

eMail Opt-In And Lead Generation Plugin For WordPress

Grow Your Following!

Gain More Email Subscribers with BLOOM, an Email Opt-In Plugin for WordPress.

   Premade Layouts

Convert

Convert Visitors Into Loyal Followers

   Bloom gives you all the tools you need to turn your website's visitors
   into loyal followers and customers. Not only is Bloom going to convert
   extremely well, it's going to look great doing it.
   More Email Subscribers

More Email Subscribers

   Email marketing is extremely powerful. In fact, we see 20X the
   engagement from emails than we do from posts to our social media
   profiles.
   Targeted Content

Highly Targeted Content

   Bloom lets you target or exclude specific posts and pages and display
   unique forms with unique offers based on visitor location and
   interaction.
   Design Options

Elegant Design Options

   We have built over 100 amazing templates, each of which can be
   completely customized using Bloom's extensive design settings.

Display

Pick From 6 Different Display Types

Automatic Opt-In Pop-Up

   Bloom lets you create automatic opt-in pop-ups that can be triggered by
   timed delays, when a user reaches the bottom of a post or page, or even
   after they comment or purchase. This is an extremely effective way to
   generate and convert leads.
   Live Preview
   Automatic Opt-In Pop-Up

Automatic Opt-In Fly-Ins

   Similar to triggered pop-ups, fly-ins are another great way to grab
   your readers' attention. Again, these can be triggered by user
   interaction such as timed delays or at the end of a page.
   Live Preview
   Automatic Opt-In Fly-In

In-line Opt-In Forms

   Sometimes there is need for a more location specific approach than you
   can get with a global pop-up or fly-in. That's where inline opt-in
   forms come in. Simply configure your form, generate its shortcode, and
   place it inside the WordPress post editor.
   Live Preview
   Inline Opt-In Form

Below Content Opt-In Forms

   Perfect for blog posts and content heavy pages, Bloom allows you to
   automatically place opt-in forms below your post or page content,
   capturing the attention of your most engaged readers without upsetting
   their reading experience.
   Live Preview
   Below Content Opt-In Form

Widget Area Opt-In Forms

   Sidebars and footers are great places to add an opt-in box. Bloom makes
   it easy to add opt-ins to any widget-ready area using the Bloom widget.
   Create as many widgets as you like and add them to any widget-ready
   area on your website.
   Learn More
   Widget Area Opt-In Form

Require Opt-In To Unlock Content

   Requiring users to subscribe to your lists before gaining access to
   premium content is a great way to increase your subscriber count. Bloom
   can act as a pay-wall between your free resources and your visitors,
   quickly turning traffic into loyal followers.
   Live Preview
   Opt-In to Unlock Content

Trigger!

Automatic Pop-Up & Fly-In Triggers

   Not only do different websites, pages, and posts have different opt-in
   form needs, but sometimes you also want to direct specific forms and
   offers based on specific user interaction. The triggers below allow you
   to add this extra level of specificity to hone in on your audience and
   gain even higher conversion rates.

Timed Delay

   Choose a timed delay for your pop-ups and fly-ins so that they trigger
   after your readers have been on a page for a specific duration of time.

Bottom of Post

   Let Bloom auto detect when your readers reach the bottom of a post or
   page and give your readers a friendly reminder to opt-in.

After Scrolling

   Use this trigger to display your opt-in forms only after visitors
   scroll a defined percentage of the way down your page.

After Commenting

   Displaying opt-in forms to readers after commenting on a post or page
   is a sure way to target visitors who are clearly engaged with your
   content.

After Purchasing

   Offer updates on future products and promotions by triggering an opt-in
   form for purchasing visitors right after the checkout process.

After Inactivity

   If a user is inactive on your page for too long, Bloom can be triggered
   to re-catch your visitor's attention with a pop-up or fly-in.

Integrate

19 Email Marketing Integrations

   Bloom gives you the power to display opt-in forms using integrations of
   the most popular email marketing systems available. Bloom seamlessly
   obtains information about all of your lists and subscriber counts.
   Bloom Email Marketing Integrations

Design & Customize

Start From Any of 100+ Pre-made Templates Or Customize Your Own!

   Well-designed opt-in forms that look like they belong specifically to
   your website are key to creating trust. Bloom comes with a ton of
   different design settings, allowing you to adjust just about every
   aspect of your opt-in form.

   Targeted Display

Select from 3 Opt-In Form Orientations

   Depending on your opt-in's location and type, you may want to place
   your form below or on the side of your opt-in. Bloom gives you 3
   orientations to choose from: bottom, left, or right.
   Custom Border and Edge Styles

Customized Borders & Edges

   Select from Bloom's different border styles and choose which edges to
   apply them too. You can also define an edge style that separates your
   opt-in's content from its form fields.
   Custom Border and Edge Styles

Image Orientation Options

   You can add any image to your opt-in while also having the options to
   display it to the left, the right, above or below your opt-in's text
   content.
   Custom Border and Edge Styles

Unlimited Color Options

   In addition to border, edge, form field, and text content options, you
   also have full control over the colors that define these elements.
   Enjoy unlimited color options for all the elements within your opt-in
   forms.
   Custom Border and Edge Styles

Fully Responsive

   We know that your opt-in forms need to be readable and accessible from
   all devices, allowing visitors to opt-in no matter how they are viewing
   your site. Blooms opt-in forms and dashboard are fully responsive and
   look great all the way down to even the smallest mobile devices and
   highest resolution screens.
   Responsive Design

Target

Highly Targeted Display Settings

   Display settings are used to control where on your website your opt-in
   will appear, as well as when it will appear. You can choose to display
   your opt-in on your entire site, or you can choose to display you
   opt-in on individual posts or post types. Create unlimited opt-in forms
   and tailor them to specific pages and specific visitors to increase
   your conversion rates.

   Targeted Display

Automatic Fly-In and Pop-Up Triggers

   If you are creating a pop-up or fly-in you need to have full control
   over what triggers this automation. Bloom lets you trigger your opt-ins
   based on a timed delay, at the bottom of a post or page, after
   scrolling, after commenting, after purchasing, and/or after the user is
   inactive on your page for a defined amount of time.
   Optin Triggers

Target Specific Post Types and Categories

   Bloom's display settings give you global options for displaying your
   opt-in on selected post and page types, along with specific categories
   within them.
   Display Targeting

Refine on a Per Post or Page Level

   For an extra level of display targeting, you can even specify specific
   pages and posts to either display or not display an opt-in on.
   Display Targeting

Manage

The Bloom Dashboard

   Setting up and managing your Bloom settings is anything but
   complicated. We've created a custom panel in the WordPress dashboard
   for easy and intuitive access to your Bloom accounts, lists, opt-ins,
   conversion rates, and data.
   Bloom Dashboard

Increase Conversions With A/B Testing

   Split testing lets you compare the performance of multiple variations
   of the same opt-in form to help you figure out which one is the most
   effective. These different variations will be shown to different
   visitors, and their conversion rates will be compared to each other so
   you can see which one is the highest performing variation.
   Slplit Testing

Add, Modify, and Track Accounts

   You can add an unlimited number of email marketing accounts and Bloom
   will organize your accounts by provider and also aggregate the lists
   and subscriber counts that are associated with those accounts. When you
   are building opt-in forms you can then choose from any of these lists,
   or even setup an account on the fly.
   Email Optin Account Management

Conversion and Email List Statistics

   It is almost impossible to refine and improve the way you are targeting
   your visitors without actionable insights around when, where, and how
   your opt-ins are converting the best. That's why we've created a robust
   statistics dashboard to give you a real-time overview of Bloom's
   performance.
   Social Sharing and Following Statistics

Import and Export Bloom Data

   Bloom lets you easily import and export its data from one site to
   another. In addition to migration, this is also a great way to backup
   your Bloom settings and data on a regular basis.

Social Sharing

Over 20 Social Networks to Choose From

   Social Media is the lifeblood that keeps the internet glowing. Social
   Sharing lets you harness that activity and use it as a positive force
   for your business. Choose from more than 20 social sharing networks to
   display on your website to create a custom collection of sharing
   options for your visitors.
   Monarch Sharing Networks

Add Sharing Buttons in 5 Different Locations

   Different websites, pages, and posts have different social sharing
   needs. That's why we've included a large selection of locations you can
   choose to place sharing buttons.

Floating Sidebar

   A floating sidebar is a very common, effective, and sleek way to add
   social sharing icons to any page on your website. We've even included
   unique hover styles for the vertical and browser edge orientation of a
   social sidebar.

Above & or Below Content

   Perfect for blog posts and content heavy pages, Monarch allows you to
   place sharing buttons either above the content area, below the content
   area, or in both locations.

   Inline Share Icons

On Images & Videos

   Media is arguably the most shared content on the web and Monarch makes
   media sharing even easier. When users hover over media elements within
   your content social sharing buttons fade in for quick and easy sharing.

Automatic Pop-Ups

   Monarch lets you create automatic sharing pop-ups that can be triggered
   by timed delays, such as when a user reaches the bottom of a post or
   page and even upon leaving a page. These are incredibly effective.

   Popup Share Icons

Automatic Fly-ins

   Similar to triggered pop-ups, fly-ins are another great way to grab
   your readers' attention when they are most engaged. These can also be
   triggered by time delays, page location, or when the user's mouse is
   leaving the page.

   Flyin Share Icons

Pop & Fly!

6 Automatic Pop-Up & Fly-In Triggers

   Pop-ups and Fly-ins can be triggered by unique user interactions. This
   allows you to capture your visitors' attention when they are most
   engaged or when they are in danger of leaving your page.

Timed Delay

   Choose a timed delay for your pop-ups and fly-ins so that they trigger
   after your readers have been on a page for a specific duration of time.

Bottom of Post

   Let Monarch auto detect when your readers reach the bottom of a post or
   page and give your readers a friendly reminder to opt-in.

After Commenting

   Displaying opt-in forms to readers after commenting on a post or page
   is a sure way to target visitors who are clearly engaged with your
   content.

Upon % Scroll

   Use this trigger to display your opt-in forms only after a visitor
   scrolls a defined percentage of the way down your page.

After Purchasing

   Offer updates on future products and promotions by triggering an opt-in
   form for purchasing visitors right after the checkout process.

After Inactivity

   If a user is inactive on your page for too long, Bloom can be triggered
   to re-catch your visitor's attention with a pop-up or fly-in.

Display

Build & Display Your Social Following

   Letting your users see your social networks profiles, follow counts,
   and easily become a follower is more than important for any business or
   individual. Monarch makes all of the above possible with just a few
   easy settings.

Over 35 Social Networks to Choose From

   Monarch lets you choose from over 30 social profiles and networks. Just
   supply your profile URL's and Monarch will display the network icons
   and even dynamically pull your existing follow counts if desired.
   Monarch Follow Networks

Place Follow Buttons in any Widget Area or Display With a Shortcode

   Displaying social follow links within your content is as simple as
   generating and pasting a shortcode within your content. Placing this
   shortcode inside of a Divi Text Module is a perfect way to take
   advantage of this feature.
   Monarch Follow Display Areas

Customize

Clean, Customizable Design

   We know that implementing plugin elements into your site can appear
   tacky and out of place, so we packed Monarch full of design options for
   seamless design integration.

Choose Button Shapes, Colors, & Hover Effects

   Monarch offers 3 button shapes, 5 sidebar button hover effects, and 4
   inline button hover effects. Combining these appearance options allows
   you to fit your social icons perfectly into the design of your theme.
   Monarch Design Styles

Display Network Names & Social Counts

   For a more robust social link, you can display the network names and or
   the individual or total share or follow counts. No matter what
   information you choose to display, your social links will look great.
   Monarch Design Content

Pick Your Icon Orientation

   Being able to display the social network icon above or to the left of
   your share counts, follow counts and/or network name doubles the design
   opportunities available to you. Whether you are displaying your icons
   in a more vertical or horizontal orientation, this option lets you take
   advantage of the space.
   Monarch Design Orientation

Use Native Network Colors or Pick Your Own!

   By default, the button colors will be that of the native colors of each
   social network. For a more custom appearance, you can pick custom
   colors for the button and icon colors for both before and on hover.
   Monarch Design Color

Mobile Friendly

   We know that your opt-in forms need to be readable and accessible from
   all devices, allowing visitors to opt-in no matter how they are viewing
   your site. Monarch's opt-in forms and dashboard are fully responsive
   and look great all the way down to even the smallest mobile devices and
   highest resolution screens.
   Monarch Resposive

Manage

The Monarch Dashboard

   Setting up and managing your Monarch settings is anything but
   complicated. We've created a custom panel in the WordPress dashboard
   for easy and intuitive access to your Monarch settings, stats, and
   data.
   Monarch Dashboard

Configure All of Your Display Settings

   In addition to basic appearance options Monarch also lets you refine
   your display settings to fit your every need. Lazy loading animations,
   share count display minimums, and column structures are just a few of
   the things you can control.
   Monarch Display Settings

Check Your Statistics

   An overview of your Monarch statistics can be accessed at any time via
   the dashboard. Just click the stats icon in the upper right for
   statistics around your shares, follows, and likes.

Import and Export Monarch Data

   If you have multiple websites that you want to display similar Monarch
   configurations on, you can quickly and easily import and export Monarch
   settings from one WordPress site to another.

The best support I have ever had

   The best support I have ever had. Very quick to respond, usually in a
   couple of hours and always get a fix within a few attempts. Would
   recommend them highly.

Great to have live people to help

   First time working with anything other than WP preloaded themes. I am a
   very basic beginner, and self taught so it is wonderful to have support
   at hand as I usually sit all alone and struggle at odd hours of day
   feeling really dumb. The forums are good because there's a range of
   people on there too and usually asking my same questions, and I imagine
   they will even get better as number of users increases. All in all
   using this has cut my trial and error time before getting up and
   running waaay shorter. I love how they make recommendations for plugins
   and then provide those plugins so I don't have to go searching around
   the world for something that integrates. Really nice to have live
   people to work with!

Elegant Themes Support ROCKS!

   I own a website, but I am not a developer and know nothing about
   coding. Whenever I have a Divi update or customization need, Elegant
   Themes support always helps me and resolves my issues. I have worked
   with some of the support techs for so long that we feel like we know
   each other.

Worth every penny

   Not only are their products worth every penny, their customer service
   is OUTSTANDING! There was a small technical issue with my order
   (bonuses went to spam) and they honored & took accountability for their
   part in it. Refreshing in a world of horrible customer service where
   companies put THEIR responsibility on the customer. Thank you! We are
   customers for life & will tell the world (:

   well and can't do enough, great customer service experience!
