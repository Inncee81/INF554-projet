   Apple Cinnamon Yogurt Pancakes
   Apple Cinnamon Yogurt Pancakes
   about a week ago

   Apple picking season has commenced. If you happen to have some freshly
   picked apples or snagged some seasonal apples from the farmers market,
   you may be looking for some ways to utilize your bounty. Enter the
   apple cinnamon yogurt pancakes - also full of protein and fiber. These
   pancakes come together easily and are just as tasty when made in
   advance. Just reheat or eat cold, and you have a quick and delicious
   back-to-school breakfast that is perfect for those busy frenetic
   mornings. If you really want to go the extra mile, consider topping the
   pancakes with an extra dollop of yogurt and some sautéd cinnamon
   apples. You or your back-to-schooler will be very grateful.
   pumpkin and hemp seed granola
   pumpkin and hemp seed granola
   about 3 weeks ago

   Granola is one of those foods that can start out with healthy
   intensions and then turn into a sugar loaded faux healthy meal or
   snack. The foundation is typically a wholesome one, but then it becomes
   adulterated with loads of sugar, oil, possibly some chocolate chips,
   and sugar coated dried fruit. This recipe for a healthy, "feel good"
   pumpkin and hemp seed granola, which is loaded with seeds, spices, some
   maple syrup, and fiber will leave you satisfied and satiated without
   the post sugar high slump.

   cold sesame tofu with rice noodles
   cold sesame tofu with rice noodles
   about a month ago

   There is a Cold Sesame Chicken recipe from the New York Times that I
   have gone back to quite a few times this summer. It is delicious, super
   simple, and perfect for make ahead meals. To adapt the recipe for a
   plant-forward crowd, I decided to swap in tofu for the main and serve
   it over brown rice noodles with crunchy marinated cucumbers, peanuts,
   and cilantro, resulting in a refreshing and easy summer meal.
