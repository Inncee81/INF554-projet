   We all have that one person we immediately connect with; someone who
   you know will always be part of your life. The person you can easily
   talk to, even though it has been months if not years since you last saw
   one another. For me, Eman Al Nafjan is such a person; someone I am
   proud of, who inspires me and makes me laugh.

   We met in 2010 while I was living in Saudi Arabia. Eman introduced me
   to Saudi culture and cuisine, and taught me useful Arabic phrases. She
   took me around the magical souks in Riyadh.

   We used to spend hours discussing all aspects of life. At that time,
   she was working as an English teacher at a university while completing
   her PhD in linguistics. Since 2010, our tradition has been to meet once
   a year to enjoy new places, visit museums and catch up. We are both
   morning people, but Eman is up earlier than most. Even on holiday, I
   would often find her sitting at a table, very early in the morning,
   with a cup of strong coffee in one hand and a newspaper in the other.

     I am writing this because I want the world to know who Eman Al
     Nafjan is. A kind, beautiful soul who has been wrongfully detained.
     The seriousness of the baseless allegations and the media campaign
     against her is worrying.

   TKI
   A friend of Eman Al Nafjan

   Last May, Eman was detained by Saudi authorities along with Loujain
   al-Hathloul, Aziza al-Yousef, and four other women's rights activists
   for promoting social rights.

   Eman is open-minded and loves to push boundaries, no matter the risks.
   Even when she disagrees with someone, it is always possible to talk to
   her openly. She is a scholar with a thirst for knowledge and culture.
   She is the mother of four children, the eldest a teenager and the
   youngest only a toddler. She is a loving mother who puts her children
   first; caring and worrying about them like mothers do, wanting them to
   see the world and its cultures, teaching them to be good, kind people.
   She has been a source of advice and inspiration in my own motherhood.

   Once, she read a picture book to my young child, improvising a story
   about the importance of sharing. That is who Eman is and what she
   stands for: justice, kindness and love. Eman does not like to be apart
   from her children, especially when they are very young. That is why her
   arrest is heart-wrenching. It is distressing to know that she has been
   forcibly separated from her children for seven months, missing out on
   many important milestones for each child.

   Despite having children, she invests much of her time and energy in
   causes bigger than herself and in promoting social rights. She started
   her blog Saudiwoman.me in 2008, two years before we met. It was her
   platform to air her opinions about society. As Eman herself writes, she
   is proud of Saudi Arabia, its history and accomplishments. Her aim was
   to correct misunderstandings and talk more openly about Saudi society.
   She is a strong woman with a sharp pen, which quickly led to attention
   and requests from international media, including The Guardian, Foreign
   Policy, New York Times and others.

   I am writing this because I want the world to know who Eman Al Nafjan
   is. A kind, beautiful soul who has been wrongfully detained. The
   seriousness of the baseless allegations and the media campaign against
   her is worrying. Peaceful campaigning and freedom of speech are never a
   crime. Most worryingly is the horrible news about torture and the
   condition of many women’s rights activists in Saudi Arabia today. Their
   lives are in danger. I am concerned about Eman’s wellbeing. I think
   about her every day. Especially in the evening, when I can kiss my
   children good night, knowing Eman misses out on kissing hers.

   Eman, the world has not forgotten about you. You might be silenced, but
   we will continue to speak up for you until you are released and
   reunited with your children again.

   TKI wrote this piece anonymously in support for Amnesty International
   Norway’s campaign to free the Saudi women who have been imprisoned
   since May 2018.

   On Thursday 14 February, the European Parliament held an urgent debate
   on the situation facing women’s human rights defenders in Saudi Arabia.
   It adopted a resolution condemning the detention and torture of Saudi
   women activists.

   Amnesty International has urged EU countries to end their silence on
   Saudi Arabia’s systematic violations and to call for the immediate
   release of these brave women’s rights defenders. Find out more about
   Eman’s case here.

I'm an activist, a mother, a student and a Syrian | View

   By Amal Nasr

   My name is Amal Nasr. It means “hope in victory” in Arabic. For me,
   victory would be overcoming violence in all its forms.

   I am from Syria. I have been involved in feminism and political
   activism since the 1990s, when I worked peacefully alongside many
   Syrian men and women. We were striving to bring down the dictatorial
   regime, build a homeland of freedom, dignity and justice, and bring
   about a Syria based on human rights and the rule of law.

   We wanted a clear constitution that separated religion and politics,
   and that enshrined the separation of legislative, judicial and
   executive powers. I was also actively involved in trade unions,
   fighting for worker’s rights to be independent and free from the
   regime's political influence.

   But our revolution was transformed into an armed conflict. This is a
   war between the ruling regime, which has stolen our homeland in every
   sense of the word, and those who hijacked the revolution and sold our
   freedom to whomever was willing to pay. It is Syrian civilians who have
   paid the price for this war, with forced displacement, death and
   devastation.

   I hope that one day I, my family and all displaced Syrians will be able
   to return to our homeland freely and independently. I believe that,
   ultimately, those Syrians who lead the struggle with their pens,
   thoughts and will, are more dangerous to the regime than those who
   fight.

   In Syria I got a degree in Economics from the University of Damascus,
   and worked as an occupational health and safety trainer at the Damascus
   labour union. I am now pursuing my Ph.D. degree at the University of
   Amsterdam in the Netherlands.

   I have endured a lot due to the security situation in Syria. My
   husband, a politician, was detained on many occasions between 2012 and
   2013. I myself was arrested on 2 March 2014 by the military
   intelligence agency upon my return to the country from Geneva, where
   I’d helped launch a women’s peace initiative at the UN.

   After my arrest I was placed in a solitary confinement cell with 11
   other women, aged between 13 and 86. The cell measured 1.5 by 2 meters.
   I was interrogated on charges of terrorism before being transferred to
   Adra women’s prison. I was finally released in May 2014 but remained
   under investigation as a terrorist. This meant I was fired from my job
   and denied all my entitlements, after 20 years of work, and a travel
   ban was issued against me.

   Using irregular documents, I managed to travel to Lebanon in September
   2014. There I was able to get a visa to Switzerland, by virtue of the
   fact that I have a history of activism with some international and
   Swiss organizations. After arriving in Switzerland I applied for
   asylum, and in 2015 I was issued a residence permit as a political
   refugee.

   Through Amnesty International's help, I have been able to reunite with
   my husband in Switzerland after years of separation, at the hands of
   the Syrian regime and because of visa difficulties. But our daughter,
   our only child, had her application for reunification with us denied
   because she is over 18. She is still in Syria and I am often
   overwhelmed by fear for her safety. Our tiny family is separated by
   long distances, mountains and seas. There are thousands of Syrian women
   with similar stories.

   I try to keep hope alive wherever I go. My husband and I have opened,
   in collaboration with a Swiss organization, a school that provides free
   lessons to Syrian children in Lucerne. We teach Arabic and tell them
   about Syria before the violence. Syria is such a diverse country, in
   its landscape, history and culture. We teach these children about
   Syrian heritage, history and thought free from any political or
   religious ideology. We try to instil a sense of Syrian identity that I
   hope will one day contribute to the rebuilding of Syria.

   I have faced many hardships that I could never have predicted. I never
   imagined that I would be a refugee in another country. I do not know
   how long I will have to stay outside Syria without my only daughter.
   But I still dream of peace and freedom – we cannot overcome obstacles
   if we accept that the future will be the same as the past.

   _Amal Nasr is a Syrian feminist and activist.

   _To mark World Refugee Day, Amnesty International is calling for people
   to share the story behind the label, as part of the broader campaign
   #MyNameIsNotRefugee, proving refugees are so much more than their
   status. Find out more about Amnesty International’s I Welcome campaign.
