     * Arnaud Lallement, Guest Chef at La Vague d’Or

       On September 17, the sincerity of two passionate men blossoms in
       delightful aromas upon a four-hand dinner under the stars.

       As an introduction, Mediterranean vegetables announce a poetic and
       emotional Provence. Sea sprays and land scents blend together as a
       fragrant concerto. During these festivities celebrating friendship
       and sharing, audaciously mastered sauces are refined with a waltz
       of champagnes to the rhythm of exquisite plates. The piece ends
       with Tropezian delights, orchestrated with finesse and delicacy.

       During this gentle evening of late summer days, the savoir-faire
       and passion of Arnaud Donckele and Arnaud Lallement, the marriage
       of Provençal scents and Champagne aromas dance in seasonal circles
       with harmony. Our Ambassadeurs are at your entire disposal for any
       booking request by email at info.sttropez@chevalblanc.com or by
       phone at +33 (0)4 94 55 91 00.

     * Symphony of the Caribbean by Jean Imbert
       09/19/2019
       Symphony of the Caribbean by Jean Imbert Symphony of the Caribbean
       by Jean Imbert
       From December, Cheval Blanc St-Barth Isle de France will welcome
       Jean Imbert to present a new culinary journey at La Case
       restaurant.
       In a decor designed by Jacques Grange, La Case by Jean Imbert
       offers an ultimate moment of conviviality and discovery where local
       flavours blend with the art of living in the tropics.
       Enchanted by the barefoot rhythm of Cheval Blanc St-Barth Isle de
       France, Jean Imbert designed a menu inspired by the Caribbean to be
       discovered with generosity, elegance, joie de vivre and
       spontaneity. Spices of the region bring forth the flavours of the
       meat, while locally cultivated herbs subtly enhance each vegetable
       dish. The responsibly harvested fish, meanwhile, is enjoyed raw,
       elevated to perfection by the acidity of its dressings. Caribbean
       fruits and chocolate from the surrounding islands form the
       delectable core of the dessert menu.
       The spirit of the island extends beyond the dishes. Enjoy an
       exclusive collection of tableware designed by Jean Imbert for Dior
       and the signature location of La Case: the Flamands Beach.
       La Case is reopening more contemporary and authentic than ever.

   Cheval Blanc was born from the desire to redefine the notion of
   hospitality experiences in rare and exceptional destinations
     * Ocean
       From the beginning, Cheval Blanc has offered a new vision of the
       time spent in our Maisons carried by four fundamental values, the
       intangible prisms of our every action: exclusive privacy,
       craftsmanship, creativity and Art de Recevoir.
     * Constantly nourished by our team’s subtle sense of bold innovation
       and genuine passion, these values illustrate the LVMH Group’s
       quest  for excellence.
     * Representing the quintessence of exceptional service, the Cheval
       Blanc Maisons cultivate the elegance of movement, art of emotion
       and a sense of surprise and enchantment. With a “haute couture”
       approach, the Maisons deploy a trove of talents and imagination to
       make every unforgettable stay a warm and personal experience.
     * Deeply rooted in the brand’s core values, this emotional philosophy
       emboldens the soul of each of our Maisons, and soon in the heart of
       Paris along the banks of the Seine, with the ambition to further
       nurture our vision of Art de Recevoir..
