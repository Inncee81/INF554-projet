   Driving in Australia
   To rent a car in Australia, you must have a valid driver’s licence
   issued in the country you live in as well as piece of ID with you.
   Factor in long distances when you travel, especially in rural or remote
   areas. There are rest areas every 50 to 60 miles on highways. Extreme
   weather conditions often affect driving: be aware of flood or bushfire
   warnings when you travel. In some areas, a four-wheeled drive is
   advised.
   The national speed limit is 110 km/h on highways. There are some
   variations, including the Northern Territory which is 130 km/h. On
   two-lane roads the limit is 100 km/h, in built up areas it lowers to 50
   km/h and to 40 km/h near schools.
   There are payable tolls on highways around major cities in Australia.
   Some use a fully electronic system so you’ll need to buy an e-tag pass
   to pay. These can be bought in advance or paid online up to 3 days
   after you’ve passed through the toll.
