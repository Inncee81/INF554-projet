   Triple Force Friday

   Lucasfilm // SEPTEMBER 24, 2019

A Galaxy of Star Wars Stars Count Down to Triple Force Friday

Join Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Pedro Pascal, Gina Carano, and more for a
special first look at new Star Wars products before they hit shelves.

   Lucasfilm and stars from across the Star Wars saga will be unveiling
   the next generation of products from a galaxy far, far away — and we
   would be honored if you would join us.

   Tune into YouTube.com/StarWars on Thursday, September 26, at 11 a.m. PT
   / 2 p.m. ET for a special livestream event based at Pinewood Studios in
   London, the famed shooting location of Star Wars: The Rise of
   Skywalker. Via live and recorded vignettes, generations of Star Wars
   icons will reveal new products in advance of their roll out on Triple
   Force Friday, October 4, all inspired by a trio of the year’s biggest
   Star Wars releases:

     * Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: The highly-anticipated final
       installment of the Skywalker Saga, which hits theaters December 20
     * The Mandalorian: The first-ever Star Wars live-action series, which
       will debut in the US on November 12 exclusively on Disney+, the
       Walt Disney Company’s new streaming service
     * Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order: A brand-new action adventure game
       from Respawn, releasing November 15

   The livestream celebration will feature appearances from Daisy Ridley
   (Rey), John Boyega (Finn), Oscar Isaac (Poe), Anthony Daniels (C-3PO),
   Billy Dee Williams (Lando Calrissian), Joonas Suotamo (Chewbacca), Keri
   Russell (Zorii), Naomi Ackie (Jannah), Kelly Marie Tran (Rose), Pedro
   Pascal (The Mandalorian), Gina Carano (Cara Dune in The Mandalorian),
   and Cameron Monaghan (Cal Kestis in Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order).
   Livestream viewers also will be treated to the worldwide premiere of a
   new trailer for Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, along with other special
   surprises from across the Star Wars galaxy. Warwick Davis, a beloved
   Star Wars actor known for his role as the Ewok “Wicket” in Star Wars:
   Return of the Jedi, will serve as host during the livestream event at
   Pinewood Studios, while Anthony Carboni (The Star Wars Show) will helm
   the recorded product reveals.

   Fans can join the conversation on social using Triple #ForceFriday.

   Stay tuned to StarWars.com for more on Triple Force Friday!

Characters //

       Rey

Rey
       A scavenger toughened by life in Jakku’s harsh deserts, Rey has
       been drawn into a galaxy-spanning conflict and learned that her
       life is being shaped by the mysterious power of the Force. She
       seeks out Luke Skywalker, the lost Jedi Master, in hopes that he
       will aid the Resistance against the First Order and help her
       control her growing powers. But when that quest ends in
       disappointment, Rey must find a new way forward.

databank
       Kylo Ren

Kylo Ren
       The son of Han Solo and Leia Organa, Ben Solo was seduced by the
       dark side of the Force and renamed himself Kylo Ren, becoming the
       First Order’s champion and Supreme Leader Snoke’s student. Kylo
       killed his father and seeks to destroy his mother’s Resistance and
       the remnants of the Jedi Order. Though a servant of the dark side,
       he still struggles against the pull of the light side of the Force.

databank
       Finn

Finn
       FN-2187 was trained since birth to serve the First Order as a
       stormtrooper, but a skirmish on Jakku awakened his conscience and
       drove him down a different path, one that proved both heroic and
       dangerous. He helped Poe Dameron escape the First Order – picking
       up the nickname Finn in doing so – and then sought his own freedom
       alongside Rey and BB-8. Finn helped the Resistance destroy
       Starkiller Base, but had to decide his true loyalties: Would he
       continue to fight alongside the Resistance’s soldiers, or seek to
       reunite with Rey and flee the galactic conflict? At first Finn
       tried to flee the war, but a mission alongside Rose Tico convinced
       him that he had to commit himself to the Resistance’s cause.

databank
       Poe Dameron

Poe Dameron
       A commander in the Resistance’s starfighter corps, Poe Dameron is
       one of Leia Organa’s most-trusted operatives. A decorated X-wing
       pilot, he can fly anything – which is fortunate given how often his
       headstrong nature leads him into trouble. Poe leads the attack that
       destroys Starkiller Base, but soon finds himself on the run from
       the First Order. Sidelined without his beloved X-wing, he learns
       tough lessons about leadership, heroism and sacrifice.

databank
       Lando Calrissian

Lando Calrissian
       Lando Calrissian made a name for himself as captain of the
       Millennium Falcon and a sportsman seeking a fortune at the galaxy’s
       sabacc tables. After he lost his beloved ship to Han Solo, he spent
       years living the high life and pursuing get-rich-quick schemes,
       with uneven results. He went semi-respectable as the administrator
       of Cloud City, only to be drawn into the fight against the Empire.
       His quick wit and daring helped the Alliance destroy the second
       Death Star, completing Lando’s evolution from smooth-talking
       smuggler to galactic hero.

databank
       Chewbacca

Chewbacca
       During his long life Chewbacca has been many things: Wookiee
       warrior, ace smuggler and rebel hero. Chewie fought with the
       Republic on Kashyyyk during the Clone Wars, then befriended Han
       Solo while in Imperial captivity on Mimban. After adventures on
       Vandor and Kessel, he became Han’s co-pilot aboard the Millennium
       Falcon, and eventually helped the Alliance restore freedom to the
       galaxy. Known for his short temper and accuracy with a bowcaster,
       Chewie also had a big heart – and unflagging loyalty to his
       friends. He stuck with Han through years of turmoil, and flew the
       Falcon alongside Rey after the Corellian’s death.

databank
       Leia Organa

Leia Organa
       Princess Leia Organa was one of the Rebel Alliance’s greatest
       leaders, fearless on the battlefield and dedicated to ending the
       tyranny of the Empire. Daughter of Padmé Amidala and Anakin
       Skywalker, sister of Luke Skywalker, and with a soft spot for
       scoundrels, Leia ranks among the galaxy’s great heroes. But life
       under the New Republic has not been easy for Leia. Sidelined by a
       new generation of political leaders, she struck out on her own to
       oppose the First Order as founder of the Resistance. These setbacks
       in her political career have been accompanied by more personal
       losses.

databank
       BB-8

BB-8
       A skittish but loyal astromech, BB-8 accompanied Poe Dameron on
       many missions for the Resistance, helping keep his X-wing in
       working order. When Poe’s mission to Jakku ended with his capture
       by the First Order, BB-8 fled into the desert with a vital clue to
       the location of Jedi Master Luke Skywalker. He rejoined Poe and the
       service of the Resistance in time for the attack on Starkiller
       Base, then helped Rey locate Skywalker’s planet of exile.

databank
       C-3PO (See-Threepio)

C-3PO (See-Threepio)
       C-3PO is a droid programmed for etiquette and protocol, built by
       the heroic Jedi Anakin Skywalker, and a constant companion to
       astromech R2-D2. Over the years, he was involved in some of the
       galaxy’s most defining moments and thrilling battles -- and is
       fluent in more than seven million forms of communication. In the
       years after the Empire’s defeat C-3PO served Leia Organa, becoming
       the head of a Resistance spy ring aimed at undermining the First
       Order.
