Email Tracking Eliminates Guesswork

    1. hubspot-sales-email-notifications

Know the second a prospect becomes a lead.
       With email tracking, you get a desktop notification the second a
       prospect opens your email and clicks a link inside.
       Take the time to personalize your outreach after a lead engages
       with your emails, and continue to automate outreach to prospects
       who don’t.
       You’ll spend less time chasing cold prospects and more time closing
       warm leads.
    2. hubspot-sales-timely-follow-up

Get your emails opened and calls answered.
       You can make sure to follow up with leads when you’re already top
       of mind.
       Use notifications to follow up seconds after a lead opens an email,
       clicks a link, or downloads an important document such as a
       proposal.
       When you reach out at the right time, you can expect more email
       opens, answered calls, booked meetings, and sales.
    3. emailtracking3

See a lead’s entire history at a glance.
       Stop wondering if a lead “got your email” or if they found it
       interesting.
       A built-in activity stream automatically logs each lead’s history
       inside your browser or HubSpot Sales.
       You can see which emails, links, and documents were opened and
       when, then personalize your approach to get the sale.

Connect With the Apps Your Team Already Uses

   HubSpot Sales works seamlessly with Gmail, G Suite, and Outlook or
   Office 365.

   You can also send tracked emails directly within HubSpot CRM. Then
   control when and how you receive notifications: in HubSpot Sales, your
   browser, on your desktop, or in your CRM.

   email more than once.
   Get started free

   Works with Gmail, G Suite, and Outlook or Office 365 for Windows

Spend more time selling and less time drafting repetitive emails.

    1. HubSpot Sales - Email Templates

Send template emails from inside your inbox.
       Access a library of built-in templates designed for every step of
       your customer’s journey, or create your own from scratch.
       And your templates are always one click away inside your inbox –
       whether you use Outlook or Office 365 for Windows, or Gmail.
       You’ll save hours when you can send your most repetitive emails in
       seconds.
    2. HubSpot Sales - See which email templates work, and which don't

Optimize email templates with real-time metrics.
       Real-time metrics show you which of your templates are performing,
       and which ones need attention now.
       Your open rates tell you which subject lines your leads and
       customers can’t help but click. And your click rates tell you which
       buttons, links, and attachments they explore.
       You can see metrics across all of your templates, for an individual
       sales rep, and over any time period – it’s all there in your
       dashboard.
    3. HubSpot Sales - Share your best templates with your whole team.

Share your best templates with your whole team.
       Close more deals by sharing your best email templates with your
       entire team.
       See which email templates are sent, opened, and engaged with the
       most to uncover your time-saving and high-performing templates.
       Then give your team access to these templates inside of their
       inboxes. Now everyone has the best email for any situation at their
       fingertips.

Connect With the Apps Your Team Already Uses

   HubSpot Sales works seamlessly with Gmail, G Suite, and Outlook or
   Office 365 for Windows.

   Access all of your email templates from inside your inbox, personalize
   them in seconds, then hit send. Now you’re sending more and better
   emails in a fraction of the time.

       up the most relevant subject lines, content, links, attachments,
       and calls-to-action.
       Then schedule your email campaign, hit send, and know that your

Email Tracking Eliminates Guesswork

    1. hubspot-sales-email-notifications

Know the second a prospect becomes a lead.
       With email tracking, you get a desktop notification the second a
       prospect opens your email and clicks a link inside.
       Take the time to personalize your outreach after a lead engages
       with your emails, and continue to automate outreach to prospects
       who don’t.
       You’ll spend less time chasing cold prospects and more time closing
       warm leads.
    2. hubspot-sales-timely-follow-up

Get your emails opened and calls answered.
       You can make sure to follow up with leads when you’re already top
       of mind.
       Use notifications to follow up seconds after a lead opens an email,
       clicks a link, or downloads an important document such as a
       proposal.
       When you reach out at the right time, you can expect more email
       opens, answered calls, booked meetings, and sales.
    3. emailtracking3

See a lead’s entire history at a glance.
       Stop wondering if a lead “got your email” or if they found it
       interesting.
       A built-in activity stream automatically logs each lead’s history
       inside your browser or HubSpot Sales.
       You can see which emails, links, and documents were opened and
       when, then personalize your approach to get the sale.

Connect With the Apps Your Team Already Uses

   HubSpot Sales works seamlessly with Gmail, G Suite, and Outlook or
   Office 365.

   You can also send tracked emails directly within HubSpot CRM. Then
   control when and how you receive notifications: in HubSpot Sales, your
   browser, on your desktop, or in your CRM.

   Get up and running in seconds, and save time by never drafting the same
   email more than once.
   Get started free

   Works with Gmail, G Suite, and Outlook or Office 365 for Windows

Spend more time selling and less time drafting repetitive emails.

    1. HubSpot Sales - Email Templates

Send template emails from inside your inbox.
       Access a library of built-in templates designed for every step of
       your customer’s journey, or create your own from scratch.
       And your templates are always one click away inside your inbox –
       whether you use Outlook or Office 365 for Windows, or Gmail.
       You’ll save hours when you can send your most repetitive emails in
       seconds.
    2. HubSpot Sales - See which email templates work, and which don't

Optimize email templates with real-time metrics.
       Real-time metrics show you which of your templates are performing,
       and which ones need attention now.
       Your open rates tell you which subject lines your leads and
       customers can’t help but click. And your click rates tell you which
       buttons, links, and attachments they explore.
       You can see metrics across all of your templates, for an individual
       sales rep, and over any time period – it’s all there in your
       dashboard.
    3. HubSpot Sales - Share your best templates with your whole team.

Share your best templates with your whole team.
       Close more deals by sharing your best email templates with your
       entire team.
       See which email templates are sent, opened, and engaged with the
       most to uncover your time-saving and high-performing templates.
       Then give your team access to these templates inside of their
       inboxes. Now everyone has the best email for any situation at their
       fingertips.

Connect With the Apps Your Team Already Uses

   HubSpot Sales works seamlessly with Gmail, G Suite, and Outlook or
   Office 365 for Windows.

   Access all of your email templates from inside your inbox, personalize
   them in seconds, then hit send. Now you’re sending more and better
   emails in a fraction of the time.

Personalize emails to get more opens and clickthroughs.
       Get more of your emails opened and links clicked when you tailor
       each email to each subscriber.
       You can use an email subscriber’s lifecycle stage, list membership,
       or any information in their contact records to automatically serve
       up the most relevant subject lines, content, links, attachments,
       and calls-to-action.
       Then schedule your email campaign, hit send, and know that your
       email will show up in each inbox at the optimal time, regardless of
       time zone differences.

       rates and more sales.
       Dive even deeper into your data to see who’s engaging with each
       email and when, what device they were using, the most popular links
