   transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the
   Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16. (C) The arbitration
   shall be held in Los Angeles, California.(D) The arbitrator’s decision
   shall be controlled by the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
   any of the other agreements referenced herein that the applicable user
   may have entered into in connection with the WSL Website. (F) There
   shall be no authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class or
   representative basis, arbitration can decide only your and/or WSL’s
   individual claims; the arbitrator may not consolidate or join the
   claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated. BY
   AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, YOU ARE WAIVING ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL OR
   TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. (G)the arbitrator shall not have the
   power to award punitive damages against you or WSL. (H) If you are able
   to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as
   compared to the costs of litigation, WSL will pay as much of your
   filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the
   arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being
   cost-prohibitive. (J) With the exception of (F) above, if any part of
   this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or
   illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the rules of JAMS, then the
   balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall
   be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid,
   unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained
   herein. If, however, subpart (f) is found to be invalid, unenforceable
   or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration Provision shall be
   null and void, and neither you nor WSL shall be entitled to arbitrate
   their dispute.

21. Amendments; Assignment

   You agree that WSL may update these Terms at any time, and it is your
   obligation to check for updates. Updates do not apply retroactively.
   You may not assign these Terms or assign any rights or delegate any
   obligations hereunder, in whole or in part.

22. Miscellaneous

   These Terms of Use, the Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy and any
   document or terms and conditions referred to herein constitute the
   entire agreement of the parties with respect to Your use of the WSL
   Website, and supersede all previous written or oral agreements between
   the parties with respect to such subject matter. No waiver by either
   party of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to be a waiver
   of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. The section headings
   used herein are for convenience only and shall not be given any legal
   meaning. You agree You must file any claim or cause of action arising
   out of or related to the WSL Website or these Terms of Use within one
   (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose, regardless of any
   statute or law to the contrary, acknowledging that any claim or cause
   of action filed after one (1) year would be forever barred and such
   rights hereby waived. All rights not expressly granted to You herein
   are hereby reserved to WSL. Sections 1, 3, 8, 10, 12, 18, 19, and this
   section 21 shall survive termination of this Agreement.
