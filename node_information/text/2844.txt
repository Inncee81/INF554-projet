   fan-favorite movies, TV shows, comics, books, and more.

   If Joker wasn’t called “Joker,” you’d never know it was a DC movie.
   Though there are characters with the last name “Wayne” and it takes
   place in a city called “Gotham,” there’s little else that distinguishes
   Todd Phillips’ latest film as a comic book movie. It’s a solid,
   well-made film that, ultimately, has a bit of an identity crisis.

   Joker isn’t quite sure what it wants to be. What it definitely is is a
   movie about a disturbed man named Arthur Fleck, played by Joaquin
   Phoenix. Arthur is a clown-for-hire who lives with his mother Penny
   (American Horror Story’s Frances Conroy) in a powder keg of a city
   that’s just waiting to explode. And, without really even realizing the
   impact his actions are having on the outside world, Arthur ends up
   lighting the fuse.

   Joker is a comic book origin story with very little comic book in it.
   The whole thing very purposefully feels like a love letter to cinema of
   the late ‘70s, early ‘80s rather than other dark DC superhero movies
   like Tim Burton’s Batman or Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight. Using
   that gritty aesthetic, Phillips is much more interested in dissecting
   what makes a comic book character real than making a real comic book
   character and, in that aim, he’s successful. Arthur is a fascinating
   and endlessly compelling person. He’s also terrifying and, for most of
   the film, sympathetic.

In the New Joker Trailer, a Broken Man Becomes Batmanʼs Greatest Foe

   We’ve already had a few glimpses of Todd Phillips’ take on how a man
   like the Joker could come to…
   Read more Read

   In fact, that sympathy is where much of the film’s fear comes from.
   This is the Joker. We should not like this person. And yet, the movie
   tricks us into doing that time and time again. We frequently see things
   happening that aren’t actually happening. Information is given that
   isn’t quite accurate. Arthur’s point of view is mostly unreliable. And
   so the film swings you between sympathy and pity or humor and
   awkwardness, sometimes in a single shot. Not knowing what to believe
   and how to feel is one of the film’s most interesting and strongest
   assets.

   Undoubtedly, the highlight of the film is Phoenix’s performance, which
   includes one of the best physical and mental transformations he’s done
   in his illustrious career. Phoenix takes Arthur everywhere, best
   represented by a condition where he laughs when he’s not supposed to.
   It makes for some terribly uncomfortable moments that personify him
   very acutely. We want to love Arthur. We want to cheer for him. Maybe
   we even do at times. But we cannot. The title of the movie tells you
   where this is going, and it’s nowhere good.

   Phillips, best known for comedies like Old School and The Hangover
   trilogy, is making his most complex movie yet with Joker. And though he
   co-wrote the movie with Scott Silver (The Fighter, 8 Mile) that lack of
   dramatic experience shows. Joker never seems to have a dominant
   message. The goal is clear, explain who the Joker is, but beyond that,
   the movie is chock full of so many themes at so many different times
   it’ll leave your head spinning.

   Advertisement

   Some of the film is about the working-class rising up against the upper
   class. Some of it is about abuse and its impact on mental development.
   Other parts are about bullying, gun control, the news media, really,
   almost any and everything. If you choose to look at it in a certain
   way, Joker is a man who unknowingly incites violence and hatred and
   becomes a leader because of those warped ideas. Sound familiar? Despite
   being set almost 40 years in the past. Joker is such a timely,
   malleable movie that almost anything you want to read into it would be
   an equally valid interpretation. However, we never know what Phillips
   is trying to say among all these different messages.

   Which, appropriately, is both the best and worst thing about the film.
   You walk out of it bursting at the seams with discussion points. What
   was real? Was that intended? Why did that happen? And yet, if a movie
   is about everything, it almost becomes about nothing. There’s no real
   cohesion to what it is, or isn’t, trying to say. No point or message
   prevalent above all the others. The subtext feels largely garbled and
   at odds, with only Arthur’s character arc to hold everything together.
   And even then, because he’s such a complex character, it’s a little all
   over the map.

   With Arthur’s journey to becoming Joker as the main narrative drive of
   the film, the supporting characters mostly take a back seat. Few, if
   any, have more than 10 minutes of screen time in the film. That goes
   for characters played by Zazie Beetz, Robert De Niro, Marc Maron, Brian
   Tyree Henry, and others. For some, it’s even less than that. Their
   minor inclusions sometimes work to boost the film up but also can drag
   it down because we want to see more of their stories.

   It’s always about Arthur, and yet, Joker doesn’t really have a point of
   view on how we should feel about him at the end. Phillips doesn’t tip
   his hand one way or the other, leaving that sentiment almost entirely
   up to the audience, which in this day and age, is almost irresponsible.
   Most of the violence is saved until later in the film and its sporadic,
   yet intense, depiction is another way the director harkens back to the
   films of the past. Phillips uses using jarring sounds and quick
   editing, à la Martin Scorsese, to amplify the most violent moments.
   Yet, the intended shock value is slightly offset by the film’s
   insinuation that Arthur is, even partially, justified. Others
   characters are threatening him. They’re bullying him. What choice does
   he have but to retaliate with a vengeance?

   Advertisement

   That underdog, pathetic, anti-hero perspective doesn’t have much
   balance the other way. Arthur gets positive reinforcement, first from
   the public, later in the form of self-discovery, through his violence.
   As a result, you get the dangerous sense that some could walk out of
   Joker cheering for his triumphs instead of feeling disgusted by them.
   There’s no road map to solidify a point of view. No easy strings to
   grasp on to say “This is bad” other than the external knowledge that
   “The Joker is a comic book villain.” I wish there was. Phillips isn’t
   asking easy questions with the movie, which makes it interesting, but
   the commercial, comic book hook mostly feels at odd with that level of
   ambition. Maybe Joker is the movie that opens up a wider audience to
   more complex films, but considering the pessimistic world Joker
   reflects on us, probably not.

   One way Phillips kind of comments on the violence is through filmmaking
   juxtaposition. Visually, Joker is sumptuous, thanks in large part to
   the cinematography by Lawrence Sher and costumes by Mark Bridges. Each
   gives the film a grounded realism as Arthur walks through a building or
   drives through a tunnel, as well as a hint of mania when he puts on
   that dark red suit or striking white face make-up. As the film goes on,
   each ends up feeling like they were crafted for the sole purpose of
   making the few instances of visceral violence that much more disturbing
   when they happen.

   Even the comic book connections in the film fall into this murky
   category, though. For a movie that’s so dead set on being its own
   standalone thing, it sure goes out of the way to leave fans with
   threads that could spin off into other movies. For some, that’ll be
   very exciting, but I felt it did Joker a disservice. The movie doesn’t
   feel like we should want to see what’s next. We shouldn’t want to see
   this character commanding an army and fighting Batman. He’s too human.
   Too broken. That scenario too fantastic and unrealistic for this world.
   And yet the movie tries to balance all of those things together,
   unfocusing several narrative threads that would have been stronger on
   their own.

   Advertisement

   Then again, it’s important to remember the movie is called Joker. The
   Waynes are characters. Gotham City is the setting. And so, making a
   movie that has such a wild identity crisis could be exactly the point
   of the whole thing. Maybe it should be confusing. It shouldn’t have a
   point. Or maybe it should elicit emotional responses, for better or
   worse, and that’s it.

   Historically, the Joker character has been impossible to pin down. So
   it’s oddly fitting that his movie is too. Is the movie powerful and
   provocative? Yes. A little frustrating and unclear? Also yes. Are all
   of those things appropriate to the character? Absolutely. Maybe making
   Joker feel so unlike our usual comic book films, so potentially
   polarizing, so gutturally shocking, is exactly the right way to make a
   Joker movie. It’s just like him. Confused, misunderstood, but probably
   very clear from his own warped point of view.

There Really Is An LSD Shortage, And Here's Why

   Illustration for article titled There Really Is An LSD Shortage, And
   Here&#39;s Why

   Lysergic acid diethylamide used to be everywhere. LSD played a huge
   role in shaping pop culture in the 1960s, and in the 1980s everyone
   lived in fear of LSD-laced temporary tattoos and acid-popping
   Satanists. But nowadays, you rarely hear about it. What happened?

Top image: Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, art by Tiago Dinis

   First, some statistics.

   We do know that LSD-related emergency room visits dropped from over
   5,000 in 1999 to just 900 in 2002, and have hovered between 2,000 and
   4,000 per year since. According to the DEA, the age group most likely
   to do LSD in the past was high school seniors, and a University of
   Michigan survey of teen drug use finds a sharp decline in LSD use among
   12th graders:
   Illustration for article titled There Really Is An LSD Shortage, And
   Here&#39;s Why

   Advertisement

   "It looks to me like lack of availability has played a major role in
   the decline of this drug," says Lloyd Johnston, the UMich researcher
   who conducted the drug-use survey. He doesn't see any decline in
   interest in LSD — in fact, younger high-school students seem less
   concerned about its riskiness than they used to be.

   Plus if you google the phrase "LSD shortage," you find lots of message
   boards discussing this question, although there are plenty of people on
   those boards saying they still know where to get it.

   Advertisement

   So if there is an actual decrease in the supply of LSD, what's going
   on?

   The Pickard bust

   Most people will point to the 2000 arrest of a man named William L.
   Pickard, a UCLA researcher who allegedly was one of the biggest LSD
   suppliers in the world, and was trying to turn a decommissioned missile
   silo into a drug lab. He was a "superbrilliant chemist" and a Buddhist
   priest who had already served a four-year stretch for LSD possession in
   the late 1980s.

   Advertisement

   The feds claim that Pickard's arrest permanently reduced the supply of
   LSD in the United States — and there seems to be some truth to this.

   I talked to David Nichols, the former Distinguished Chair in Chemistry
   at Purdue University and current adjunct professor at University of
   North Carolina at Chapel Hill. And Nichols says it's really true about
   Pickard: "It is known that immediately after the arrest of Pickard, LSD
   almost disappeared from the streets. He was probably a major U.S., if
   not international manufacturer."

   Similarly, Johnston says he sees a sharp decline in LSD use among teens
   around 2001, although it was declining before that.

   Advertisement

   Another possible explanation for the decline in LSD availability is
   that a major distribution network dried up when the Grateful Dead's
   Jerry Garcia died and then Phish stopped touring as much. As a poster
   on one of those message boards explains:

     Jerry died & that was a huge hit, then Phish stopped touring like
     they used to, and that's that. Say what you want about those bands,
     but their tours provided a pipeline for LSD that sent it trickling
     down into all the nooks & crannies of the country.

   Why can't just anyone make LSD?

   The argument you often hear about LSD is that anybody with a knowledge
   of chemistry can make it — you just need the right chemicals. So why
   can't just anyone get their Walter White on and make some LSD in their
   school's chemistry lab?

   Advertisement

   According to Nichols, who's one of the world's leading LSD researchers,
   making LSD is indeed simple:

     LSD is a fairly sensitive chemical, requiring it to be kept out of
     bright lights, and stored in the dark and a cool place. But anyone
     with some basic organic chemistry lab skills could make it if they
     could get an ergot alkaloid and few other reagents.

   Advertisement

   The sticking point is the "ergot alkaloid," which Nichols says is the
   one key ingredient that's almost impossible to get. You can't make LSD
   without ergotamine or some other type of ergot alkaloid, which you use
   can turn into lysergic acid using hydrolysis.
   Illustration for article titled There Really Is An LSD Shortage, And
   Here&#39;s Why

   Advertisement

   "Pickard had connections in Eastern Europe, where ergot alkaloids are
   less stringently controlled," Nichols tells io9. "In the West, ergot
   alkaloids are 'watched chemicals.' You simply can't purchase them
   unless you are a legitimate and responsible company with a genuine need
   for them. If the suppliers are complying with U.S. law, an ordinary
   person simply can't buy them." The DEA, and drug agencies in most
   developed countries, keep very close tabs on ergotamine because it's a
   key ingredient of LSD.

   Advertisement

   It's pretty easy to get them in Hungary or the Czech Republic, because
   those places never had a huge LSD problem, says Nichols. But you'd need
   an import license to get them into the U.S. — which is almost
   impossible to obtain.

   What is ergot alkaline?

   It's actually a product of a kind of ergot fungus, called Claviceps,
   says Nichols. In the old days, this fungus was harvested from large
   fields in Europe in the fall. It's a "hard, dark, spike-shaped growth"
   that appears on rye or wheat grains.

   Advertisement

   But nowadays, people use large fermenters to grow the ergot alkaline in
   "submerged cultures of ergot fungus," says Nichols.

   According to the book Ergot: The Genus Claviceps (edited by Vladimir
   Kren and Ladislav Cvak), this fungus frequently caused ergot poisoning
   during the Middle Ages, leading to outbreaks of "ergotism," or
   "epidemic gangrene," including one disease known as St. Anthony's Fire.
   People would suffer gastrointestinal effects, as well as neurological
   effects such as seizures, from eating infected grains — and some people
   consider this one explanation for outbreaks of witchcraft.

   It wasn't until the 1930s that people like Walter A. Jacobs and Lyman
   C. Craig began to synthesize lysergic acid from ergotamine, and started
   to explore its potential medicinal properties — and it wasn't until
   1943 that a chemist named Albert Hoffman first created LSD, and
   accidentally dosed himself with it. (And then the CIA got a hold of
   it.)

   Therapeutic uses

   Even as LSD appears to be in permanent decline, both in terms of supply
   and in terms of people's interest in trying the drug — it's way less
   popular than MDMA, which Nichols refers to dismissively as "the
   Budweiser of psychedelics" — there's a sudden uptick in interest in
   using it therapeutically.

   Advertisement

   Back in July 2014, the first research paper about therapeutic uses of
   LSD in decades was published, in the Journal of Nervous and Mental
   Disease. Swiss therapists gave small doses of LSD to cancer patients in
   an end-of-life support group, and found that this "mystical experience"
   led to a significant reduction in the patients' levels of anxiety.

   This set off a round of articles in the mainstream press about
   reevaluating LSD and other hallucinogenics, as possibly helpful
   substances for patients with mental or emotional traumas.

   Advertisement

   But perhaps surprisingly, Nichols, who's spent his career studying LSD
   and being an advocate for taking the drug seriously, sounds a note of
   caution about using it in a therapeutic context. He especially doesn't
   think people should be using LSD to confront past traumas, at least
   without a lot of support and the proper setting:

     I don't know that confronting past traumas is the best application
     for LSD-assisted therapy, but however LSD is used in therapy, it
     should be administered by someone who has specialized training, and
     in a controlled setting. It has been known for a very long time that
     the effect of a psychedelic is highly dependent on set and setting.
     That is, set is the mind set or expectation of the person who
     receives the substance, and the setting is the environment in which
     it is given. I used to tell my students that if you took a
     psychedelic in a church or synagogue, with the expectation of having
     a religious experience, the probability of that happening was
     increased. But take the same dose of the same drug and go to a
     Friday the Thirteenth movie, or a Freddie Kruger movie, and the
     probability that you will have a religious experience is very low.

   We still don't know much about how LSD works

   And finally, Nichols says we still don't know that much about the
   actual mechanisms of how LSD affects your brain, 70 years after Albert
   Hoffman first dosed himself with it.

   "We don't understand LSD or other psychedelics at all," he says. "We
   know what the brain receptors are, and we know where a lot of them are
   expressed (i.e. in which brain regions)." But we know nothing about
   what brain dynamics they affect to produce a psychedelic state. We can
   understand a few "puzzle pieces," he adds, but we can't put the puzzle
   together.

   "I think until we understand the nature of consciousness itself, we
   won't understand how drugs change consciousness," Nichols concludes.

   Ghost Rider is dead, at least on HuluPhoto: ABC

   Hulu just did something hundreds of evil villains couldn’t do in the
   pages of Marvel Comics. It killed Ghost Rider.

   Deadline reports the streaming service has pulled the plug on the
   planned show citing “a creative impasse which could not be resolved.”
   It’s unknown if Marvel will be able, or wants to, shop Ghost Rider to
   another outlet—or perhaps even bring it over to Disney’s other
   streaming service, the upcoming Disney+—but the other series announced
   for Hulu alongside Ghost Rider, Helstrom, is apparently still in the
   works.

   Ghost Rider was set to star Terminator: Dark Fate’s Gabriel Luna as the
   supernatural character, reprising his role as the Robbie Reyes
   incarnation of Ghost Rider, who first appeared in this form on Agents
   of SHIELD.

   This is obviously a very recent development because, just a few short
   weeks back, io9 spoke with Luna about the show and he was very excited
   about it. “I love that we have a whole wonderful, beautiful writer’s
   room right now, just exploring Robbie’s psychology,” Luna said. “We get
   to continue to add to the canon, because it seems like everything we do
   with Robbie is just we’re pushing the canon. He’s existed since 2014.
   So we’re just adding more and more and more to this great story of
   Robbie Reyes’ Ghost Rider.”

   We’ll have more on Ghost Rider if it gets possessed by an evil force
   and comes back to life.

   Spider-Man and the Daily Bugle go together like Superman and the Daily
   Planet or Iron Man and Stark Industries. It’s simply the place the hero
   always works. Well, considering digital media, YouTube, and so on are
   all the rage now, our “new” live-action J. Jonah Jameson had to get
   with the times.

   The Tom Holland version of the character hasn’t been clued into the
   famous fictional news outlet though because let’s be honest, is it
   realistic to have a high school kid in 2019 working at a daily paper?
   They barely exist anymore. So fans were certainly excited to see this
   classic Spider-Man staple reimagined in Spider-Man: Far From Home,
   albeit with some unfortunate real-world comparisons.

   Now, months after the Marvel/Sony film’s release, there’s a new Daily
   Bugle on the internet.

   In celebration of the home release of Far From Home, Sony has launched
   TheDailyBugle.net. And with it comes a pretty big spoiler for the film.
   Illustration for article titled J. Jonah Jameson and the 2019 Version
   of Spider-Man&#39;s Daily Bugle Has Arrived

   Advertisement

   As seen at the end of Far From Home, this 2019 version of the Daily
   Bugle still has the same editor: J. Jonah Jameson, once again played by
   J.K. Simmons. This time, instead of a hard-ass newspaper editor, he’s a
   talking head conspiracy theorist releasing videos like this.

   “Don’t forget to like and subscribe” is not something we ever expected
   to hear Jameson say, but it certainly makes sense.

   Advertisement

   The rest of the site is pretty bare-bones, but there is a sort-of
   comment section, and four news stories on it, including an up to the
   minute one about the raid on Area 51. Another, of course, shits on
   Spider-Man and praises Mysterio. It’s unclear if Sony plans to update
   this page as the world of Spider-Man expands but, even if it doesn’t,
   it’s still cool to see this piece of Far From Home in reality.

   We’re wondering though, where’s the big exclusive about Spider-Man’s
   true identity? Surely that would be the top story and video on the
   site? Maybe further updates are coming after all?

   Spider-Man: Far From Home is now available on digital and comes to
