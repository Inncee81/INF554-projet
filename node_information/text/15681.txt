New Updates from ACM

   The following new information was passed along to us recently from ACM.
    Particularly of interest are the new subsidized language services.

Language Services

   ACM has partnered with American Journal Experts (AJE) to provide
   language editing (and translation) services to ACM authors. AJE has
   helped thousands of researchers around the world to present their
   research in polished English suitable for publication in journals such
   as those published by ACM. Editing is available for both Word and LaTeX
   files.

   To take advantage of this partnership, visit http://www.aje.com/ and
   enter referral code ACM15 for a 15% discount off all AJE services.
   (Editing services are at author expense and do not guarantee
   publication of a paper.)

   Please note that formatting assistance is provided at no charge to
   authors by Aptara, as specified on the author style guide
   pages: http://www.acm.org/publications/submissions/latex_style and
   http://www.acm.org/publications/word_style/word-style-toc/.

Guidance on Fair Use of Third-Party Material

   ACM has published Fair Use Guidelines for authors whose manuscripts
   include third-party material. Please read them
   here: http://www.acm.org/publications/guidance-for-authors-on-fair-use

Changes to ACM Author Rights

   New options for ACM authors to manage rights and permissions for their
   work: ACM introduces a new publishing license agreement, an updated
   copyright transfer agreement, and a new author-pays option which allows
   for perpetual open access through the ACM Digital Library. For more
   information, visit the ACM Author Rights webpage at authors.acm.org.

Changes to Conference Presentations

   You may be aware that in past years all accepted TOCHI papers were
   offered the opportunity to present at the next CHI conference. We are
   happy to announce that this policy is now expanding to include other
   ACM conferences, including CSCW and UIST. This list of conferences may
   expand to others associated with SIGCHI.

   Each paper will have the opportunity to present at only one conference.
   Authors will choose their preferred conference shortly after their
   paper is accepted. For conferences other than CHI, a liaison from the
   conference will evaluate the paper to judge whether it has a topical
   match to the conference. In the (hopefully rare) event that the liaison
   feels there is not a match, then the authors will still have an
   opportunity to present at the CHI conference.

   The recently approved SIGCHI policy on TOCHI presentations can be found
   here.
