   Most Thanksgiving meals are full of decadent and heavy foods. Add some
   contrast to the mix with a colorful and zippy salad that comes together
   quickly and seamlessly. Punchy bitter greens and fennel cut through the
   sweet, buttery, and starchy sides of the holiday and create a respite
   for your tastebuds. Thanksgiving or not, this salad is a simple yet
   sophisticated addition to your salad repertoire.

   It is full on squash season. If you love squash as much as I do, that
   means you are likely buying them by the armload at your greenmarket or
   grocery store. I am a sucker for simply roasted squash tossed into a
   salad or blitzed into a soup. If the #bowllife is more your thing, then
   this veg-filled crunch fest is the perfect way to enjoy your
   nutrient-rich fall bounty.

   The September 2018 issue of Bon Appetit Magazine features a chopped
   salad from San Francisco restaurant, Che Fico. The image alone sold me,
   but so did the layers of flavors from all the ingredients - honey
   roasted squash, seared brussels sprouts, bitter radicchio, marinated
   chickpeas, salty olives, and cheese all tossed with a peppy Italian
   dressing. The multi-step process to recreate this salad was definitely
   something I was not sold on. I love the idea of this hearty salad as a
   main, but don’t love the multiple steps required to make it. I set out
   to build a better version that did not take two plus hours, still
   tasted amazing, and shaved some of butter and the cheese from the
   original recipe.
