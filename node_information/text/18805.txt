Nobelprize.org, The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2000


     The exciting idea of combining the mouldability and low weight of
     plastics with the conductivity of metals has prompted intensive
     development. Since the conductivity can be varied over a very broad
     area, from poor semi-conductors to metallic-level conductivity, many
     commercial uses present themselves. Batteries, condensers,
     anti-static materials and anti-corrosion substances are some
     examples.
