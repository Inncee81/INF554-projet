17 Of The Most Unusual Beaches Around The World

   [profile__30.jpg] Lina D.
   BoredPanda staff

   When someone says “beach” you probably think of yellow or white sand,
   rolling waves, bright sunlight and a beer or fruity cocktail. But
   beaches come in far more different shapes and colors than some of us
   might have expected. Here are 17 beaches that, in one way or another,
   might not be anything like the beaches you’re used to.

   One of the most striking differences in many of these beaches are the
   different sand colors. Sand is generally formed out of whatever the
   waves happen to be banging against the shore, be they rocks, shells,
   corals, or glass. Rare green beaches can contain olivine, which is a
   remnant of volcanic eruptions, and black beaches are also generally
   formed by volcanic remnants. The pink beaches of Bermuda are colored by
   coral remnants.

   If you have a photo of a unique beach out there that should be on this
   list, share it with us below this post!

Unique Glass Beach in California

   The glass beach near Fort Bragg in California formed after the trash
   dumped there for years by local residents was pounded into sand by the
   surf. The dumping was eventually prohibited, but the glass sand
   remains.

   This beach in Mexico is said to have formed after the Mexican
   government used the uninhabited islands for target practice in the
   1900s.

Maldives Beach That Looks Like Starry Night Sky

   The lights on this beach in the Maldives are caused by microscopic
   bioluminescent phytoplankton, which give off light when they are
   agitated by the surf.

The Beach of the Cathedrals, Ribadeo, Spain

   The stunning cathedral-like arches and buttresses of this beach in
   Spain were formed by pounding water over thousands upon thousands
   years.

Pink Sand Beach, Bahamas

   The idyllic pink sand of the Bahamas is pigmented by washed-up coral
   remnants, which are dashed and ground to tiny pieces by the surf.

   The boulders on this New Zealand beach are concretions – balls of
   sedimentary rock harder than the sedimentary earth that formed around
   them, which has long since washed away. These boulders get uncovered
   and smoothed by pounding waves.

   The green sand on this beach in Hawaii is caused by the mineral
   olivine, which is formed by lava as it cools in the sea.

   The giant’s causeway was formed 50-60 million years ago when basalt
   lava rose to the surface and cooled, cracking into strange, large
   columns.

Punaluu Black Sand Beach, Hawaii

   amazing-unusual-beaches-6-1

   The black sand on Punaluu is formed by basalt lava, which explodes as
   it flows into the sea and rapidly cools.

Red Sand Beach, Rabida, Galapagos

   amazing-unusual-beaches-10-1

   The red sand at Rabida was formed due to the oxidization of iron-rich
   lava deposits, although it could also be due to washed-up coral
   sediments.

Shell Beach, Shark Bay, Australia

   amazing-unusual-beaches-7-1

   The water near Shell Beach in Australia is so saline that the cockle
   clam has been able to proliferate unchecked by its natural predators.
   It is this abundance of molluscs that floods the beaches with their
   shells.

Pfeiffer Purple Sand Beach, California

   The purple sand at this beach (which is only found in patches) is
   formed when manganese garnet deposits in the surrounding hills erode
   into the sea.

Vik Beach, Iceland

   Iceland is a land with a lot of volcanic activity, which is why black
   volcanic beaches are so common there.

   The Algarve coast consists of limestone, which is easily eroded and can
   form stunning sea caves like this one.

   create a feeling of invisibility.

Zoo Asks For Woman’s Help In Repairing Butterfly’s Wings, She Gives It A
Transplant

   Some people volunteer at animal shelters, others save kittens who
   accidentally gambol onto the road, while the founder of Insect Art
   repairs the wings of butterflies!

   The woman, who makes jewelry from real insects, is an expert at
   repairing butterfly wings, doing wing transplants, and making sure that
   these beautiful insects are restored to glory. This is a meticulous
   process that requires patience, dexterity, and a real passion for
   butterflies. Scroll down for Bored Panda’s exclusive in-depth interview
   with Katie VanBlaricum, the woman who was responsible for the
   butterfly’s successful wing transplant.

   As unbelievably cool as it sounds, Insect Art’s founder isn’t the only
   person doing surgery on butterflies: be sure to read Bored Panda’s post
   about Romy McCloskey and how she repairs butterflies’ broken wings as
   well.

The founder of Insect Art helped a Monarch butterfly fly again by repairing
its wings

   Katie VanBlaricum, the founder of Insect Art from Topeka in Kansas,
   elaborated about the butterfly surgery in an interview with Bored
   Panda.

   “It is not difficult for me to repair the wings since I work with dead
   insects for a living.  It takes me less than 5 minutes to do the
   repair. You have to work fast, to avoid stressing the butterfly out any
   more than necessary.”

   “I have a friend who works at a butterfly conservatory, and I have seen
   his “Frankenstein” butterflies flying around there, so I knew it was
   possible. I asked him for advice, as well as consulting the internet,”
   Katie explained.

The transplant was a success!

   “I have always been interested in insects and wildlife.  My “Insect
   Art” business has been around for nearly 14 years now, and I make my
   living buying and selling insect specimens for art and science. They
   always come from sustainably farmed sources.”

   “I did take some entomology classes in college, but my degree was in
   Anthropology. My favorite thing about insects is their diversity,”
   Katie went into detail. “Any shape or color or behavior you can dream
   up, there’s an insect for that! I am very much inspired by people like
   Steve Irwin whose passion it was to make the world love the
   underappreciated animals.”

…and later flew off into the sky!

   “Lots of people think they don’t like “bugs”, but once they come to
   know and understand them, most people can find something to love about
   insects!  I have volunteered for wildlife rehab for over ten years, and
   I’m a docent at our local zoo, so helping animals and helping people
   understand animals is a long term passion of mine.”

   Katie also confirmed that she has, in fact, volunteered at animal
   shelters, as well as saved kittens who had wandered onto the road.

The founder of Insect Art has been helping butterflies for several years

   “This one was deformed out of the chrysalis, so I did a wing
   transplant. Hoping he can fly tomorrow,” the creator of Insect Art
   posted on her Facebook page, detailing that the insect had problems
   flying from the moment it was born.

   The butterfly surgeon got more than 34,000 likes, 32,000 shares, and
   3,800 comments when she posted photos of how she helped the insect in
   need.

   According to the insect doctor, the Monarch butterfly had regained its
   strength and was able to fly perfectly! Godspeed, little buddy!

   The founder of Insect Art makes jewelry from insects by rehydrating
   them and making them look natural and lifelike. Each piece of jewelry
   she makes takes her “takes several days, and each end result is
   unique.”

Here is a step-by-step guide on how to help butterflies fly again

   Monarch butterflies are also known as milkweed, the common tiger, the
   wanderer, and the black veined brown. I don’t know about you, dear
   Readers, but the common tiger and the wanderer might even sound better
   than ‘Monarch.’

   These butterflies have a wingspan usually between 3.5 and 4 inches (8.9
   to 10.2 centimeters). Monarchs are sometimes confused with Viceroys who
   are patterned and colored similarly but are far smaller and have an
   extra black stripe across each hindwing.

You can watch the full video here

   During the autumn migration, Monarch butterflies fly thousands of miles
   southward. What’s also notable about these butterflies is that Monarchs
   have been bred on the International Space Station. You could even say
   that they’re out of this world.

   What do you think about butterfly surgery? What’s the most beautiful
   species of butterfly in your opinion? Have you ever helped out an
   animal in need of help? I saved a snail from getting squashed this
   morning, for example. Let us know how you’re helping animals in the
   comments below.

This is what people had to say about the butterfly surgery

   How wonderful! I didn't realize that was possible. After visiting a
   butterfly garden years back, they told us never to touch the butterfly
   wings because it could limit their chances of survival so if you
   absolutely had to move them, grab carefully by the bottom part of the
   wings only. It's amazing to see the delicacy involved in this repairing
   process.

   How wonderful! I didn't realize that was possible. After visiting a
   butterfly garden years back, they told us never to touch the butterfly
   wings because it could limit their chances of survival so if you
   absolutely had to move them, grab carefully by the bottom part of the
   wings only. It's amazing to see the delicacy involved in this repairing
   process.

17 Of The Most Unusual Beaches Around The World

   [profile__30.jpg] Lina D.
   BoredPanda staff

   When someone says “beach” you probably think of yellow or white sand,
   rolling waves, bright sunlight and a beer or fruity cocktail. But
   beaches come in far more different shapes and colors than some of us
   might have expected. Here are 17 beaches that, in one way or another,
   might not be anything like the beaches you’re used to.

   One of the most striking differences in many of these beaches are the
   different sand colors. Sand is generally formed out of whatever the
   waves happen to be banging against the shore, be they rocks, shells,
   corals, or glass. Rare green beaches can contain olivine, which is a
   remnant of volcanic eruptions, and black beaches are also generally
   formed by volcanic remnants. The pink beaches of Bermuda are colored by
   coral remnants.

   If you have a photo of a unique beach out there that should be on this
   list, share it with us below this post!

   The glass beach near Fort Bragg in California formed after the trash
   dumped there for years by local residents was pounded into sand by the
   surf. The dumping was eventually prohibited, but the glass sand
   remains.

   This beach in Mexico is said to have formed after the Mexican
   government used the uninhabited islands for target practice in the
   1900s.

   The lights on this beach in the Maldives are caused by microscopic
   bioluminescent phytoplankton, which give off light when they are
   agitated by the surf.

The Beach of the Cathedrals, Ribadeo, Spain

   The stunning cathedral-like arches and buttresses of this beach in
   Spain were formed by pounding water over thousands upon thousands
   years.

   The idyllic pink sand of the Bahamas is pigmented by washed-up coral
   remnants, which are dashed and ground to tiny pieces by the surf.

   The boulders on this New Zealand beach are concretions – balls of
   sedimentary rock harder than the sedimentary earth that formed around
   them, which has long since washed away. These boulders get uncovered
   and smoothed by pounding waves.

   The green sand on this beach in Hawaii is caused by the mineral
   olivine, which is formed by lava as it cools in the sea.

   The giant’s causeway was formed 50-60 million years ago when basalt
   lava rose to the surface and cooled, cracking into strange, large
   columns.

   The black sand on Punaluu is formed by basalt lava, which explodes as
   it flows into the sea and rapidly cools.

   The red sand at Rabida was formed due to the oxidization of iron-rich
   lava deposits, although it could also be due to washed-up coral
   sediments.

Shell Beach, Shark Bay, Australia

   The water near Shell Beach in Australia is so saline that the cockle
   clam has been able to proliferate unchecked by its natural predators.
   It is this abundance of molluscs that floods the beaches with their
   shells.

   The purple sand at this beach (which is only found in patches) is
   formed when manganese garnet deposits in the surrounding hills erode
   into the sea.

   Iceland is a land with a lot of volcanic activity, which is why black
   volcanic beaches are so common there.

   There is something melancholy about long silent hallways. Maybe because
   it reminds us that we are simply a dot in this vast universe. It can
   create a feeling of invisibility.

Zoo Asks For Woman’s Help In Repairing Butterfly’s Wings, She Gives It A
Transplant

   [JGrinevicius__30.jpg]

   Some people volunteer at animal shelters, others save kittens who
   accidentally gambol onto the road, while the founder of Insect Art
   repairs the wings of butterflies!

   The woman, who makes jewelry from real insects, is an expert at
   repairing butterfly wings, doing wing transplants, and making sure that
   these beautiful insects are restored to glory. This is a meticulous
   process that requires patience, dexterity, and a real passion for
   butterflies. Scroll down for Bored Panda’s exclusive in-depth interview
   with Katie VanBlaricum, the woman who was responsible for the
   butterfly’s successful wing transplant.

   As unbelievably cool as it sounds, Insect Art’s founder isn’t the only
   person doing surgery on butterflies: be sure to read Bored Panda’s post
   about Romy McCloskey and how she repairs butterflies’ broken wings as
   well.

The founder of Insect Art helped a Monarch butterfly fly again by repairing

   Katie VanBlaricum, the founder of Insect Art from Topeka in Kansas,
   elaborated about the butterfly surgery in an interview with Bored
   Panda.

   “It is not difficult for me to repair the wings since I work with dead
   insects for a living.  It takes me less than 5 minutes to do the
   repair. You have to work fast, to avoid stressing the butterfly out any
   more than necessary.”

   “I have a friend who works at a butterfly conservatory, and I have seen
   his “Frankenstein” butterflies flying around there, so I knew it was
   possible. I asked him for advice, as well as consulting the internet,”
   Katie explained.

The transplant was a success!

   “I have always been interested in insects and wildlife.  My “Insect
   Art” business has been around for nearly 14 years now, and I make my
   living buying and selling insect specimens for art and science. They
   always come from sustainably farmed sources.”

   “I did take some entomology classes in college, but my degree was in
   Anthropology. My favorite thing about insects is their diversity,”
   Katie went into detail. “Any shape or color or behavior you can dream
   up, there’s an insect for that! I am very much inspired by people like
   Steve Irwin whose passion it was to make the world love the
   underappreciated animals.”

…and later flew off into the sky!

   “Lots of people think they don’t like “bugs”, but once they come to
   know and understand them, most people can find something to love about
   insects!  I have volunteered for wildlife rehab for over ten years, and
   I’m a docent at our local zoo, so helping animals and helping people
   understand animals is a long term passion of mine.”

   Katie also confirmed that she has, in fact, volunteered at animal
   shelters, as well as saved kittens who had wandered onto the road.

The founder of Insect Art has been helping butterflies for several years

   “This one was deformed out of the chrysalis, so I did a wing
   transplant. Hoping he can fly tomorrow,” the creator of Insect Art
   posted on her Facebook page, detailing that the insect had problems
   flying from the moment it was born.

   The butterfly surgeon got more than 34,000 likes, 32,000 shares, and
   3,800 comments when she posted photos of how she helped the insect in
   need.

   According to the insect doctor, the Monarch butterfly had regained its
   strength and was able to fly perfectly! Godspeed, little buddy!

   The founder of Insect Art makes jewelry from insects by rehydrating
   them and making them look natural and lifelike. Each piece of jewelry
   she makes takes her “takes several days, and each end result is
   unique.”

Here is a step-by-step guide on how to help butterflies fly again

   Monarch butterflies are also known as milkweed, the common tiger, the
   wanderer, and the black veined brown. I don’t know about you, dear
   Readers, but the common tiger and the wanderer might even sound better
   than ‘Monarch.’

   These butterflies have a wingspan usually between 3.5 and 4 inches (8.9
   to 10.2 centimeters). Monarchs are sometimes confused with Viceroys who
   are patterned and colored similarly but are far smaller and have an
   extra black stripe across each hindwing.

You can watch the full video here

   During the autumn migration, Monarch butterflies fly thousands of miles
   southward. What’s also notable about these butterflies is that Monarchs
   have been bred on the International Space Station. You could even say
   that they’re out of this world.

   What do you think about butterfly surgery? What’s the most beautiful
   species of butterfly in your opinion? Have you ever helped out an
   animal in need of help? I saved a snail from getting squashed this
   morning, for example. Let us know how you’re helping animals in the
   comments below.

This is what people had to say about the butterfly surgery

   How wonderful! I didn't realize that was possible. After visiting a
   butterfly garden years back, they told us never to touch the butterfly
   wings because it could limit their chances of survival so if you
   absolutely had to move them, grab carefully by the bottom part of the
   wings only. It's amazing to see the delicacy involved in this repairing
   process.
