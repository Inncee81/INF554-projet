Premium Plan Usage Rates and Limits

   This page is only for customers with the new version of the Google Maps
   APIs Premium Plan, which became available in January 2016.

   Have the Premium Plan or a previous license?
   To determine which license you have:
   > In the Google Cloud Support Portal, click Maps: Usage Report on the
   left.
   > Does the ID at the top of the report have the following format?
      gme-[company] & proj-[number] ([type])
   If yes, you have the Premium Plan.
   If no, you have a previous license (Maps APIs for Work or Maps API for
   Business).

Usage rates

   With the Google Maps APIs Premium Plan, your application consumes quota
   at different rates, depending on the APIs it requests.

Maps APIs Credits

   As a Premium Plan customer, you purchase quota—called Maps APIs
   Credits—for one or more years, based on an estimate of your
   application's annual usage. All of your application's requests for Maps
   APIs consume credits from the pool of credits you purchased. For
   example, if your application uses the Maps JavaScript API to display a
   map, it will consume credits for the Maps JavaScript API map loads. If
   your application consumes all of the credits in the pool, you can
   purchase additional credits, as needed.

Usage rates by API

   This type of API request... Consumes this many Maps APIs Credits...
   Maps JavaScript API map load 1
   Maps Static API, Street View Static API map load
   0.25
   Street View Static API metadata request
   0
   Mobile SDKs (Android, iOS) map load 1
   Places API server-side and client-side request; excluding Place
   Autocomplete 2
   Place Autocomplete (server-side and client-side) request 0.1
   Web service APIs (server-side) request: Geocoding API, Directions API,
   Distance Matrix API (per element), Elevation API, Geolocation API, Time
   Zone API, Roads API 0.25 (after included daily usage limit)
   Client-side request: Geocoding API, Directions API, Distance Matrix API
   (per element), Elevation API 0.25 (after included daily usage limit)

Map loads

   Web APIs:

   A single map load is charged when any of the following occur:
     * A web page or application displays a map using the Maps JavaScript
       API.
     * An application requests a single map image from the Maps Static
       API.

   Street View panoramas are charged separately from map loads:
     * A static Street View panorama is charged for each request to the
       Street View Static API to embed a static (non-interactive) Street
       View panorama.
     * A dynamic Street View panorama is charged for each instantiation of
       a panorama object in a Maps JavaScript API, Maps SDK for Android,
       Maps SDK for iOS application.

   After a web page or application loads a map, or a static map image, or
   a Street View panorama, any user interactions with it, such as panning,
   zooming, or switching map layers, do not generate additional map loads
   or affect usage limits.

   Mobile SDKs:

   A single map load is charged for each instantiation of a Google map or
   panorama object in an Android or iOS mobile application:
     * A GMSMapView or GMSPanoramaView object on iOS.
     * One of MapFragment, SupportMapFragment, MapView,
       StreetViewPanoramaFragment, SupportStreetViewPanoramaFragment, or
       StreetViewPanoramaView on Android. A map load is counted each time
       the related onCreate() method is called.

   Once a mobile application loads a map or a Street View panorama, any
   user interactions with it do not generate additional map loads or
   affect usage limits.

Places API usage

   Requests for Place Search, Details, and Photos are charged separately
   from requests for Place Autocomplete. For example, in an Autocomplete
   widget, if a user enters an average of 5 characters (keystrokes) to
   find a place, and the user then selects that place to get details about
   it, your application consumes credits as follows:

   5 Place Autocomplete requests × 0.1 (0.5 credits) + Place Details
   (place selection) request (2 credits) = 2.5 credits

   The Places SDK for Android and the Places SDK for iOS are not available
   for sale and therefore not included with the Premium Plan.

Usage Limits

Total usage limits

   All of your application's requests for APIs consume Maps APIs Credits.
   Therefore, your application's total usage limit is determined by the
   number of credits you purchased. If you run out of Maps APIs Credits,
   your application's requests will continue to succeed, but your account
   may be subject to overage fees. In this case, you'll need to renew your
   Google Maps APIs Premium Plan license as soon as possible to avoid a
   suspension of your account. As you consume your quota, Google sends
   consumption notices via email based on the following increments: at 25%
   used (if used within the first 60 days), 50%, 75%, 85%, 100%, 110%, and
   130%.

Maps JavaScript API

   Requests for the Maps JavaScript API that generate map loads are
   applied against the total number of Maps APIs Credits you purchased for
   your Premium Plan.

Maps JavaScript API services (client side)

   The following are usage limits for client-side services that your
   application requests from the Maps JavaScript API:
   Service Limits
   Directions Shared* daily free quota of 100,000 requests per 24 hours;
   additional requests applied against the annual purchase of Maps APIs
   Credits. Maximum of 23 waypoints per request. Rate limit applied per
   user session, regardless of how many users share the same project.**
   Elevation Shared* daily free quota of 100,000 requests per 24 hours;
   additional requests applied against the annual purchase of Maps APIs
   Credits. Maximum of 512 points per request. Rate limit applied per user
   session, regardless of how many users share the same project.**
   Geocoding Shared* daily free quota of 100,000 requests per 24 hours;
   additional requests applied against the annual purchase of Maps APIs
   Credits. Rate limit applied per user session, regardless of how many
   users share the same project.**
   Distance Matrix Shared* daily free quota of 100,000 elements per 24
   hours; additional requests applied against the annual purchase of Maps
   APIs Credits. Up to 100 elements per request (with a maximum of 25
   origins and 25 destinations per request). Note: requests
   using mode=transit or using the optional parameter departure_time when
   mode=driving are limited to 100 elements per request. Rate limit
   applied per user session, regardless of how many users share the same
   project.**

   * The 100,000 daily free requests are shared across all Maps JavaScript
   API client-side services and Google Maps APIs web services—all requests
   are subtracted from the same pool of 100,000 free daily requests. Any
   additional requests are applied against the total number of Maps APIs
   Credits you purchased for your Premium Plan. Your free daily request
   pool is reset at 12:00 am Pacific Time. Note that the 100,000 daily
   free requests do not apply to Location Services licenses.

   ** When you first load the API, you are allocated an initial quota of
   requests. Once you use this quota, the API enforces rate limits on
   additional requests on a per-second basis. If too many requests are
   made within a certain time period, the API returns an OVER_QUERY_LIMIT
   response code. The per-session rate limit prevents the use of
   client-side services for batch requests, such as batch geocoding. For
   batch requests, use our web service APIs.

Google Maps Mobile SDKs

   Services Limits

   Maps SDK for Android
   Maps SDK for iOS

   Each map load is applied against the total number of Maps APIs Credits
   purchased for your Premium Plan

Google Maps Image APIs

          Services        Limits
   Maps Static API

   Requests are applied against the total number of Maps APIs Credits you
   purchased for your Premium Plan.

   The maximum image size is 2048 by 2048 pixels, depending on the scale
   parameter, as explained below.
   Street View Static API

   Requests are applied against the total number of Maps APIs Credits you
   purchased for your Premium Plan.

   The maximum image size is 2048 by 2048 pixels.

   Note that Street View Static API metadata requests are free and do not
   consume any Maps APIs Credits.

   Your application can request Maps Static API images up to 2048 by 2048
   pixels. Because the scale value in a static map request affects the
   number of pixels returned, the maximum size value is different for each
   scale level:
   Scale Max Size   Returns
   1     2048x2048 2048x2048
   2     1024x1024 2048x2048
   4     512x512   2048x2048

   The Street View Static API does not support the scale parameter.

Web service APIs

   Web service Limits
   Directions Shared* daily free quota of 100,000 requests per 24 hours;
   additional requests applied against the annual purchase of Maps APIs
   Credits. Maximum of 23 waypoints per request. 50** requests per second.
   Elevation Shared* daily free quota of 100,000 requests per 24 hours;
   additional requests applied against the annual purchase of Maps APIs
   Credits. Maximum of 512 points per request. 50** requests per second.

   additional requests applied against the annual purchase of Maps APIs
   Credits. 50** requests per second.
   Distance Matrix Shared* daily free quota of 100,000 elements per 24
   hours; additional requests applied against the annual purchase of Maps
   APIs Credits. Up to 625 elements per request (with a maximum of 25
   origins and 25 destinations per request). Rate limit of 1,000 elements
   per second. Note: requests using the optional parameter departure_time
   when mode=driving are limited to 100 elements per request.
   Geolocation Shared* daily free quota of 100,000 requests per 24 hours;
   additional requests applied against the annual purchase of Maps APIs
   Credits. 50** requests per second.
   Time Zone Shared* daily free quota of 100,000 requests per 24 hours;
   additional requests applied against the annual purchase of Maps APIs
   Credits. 50** requests per second.
   Roads Shared* daily free quota of 100,000 requests per 24 hours;
   additional requests applied against the annual purchase of Maps APIs
   Credits. 50** requests per second. Each request may contain up to 100
   points.

   * The 100,000 daily free requests are shared across all Maps JavaScript
   API client-side services and Google Maps APIs web services—all requests
   are subtracted from the same pool of 100,000 free daily requests. Any
   additional requests are applied against the total number of Maps APIs
   Credits you purchased for your Premium Plan. Your free daily request
   pool is reset at 12:00 am Pacific Time. Note that the 100,000 daily

Data Dumps

   The Freebase API has been shut down. This page provides access to the
   last available data dump.

   Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They
   constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema
   that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The
   Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples

   This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.
     * Total triples: 1.9 billion
     * Updated: Weekly
     * Data Format: N-Triples RDF
     * License: CC-BY

   22 GB gzip
   250 GB uncompressed (BUTTON) [download_icon.png] Download

   The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8
   text and compressed with Gzip.

ax-ns#type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .

   If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more
   efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the
   data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .

   Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF
   those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like
   /common/topic are written as common.topic.

   The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID
   (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex.
   common.topic) for schema.

   The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or
   a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign
   key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up
   keys by namespace.

   The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a
   human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies.
   It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric
   values.

   Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple
   fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".

Freebase Deleted Triples

   We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase
   over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future,
   we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted
   triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so,
   and are only providing this one-time dump.

   The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb
   uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files
   (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just
   easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).

   Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data
   release possible.
     * Total triples: 63 million
     * Updated: June 9, 2013
     * Data Format: CSV
     * License: CC-BY

   2 GB gzip
   8 GB uncompressed (BUTTON) [download_icon.png] Download

   The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The
   object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as
   any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the
   other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can
   still be parsed unambiguously.

   The columns in the dataset are defined as:
     * creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
     * creator
     * deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
     * deletor
     * subject (MID)
     * predicate (MID)
     * object (MID/Literal)

   The Google Hosted Libraries is a stable, reliable, high-speed, globally
   available content distribution network for the most popular,
   open-source JavaScript libraries.

   Google works directly with the key stakeholders for each library effort
   and accepts the latest versions as they are released.

Libraries

   To load a hosted library, copy and paste the HTML snippet for that
   library (shown below) in your web page. For instance, to load jQuery,
   embed the <script
   src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.4.1/jquery.min.js">
   </script> snippet in your web page.

   We recommend that you load libraries from the CDN via HTTPS, even if
   your own website only uses HTTP. Nowadays, performance is fast, and
   caching works just the same. The CDN's files are served with CORS and
   Timing-Allow headers and allowed to be cached for 1 year.

Troubleshooting

   Seeing an outdated version? Make sure you're not using the "automatic
   version" links, like /jqueryui/1/..., but instead use URLs referring to
   exact versions. Due to concerns over caching and lack of compatibility
   between even minor versions, we have deprecated and stopped updating
   the automatic version aliases some time ago, so they will forever refer
   to an old version (in order to not break existing sites that still use
   them).

   If you encounter problems:
     * Look for typos. Remember that JavaScript is a case-sensitive
       language.
     * Use a JavaScript debugger. In Chrome, use the Chrome DevTools. In
       Firefox, you can use the built-in Firefox DevTools. In IE, you can
       use the F12 developer tools.

Premium Plan Usage Rates and Limits

   This page is only for customers with the new version of the Google Maps
   APIs Premium Plan, which became available in January 2016.

   Have the Premium Plan or a previous license?
   To determine which license you have:
   > In the Google Cloud Support Portal, click Maps: Usage Report on the
   left.
   > Does the ID at the top of the report have the following format?
      gme-[company] & proj-[number] ([type])
   If yes, you have the Premium Plan.
   If no, you have a previous license (Maps APIs for Work or Maps API for
   Business).

Usage rates

   With the Google Maps APIs Premium Plan, your application consumes quota
   at different rates, depending on the APIs it requests.

Maps APIs Credits

   As a Premium Plan customer, you purchase quota—called Maps APIs
   Credits—for one or more years, based on an estimate of your
   application's annual usage. All of your application's requests for Maps
   APIs consume credits from the pool of credits you purchased. For
   example, if your application uses the Maps JavaScript API to display a
   map, it will consume credits for the Maps JavaScript API map loads. If
   your application consumes all of the credits in the pool, you can
   purchase additional credits, as needed.

Usage rates by API

   This type of API request... Consumes this many Maps APIs Credits...
   Maps JavaScript API map load 1
   Maps Static API, Street View Static API map load
   0.25
   Street View Static API metadata request
   0
   Mobile SDKs (Android, iOS) map load 1
   Places API server-side and client-side request; excluding Place
   Autocomplete 2
   Place Autocomplete (server-side and client-side) request 0.1
   Web service APIs (server-side) request: Geocoding API, Directions API,
   Distance Matrix API (per element), Elevation API, Geolocation API, Time
   Zone API, Roads API 0.25 (after included daily usage limit)
   Client-side request: Geocoding API, Directions API, Distance Matrix API
   (per element), Elevation API 0.25 (after included daily usage limit)

Map loads

   Web APIs:

   A single map load is charged when any of the following occur:
     * A web page or application displays a map using the Maps JavaScript
       API.
     * An application requests a single map image from the Maps Static
       API.

   Street View panoramas are charged separately from map loads:
     * A static Street View panorama is charged for each request to the
       Street View Static API to embed a static (non-interactive) Street
       View panorama.
     * A dynamic Street View panorama is charged for each instantiation of
       a panorama object in a Maps JavaScript API, Maps SDK for Android,
       Maps SDK for iOS application.

   After a web page or application loads a map, or a static map image, or
   a Street View panorama, any user interactions with it, such as panning,
   zooming, or switching map layers, do not generate additional map loads
   or affect usage limits.

   Mobile SDKs:

   A single map load is charged for each instantiation of a Google map or
   panorama object in an Android or iOS mobile application:
     * A GMSMapView or GMSPanoramaView object on iOS.
     * One of MapFragment, SupportMapFragment, MapView,
       StreetViewPanoramaFragment, SupportStreetViewPanoramaFragment, or
       StreetViewPanoramaView on Android. A map load is counted each time
       the related onCreate() method is called.

   Once a mobile application loads a map or a Street View panorama, any
   user interactions with it do not generate additional map loads or
   affect usage limits.

Places API usage

   Requests for Place Search, Details, and Photos are charged separately
   from requests for Place Autocomplete. For example, in an Autocomplete
   widget, if a user enters an average of 5 characters (keystrokes) to
   find a place, and the user then selects that place to get details about
   it, your application consumes credits as follows:

   5 Place Autocomplete requests × 0.1 (0.5 credits) + Place Details
   (place selection) request (2 credits) = 2.5 credits

   The Places SDK for Android and the Places SDK for iOS are not available
   for sale and therefore not included with the Premium Plan.

Usage Limits

Total usage limits

   All of your application's requests for APIs consume Maps APIs Credits.
   Therefore, your application's total usage limit is determined by the
   number of credits you purchased. If you run out of Maps APIs Credits,
   your application's requests will continue to succeed, but your account
   may be subject to overage fees. In this case, you'll need to renew your
   Google Maps APIs Premium Plan license as soon as possible to avoid a
   suspension of your account. As you consume your quota, Google sends
   consumption notices via email based on the following increments: at 25%
   used (if used within the first 60 days), 50%, 75%, 85%, 100%, 110%, and
   130%.

Maps JavaScript API

   Requests for the Maps JavaScript API that generate map loads are
   applied against the total number of Maps APIs Credits you purchased for
   your Premium Plan.

Maps JavaScript API services (client side)

   The following are usage limits for client-side services that your
   application requests from the Maps JavaScript API:
   Service Limits
   Directions Shared* daily free quota of 100,000 requests per 24 hours;
   additional requests applied against the annual purchase of Maps APIs
   Credits. Maximum of 23 waypoints per request. Rate limit applied per
   user session, regardless of how many users share the same project.**
   Elevation Shared* daily free quota of 100,000 requests per 24 hours;
   additional requests applied against the annual purchase of Maps APIs
   Credits. Maximum of 512 points per request. Rate limit applied per user
   session, regardless of how many users share the same project.**
   Geocoding Shared* daily free quota of 100,000 requests per 24 hours;
   additional requests applied against the annual purchase of Maps APIs
   Credits. Rate limit applied per user session, regardless of how many
   users share the same project.**
   Distance Matrix Shared* daily free quota of 100,000 elements per 24
   hours; additional requests applied against the annual purchase of Maps
   APIs Credits. Up to 100 elements per request (with a maximum of 25
   origins and 25 destinations per request). Note: requests
   using mode=transit or using the optional parameter departure_time when
   mode=driving are limited to 100 elements per request. Rate limit
   applied per user session, regardless of how many users share the same
   project.**

   * The 100,000 daily free requests are shared across all Maps JavaScript
   API client-side services and Google Maps APIs web services—all requests
   are subtracted from the same pool of 100,000 free daily requests. Any
   additional requests are applied against the total number of Maps APIs
   Credits you purchased for your Premium Plan. Your free daily request
   pool is reset at 12:00 am Pacific Time. Note that the 100,000 daily
   free requests do not apply to Location Services licenses.

   ** When you first load the API, you are allocated an initial quota of
   requests. Once you use this quota, the API enforces rate limits on
   additional requests on a per-second basis. If too many requests are
   made within a certain time period, the API returns an OVER_QUERY_LIMIT
   response code. The per-session rate limit prevents the use of
   client-side services for batch requests, such as batch geocoding. For
   batch requests, use our web service APIs.

Google Maps Mobile SDKs

   Services Limits

   Maps SDK for Android
   Maps SDK for iOS

   Each map load is applied against the total number of Maps APIs Credits
   purchased for your Premium Plan

Google Maps Image APIs

          Services        Limits
   Maps Static API

   Requests are applied against the total number of Maps APIs Credits you
   purchased for your Premium Plan.

   The maximum image size is 2048 by 2048 pixels, depending on the scale
   parameter, as explained below.
   Street View Static API

   Requests are applied against the total number of Maps APIs Credits you
   purchased for your Premium Plan.

   The maximum image size is 2048 by 2048 pixels.

   Note that Street View Static API metadata requests are free and do not
   consume any Maps APIs Credits.

   Your application can request Maps Static API images up to 2048 by 2048
   pixels. Because the scale value in a static map request affects the
   number of pixels returned, the maximum size value is different for each
   scale level:
   Scale Max Size   Returns
   1     2048x2048 2048x2048
   2     1024x1024 2048x2048
   4     512x512   2048x2048

   The Street View Static API does not support the scale parameter.

Web service APIs

   Web service Limits
   Directions Shared* daily free quota of 100,000 requests per 24 hours;
   additional requests applied against the annual purchase of Maps APIs
   Credits. Maximum of 23 waypoints per request. 50** requests per second.
   Elevation Shared* daily free quota of 100,000 requests per 24 hours;
   additional requests applied against the annual purchase of Maps APIs
   Credits. Maximum of 512 points per request. 50** requests per second.

   additional requests applied against the annual purchase of Maps APIs
   Credits. 50** requests per second.
   Distance Matrix Shared* daily free quota of 100,000 elements per 24
   hours; additional requests applied against the annual purchase of Maps
   APIs Credits. Up to 625 elements per request (with a maximum of 25
   origins and 25 destinations per request). Rate limit of 1,000 elements
   per second. Note: requests using the optional parameter departure_time
   when mode=driving are limited to 100 elements per request.
   Geolocation Shared* daily free quota of 100,000 requests per 24 hours;
   additional requests applied against the annual purchase of Maps APIs
   Credits. 50** requests per second.
   Time Zone Shared* daily free quota of 100,000 requests per 24 hours;
   additional requests applied against the annual purchase of Maps APIs
   Credits. 50** requests per second.
   Roads Shared* daily free quota of 100,000 requests per 24 hours;
   additional requests applied against the annual purchase of Maps APIs
   Credits. 50** requests per second. Each request may contain up to 100
   points.

   * The 100,000 daily free requests are shared across all Maps JavaScript
   API client-side services and Google Maps APIs web services—all requests
   are subtracted from the same pool of 100,000 free daily requests. Any
   additional requests are applied against the total number of Maps APIs
   Credits you purchased for your Premium Plan. Your free daily request
   pool is reset at 12:00 am Pacific Time. Note that the 100,000 daily

Data Dumps

   The Freebase API has been shut down. This page provides access to the
   last available data dump.

   Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They
   constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema
   that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The
   Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples

   This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.
     * Total triples: 1.9 billion
     * Updated: Weekly
     * Data Format: N-Triples RDF
     * License: CC-BY

   22 GB gzip
   250 GB uncompressed (BUTTON) [download_icon.png] Download

   The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8
   text and compressed with Gzip.

ax-ns#type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .

   If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more
   efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the
   data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .

   Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF
   those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like
   /common/topic are written as common.topic.

   The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID
   (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex.
   common.topic) for schema.

   The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or
   a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign
   key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up
   keys by namespace.

   The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a
   human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies.
   It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric
   values.

   Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple
   fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".

Freebase Deleted Triples

   We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase
   over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future,
   we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted
   triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so,
   and are only providing this one-time dump.

   The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb
   uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files
   (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just
   easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).

   Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data
   release possible.
     * Total triples: 63 million
     * Updated: June 9, 2013
     * Data Format: CSV
     * License: CC-BY

   2 GB gzip
   8 GB uncompressed (BUTTON) [download_icon.png] Download

   The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The
   object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as
   any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the
   other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can
   still be parsed unambiguously.

   The columns in the dataset are defined as:
     * creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
     * creator
     * deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
     * deletor
     * subject (MID)
     * predicate (MID)
     * object (MID/Literal)

   The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28,
   2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common

   Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common
   Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

   The Google Hosted Libraries is a stable, reliable, high-speed, globally
   available content distribution network for the most popular,
   open-source JavaScript libraries.

   Google works directly with the key stakeholders for each library effort
   and accepts the latest versions as they are released.

Libraries

   To load a hosted library, copy and paste the HTML snippet for that
   library (shown below) in your web page. For instance, to load jQuery,
   embed the <script
   src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.4.1/jquery.min.js">
   </script> snippet in your web page.

   We recommend that you load libraries from the CDN via HTTPS, even if
   your own website only uses HTTP. Nowadays, performance is fast, and
   caching works just the same. The CDN's files are served with CORS and
   Timing-Allow headers and allowed to be cached for 1 year.

Troubleshooting

   Seeing an outdated version? Make sure you're not using the "automatic
   version" links, like /jqueryui/1/..., but instead use URLs referring to
   exact versions. Due to concerns over caching and lack of compatibility
   between even minor versions, we have deprecated and stopped updating
   the automatic version aliases some time ago, so they will forever refer
   to an old version (in order to not break existing sites that still use
   them).

   If you encounter problems:
     * Look for typos. Remember that JavaScript is a case-sensitive
       language.
     * Use a JavaScript debugger. In Chrome, use the Chrome DevTools. In
       Firefox, you can use the built-in Firefox DevTools. In IE, you can
       use the F12 developer tools.
