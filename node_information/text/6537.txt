Support this plugin

   Maintaining this plugin takes a lot of time, time that I have to share
   with my work and my studies. If you appreciate my work, feel free to
   comment, rate, or even donate to the plugin. I need your help to
   continue maintaining the plugin, and bringing more features.

     * Example TinyMCE glossary term form
     * Example TinyMCE tooltip form
     * jQuery based Glossary term A to Z and term list
     * Glossary index shortcodes

Installation

   Either install through admin panel (this is the eaiest way), or:
    1. Upload ithoughts-tooltip-glossary.zip to the /wp-content/plugins/
       directory
    2. Unzip the archive
    3. Activate the plugin through the ‚ÄòPlugins‚Äô menu in WordPress

FAQ

     Does this plugin create any new tables?

   No. It uses custom post types and taxonomies.

     None of the details pages are working!

   Please resave your rewrite rules: Settings > Permalinks > Save Changes
   (just click the button)

     I got an error when loading my glossary tips

   It may be a permalink problem. Go to Settings > Permalinks and click
   Save Changes

     It doesn‚Äôt do anything?

   Check if jQuery is loaded.
   For glossary terms only, you have to add the terms (Tooltip Glossary >
   Add New Term) and then use the appropriate TinyMCE button to link the
   text with that glossary term

   Installation Instructions
          Either install through admin panel (this is the eaiest way), or:

Excellent tooltip plugin

   flongpre April 26, 2018
   While looking for a glossary / tooltip plugin in 2016, I found this one
   and I use it on 2 big sites since then. With the WPML compatibility and
   many other improvements, I was always happy to discover new features as
   we use it. The plugin is upgraded frequently and very well maintained
   by Gerkin who was always quick to fix bugs and answer questions in the
   forum.

A free five star plugin!!

   bobby1kenobi December 1, 2017
   To be honest I tried them all to find the best solution and here it is!
   This is the best tooltip plugin. Nice, smooth design, easy to use and
   to setup. Did I forgot something ? Yes- it's totally FREE. Thumbs up!
   üëçüëç

Great plugin, responsive help

   handwovenbox October 23, 2017
   Many thanks for the plugin. It works great and Gerkin has answered my
   questions quickly in the support forums.

Exactly what I was looking for!

   jorgenheld July 22, 2017
   Easy to install and activate. Perfect with the "Advanced attributes"
   button. I didn't realize that the option existed until I read the
   manual üôÇ Just mark the text string (or in my case a link) and click on
   the "Add a Tooltip" button. Add the text you want to appear in the pop
   up window. Done! Excellent work by the plugin developer!

Strange and Useless

   ist4000 November 21, 2016
   No function is working properly. The plugin does random things with no
   evident logical connection between each other. Very strange and
   absolutely useless. No description for shortcodes to try out things.
   Just the not working buttons in the tool panel of the editor.

Plugin with some issues but great active support

   Jos Klever September 3, 2016
   A client asked me to solve some issues on their website. It appeared to
   be impossible to update this plugin from 1.1.6 to 2.x, so I created a
   support ticket. Together we did some research and found a few
   improvements in the update process. During this process some other bugs
   were found and solved pretty quickly. Today with the release of 2.3.2
   every issue we found, is solved, so keep up the good work!

          configure the plugin and you‚Äôre done!

   Which web browsers work best with this plugin
          Though designed to work on most browsers, Zendesk Chat works

          or later (Mac, PC, or Linux), Safari 2 or later (Mac), Google
          Chrome (PC, Mac).

   I managed to install the plugin but cannot link up to Zendesk Chat.
          Why?
          The plugin tries to link up with Zendesk Chat by connecting
          using a few approaches including PHP Curl. If the outgoing
          connections are blocked (eg. by a firewall), please request your
          server administrator.

          Alternatively, you can also manually include the script in the
          footer file (‚Äúwp-content/themes/default/footer.php‚Äù in your
          wordpress installation).

   Is it free to use?
          The plugin comes with a free plan specially tailored for
          WordPress users. Power users can purchase upgrade options
          anytime.

   How can I chat with more visitors at the same time?
          You can easily do so by upgrading to a better plan. To find out
          more about the plans and features we offer, please visit

I like Zendesk a lot but WP plugin is disaster

   Marin Stoyanov January 11, 2018
   I thought that installing the plugin made by Zendesk team will be easy
   and i won't face any issues. Instead now I'm here and I write my
   review. WordPress Zendesk plugin is real disaster. It doesn't allow me
   to login to my account. I'm sure that my password and email are
   correct. I tripe-checked them and they are correct but the plugin
   doesn't allow me to login to my existing Zendesk account. Some
   suggestions for the authors: 1) We live in 21st century, logging with
   my real Zendesk username and password is real thread. Instead you can
   use API key, provide temporary access key or use other more intelligent
   way to associate WP website with Zendesk account 2) Most WP plugins,
   that require configuration after being activated, usually have a
   Settings link next to 'Details'. You're huge enough to do it.

Data leaked?

   Phil September 10, 2017
   The Zendesk Chat system itself works quite well, from what little
   chance we had to use it. However, a few months ago we received
   chat/messages from someone else's Zendesk account, which is hugely
   concering. I contacted support but haven't heard anything back in
   weeks. Very worrying! If you communicate any kind of private/sensitive
   data I'd highly recommend avoiding Zendesk Chat, possibly even Zendesk
   itself too since they are closely linked.

Cuidado. Cobran√ßa automatica.

   Rodolfo December 26, 2016
   Cuidado. Instalei o Zopim e paguei por 2 agentes por 6 seis meses. Ap√≥s
   isso o sistema renovou automaticamente, mesmo sem meu site estar no ar
   mais e mesmo sem usar o sistema deles. Entrei em contato e me
   informaram que n√£o devolveriam o dinheiro porque j√° havia passado o
   tempo para reclamar e que isso estava previsto, quando assinei. Tenho
   os e-mails, que compravam isso. Tomem muito cuidado! N√£o recomendo!

Easy and fast

   albaintrade September 22, 2016
   Very good application easy and fast... You can try on my website

nice plugin

   nicopozena79 September 10, 2016
   Pretty good service

I love this program, but it slows my site

   ddrevik September 3, 2016
   I love this plugin. It helps our website visitors tremendously to be
   able to ask questions and interact with us. Many are reluctant to call
   or email for fear of being inundated with sales calls, so this allows
   them to stay at arms reach until they get comfortable with us. Why only
   3 stars then? The speed. When I load the Zopim widget, my homepage load
   time goes from 6.5s to 12.3s. I can't have visitors waiting that long
   for our homepage to load. I could live with adding a second or so to
   our load, but 6 additional seconds is a deal-breaker.

Does just what I need it to. Sorry to see it close.

   Look, I realize this happens with a thriving open-source ecosystem:
   developers come and go. Plugins are maintained for years, and then
   finally the people who maintain them have to bid adieu. I get it. But
   if someone decides to take FD Feedburner on, I'm prepared to kick in
   coffee money. üôÇ

    2. Unzip the archive
    3. Activate the plugin through the ‚ÄòPlugins‚Äô menu in WordPress

FAQ

     Does this plugin create any new tables?

   No. It uses custom post types and taxonomies.

     None of the details pages are working!

   Please resave your rewrite rules: Settings > Permalinks > Save Changes
   (just click the button)

     I got an error when loading my glossary tips

   It may be a permalink problem. Go to Settings > Permalinks and click
   Save Changes

     It doesn‚Äôt do anything?

   Check if jQuery is loaded.
   For glossary terms only, you have to add the terms (Tooltip Glossary >
   Add New Term) and then use the appropriate TinyMCE button to link the
   text with that glossary term

   Installation Instructions
          Either install through admin panel (this is the eaiest way), or:

Excellent tooltip plugin

   flongpre April 26, 2018
   While looking for a glossary / tooltip plugin in 2016, I found this one
   and I use it on 2 big sites since then. With the WPML compatibility and
   many other improvements, I was always happy to discover new features as
   we use it. The plugin is upgraded frequently and very well maintained
   by Gerkin who was always quick to fix bugs and answer questions in the
   forum.

A free five star plugin!!

   bobby1kenobi December 1, 2017
   To be honest I tried them all to find the best solution and here it is!
   This is the best tooltip plugin. Nice, smooth design, easy to use and
   to setup. Did I forgot something ? Yes- it's totally FREE. Thumbs up!
   üëçüëç

Great plugin, responsive help

   handwovenbox October 23, 2017
   Many thanks for the plugin. It works great and Gerkin has answered my
   questions quickly in the support forums.

Exactly what I was looking for!

   jorgenheld July 22, 2017
   Easy to install and activate. Perfect with the "Advanced attributes"
   button. I didn't realize that the option existed until I read the
   manual üôÇ Just mark the text string (or in my case a link) and click on
   the "Add a Tooltip" button. Add the text you want to appear in the pop
   up window. Done! Excellent work by the plugin developer!

Strange and Useless

   ist4000 November 21, 2016
   No function is working properly. The plugin does random things with no
   evident logical connection between each other. Very strange and
   absolutely useless. No description for shortcodes to try out things.
   Just the not working buttons in the tool panel of the editor.

Plugin with some issues but great active support

   Jos Klever September 3, 2016
   A client asked me to solve some issues on their website. It appeared to
   be impossible to update this plugin from 1.1.6 to 2.x, so I created a
   support ticket. Together we did some research and found a few
   improvements in the update process. During this process some other bugs
   were found and solved pretty quickly. Today with the release of 2.3.2
   every issue we found, is solved, so keep up the good work!

FAQ

   Do I have to install any software on my server to get this working?
          Not at all! Zendesk Chat is a hosted livechat service. Simply
          configure the plugin and you‚Äôre done!

   Which web browsers work best with this plugin
          Though designed to work on most browsers, Zendesk Chat works
          best in the following environment: IE 6 or later (PC), Firefox 2
          or later (Mac, PC, or Linux), Safari 2 or later (Mac), Google
          Chrome (PC, Mac).

   I managed to install the plugin but cannot link up to Zendesk Chat.
          Why?
          The plugin tries to link up with Zendesk Chat by connecting
          using a few approaches including PHP Curl. If the outgoing
          connections are blocked (eg. by a firewall), please request your
          server administrator.

          Alternatively, you can also manually include the script in the
          footer file (‚Äúwp-content/themes/default/footer.php‚Äù in your
          wordpress installation).

   Is it free to use?
          The plugin comes with a free plan specially tailored for
          WordPress users. Power users can purchase upgrade options
          anytime.

   How can I chat with more visitors at the same time?
          You can easily do so by upgrading to a better plan. To find out
          more about the plans and features we offer, please visit
          https://www.zendesk.com/chat/pricing/#pricing

   Its just not working for me! HELP!
          Dont worry!! We are happy to assist! Just come on down to our
          site at https://www.zendesk.com/chat or leave an email for us at
          chat@zendesk.com and we will help you with installation.

   WordPress Integration for Chat accounts
          The integration supports chat phase 4, 3 and 1 accounts. If you
          have a zendesk subdomain, please provide your subdomain as you
          are either chat phase 3 or 4 customer. If you don‚Äôt have a
          subdomain, leave the subdomain field as blank as you are chat
          phase 1 customer.

Reviews

I like Zendesk a lot but WP plugin is disaster

   Marin Stoyanov January 11, 2018
   I thought that installing the plugin made by Zendesk team will be easy
   and i won't face any issues. Instead now I'm here and I write my
   review. WordPress Zendesk plugin is real disaster. It doesn't allow me
   to login to my account. I'm sure that my password and email are
   correct. I tripe-checked them and they are correct but the plugin
   doesn't allow me to login to my existing Zendesk account. Some
   suggestions for the authors: 1) We live in 21st century, logging with
   my real Zendesk username and password is real thread. Instead you can
   use API key, provide temporary access key or use other more intelligent
   way to associate WP website with Zendesk account 2) Most WP plugins,
   that require configuration after being activated, usually have a
   Settings link next to 'Details'. You're huge enough to do it.

Data leaked?

   Phil September 10, 2017
   The Zendesk Chat system itself works quite well, from what little
   chance we had to use it. However, a few months ago we received
   chat/messages from someone else's Zendesk account, which is hugely
   concering. I contacted support but haven't heard anything back in
   weeks. Very worrying! If you communicate any kind of private/sensitive
   data I'd highly recommend avoiding Zendesk Chat, possibly even Zendesk
   itself too since they are closely linked.

Cuidado. Cobran√ßa automatica.

   Rodolfo December 26, 2016
   Cuidado. Instalei o Zopim e paguei por 2 agentes por 6 seis meses. Ap√≥s
   isso o sistema renovou automaticamente, mesmo sem meu site estar no ar
   mais e mesmo sem usar o sistema deles. Entrei em contato e me
   informaram que n√£o devolveriam o dinheiro porque j√° havia passado o
   tempo para reclamar e que isso estava previsto, quando assinei. Tenho
   os e-mails, que compravam isso. Tomem muito cuidado! N√£o recomendo!

Easy and fast

   albaintrade September 22, 2016
   Very good application easy and fast... You can try on my website
   http://almanyayurtdisikargo.com/

nice plugin

   nicopozena79 September 10, 2016
   Pretty good service

I love this program, but it slows my site

   ddrevik September 3, 2016
   I love this plugin. It helps our website visitors tremendously to be
   able to ask questions and interact with us. Many are reluctant to call
   or email for fear of being inundated with sales calls, so this allows
   them to stay at arms reach until they get comfortable with us. Why only
   3 stars then? The speed. When I load the Zopim widget, my homepage load
   time goes from 6.5s to 12.3s. I can't have visitors waiting that long
   for our homepage to load. I could live with adding a second or so to
   our load, but 6 additional seconds is a deal-breaker.

Reviews

Does just what I need it to. Sorry to see it close.

   Look, I realize this happens with a thriving open-source ecosystem:
   developers come and go. Plugins are maintained for years, and then
   finally the people who maintain them have to bid adieu. I get it. But
   if someone decides to take FD Feedburner on, I'm prepared to kick in
   coffee money. üôÇ
