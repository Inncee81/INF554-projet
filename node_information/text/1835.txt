   Press release

Arms Trade Treaty enters into force

     * English
     * اردو

   Foreign Office Minister Tobias Ellwood marks the entry into force of
   the Arms Trade Treaty.
   Published 24 December 2014

   From:
          Foreign & Commonwealth Office and The Rt Hon Tobias Ellwood MP

   This was published under the 2010 to 2015 Conservative and Liberal
   Democrat coalition government
   placeholder

   Foreign Office Minister Tobias Ellwood said:

     Today marks an important moment in history. The culmination of many
     years of hard work across the world, comes to fruition with the
     entry into force of the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT). This Treaty sets
     common international standards for arms export controls, and puts
     international law and human rights at the heart of the global arms
     trade. The ATT has the real potential to reduce human suffering, and
     increase security across the globe.

     The United Kingdom has led efforts to secure the ATT from the start.
     In 2006, we were one of seven states to co-author the original UN
     Resolution calling for the creation of the Treaty, following years
     of hard work by civil society, to promote action to improve global
     controls on the trade and movement of arms. In the eight intervening
     years, we have continued to play a central role supporting the
     negotiation of the Treaty. The United Kingdom has signed, ratified,
     and has been applying the standards of the ATT since April this
     year. We regularly encourage other states to join us in this
     commitment.

     We remain committed because the ATT matters. Today, the ATT becomes
     legally binding on those who have ratified it. That is a huge
     milestone. This is the first legally binding instrument to regulate
     the trade in conventional arms. Conventional weapons kill hundreds
     of thousands of people every year. If all states follow the
     principles in the ATT, we can drastically reduce these deaths.

     It is important that this Treaty makes a lasting difference. We
     encourage all states to sign up to the Treaty. The ATT will grow
     stronger with every state that becomes a part of it and we want it
     to be truly universal. Of course, the ATT will only work if states
     do what they sign up to do. The United Kingdom already operates one
     of the world’s most robust, rigorous and transparent export
     licensing systems. We can and will share information, best practice
     and assistance with other states, which do not as yet have such
     extensive controls.

     For now, though, let me end by celebrating where we are today. We
     are now one step closer to enshrining human rights principles into
     the global arms trade: one step closer, perhaps, to reflecting the
     ethos of the season.

   The UK will leave the EU on 31 October. This page tells you how to
   prepare for Brexit. It will be updated if anything changes, including
   if a deal is agreed.

   Sign up for email alerts to get the latest information.

   Trade agreements that the UK is part of as an EU member state will no
   longer apply if there’s a no-deal Brexit.

   The UK government is working on new agreements to replace EU trade
   agreements after Brexit.

   This page lists trade agreements that:
     * have been signed and will take effect as soon as the UK leaves the
       EU

   or
     * are still under discussion

   Some new agreements will not be in place before the UK leaves the EU.
   Trade will then take place on World Trade Organization (WTO) terms.

Trade agreements that have been signed

   Agreements with the following countries and trading blocs will take
   effect when the UK leaves the EU:
     * Andean countries
     * CARIFORUM trade bloc
     * Central America
     * Chile
     * Eastern and Southern Africa (ESA) trade bloc 
     * Faroe Islands

     * Palestinian Authority

   A trade agreement with the Southern Africa Customs Union and Mozambique
   (SACU+M) trade bloc has been agreed in principle. We expect to sign the
   agreement with SACU+M shortly.

Trade agreements still in discussion

   The agreements still under discussion are listed below.

   If the UK leaves the EU without these agreements in place trade with
   these countries will take place under WTO rules.

Mutual recognition agreements

   Australia, New Zealand and United States have signed mutual recognition
   agreements.

   Discussions with Japan on a UK-Japan MRA are ongoing. The UK and Japan
   have signed an exchange of letters designed to ensure the continuity of
   existing arrangements as a temporary measure.

   A mutual recognition agreement is one in which countries recognise one
   another’s conformity assessments. When conformity assessments are
   applied to products, they are tested to an established performance
   standard. Inspections, quality management, surveillance, accreditation
   and declarations of conformity also take place.

   Delivering the deal negotiated with the EU remains the government’s top
   priority. This has not changed.

   However, the government must prepare for every eventuality, including a
   no deal scenario. For 2 years, the government has been implementing a
   significant programme of work to ensure that the UK is prepared to
   leave the EU on 29 March 2019.

   It has always been the case that as we get nearer to that date,
   preparations for a no deal scenario would have to be accelerated. We
   must ensure plans are in place should they need to be relied upon.

   In the summer, the government published a series of 106 technical
   notices setting out information to allow businesses and citizens to
   understand what they would need to do in a no deal scenario so they can
   make informed plans and preparations.

   This technical notice offers guidance for continued planning in the
   event of no deal.

   Also included is an ​overarching framing notice​ explaining the
   government’s approach to preparing the UK for this outcome in order to
   minimise disruption and ensure a smooth and orderly exit.

   We are working with the devolved administrations on technical notices
   and we will continue to do so as plans develop.

Overview

   If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, British passport holders will
   be considered third country nationals by countries within the Schengen
   area after 29 March 2019.

   If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, new rules will apply. You
   should check your passport meets these rules and renew it if necessary.

   The following countries are within the Schengen area: Austria, Belgium,
   the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece,
   Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg,
   Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia,
   Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.

   For countries that are in the EU but not in the Schengen area, you’ll
   need to check the entry requirements for the country you’re travelling
   to before you travel. These countries are Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and
   Romania. Travel to Ireland is subject to separate Common Travel Area
   arrangements which will remain the same after the UK leaves the EU.

Before 29 March 2019

   Most EU countries (though not the UK) are members of the Schengen
   Agreement. This agreement removes passport checks and border controls
   at the borders between Schengen area. People can travel around the area
   as if it is one country.

   If you’re a British citizen, as an EU national, you’re currently able
   to enter the Schengen area if you have a valid passport. There’s no
   requirement for British passports to have a minimum or maximum validity
   period remaining when you enter or leave the Schengen area.

After 29 March 2019

   If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, British passport holders,
   including passports issued by the Crown Dependencies and Gibraltar,
   you’ll be considered a third country national under the Schengen Border
   Code. This means you’ll need to comply with different rules to enter
   and travel around the Schengen area. Third-country nationals are
   citizens of countries which do not belong to the EU or the European
   Economic Area, such as Australia, Canada and the USA

   According to the Schengen Border Code, third country passports must:
     * have been issued within the last 10 years on the date of arrival in
       a Schengen country, and
     * have at least 3 months’ validity remaining on the date of intended
       departure from the last country visited in the Schengen area.
       Because third country nationals can remain in the Schengen area for
       90 days (approximately 3 months), the actual check carried out
       could be that the passport has at least 6 months validity remaining
       on the date of arrival.

   If you plan to travel to the Schengen area after 29 March 2019, we
   suggest that you check the issue date and make sure your passport is no
   older than 9 years and 6 months on the day of travel. For example, if
   you’re planning to travel to the Schengen area on 30 March 2019, your
   passport should have an issue date on or after 1 October 2009. This is
   to avoid any possibility of your adult British passport not complying
   with the Schengen Border Code.

   If your passport does not meet the criteria for third country
   nationals, you may be denied entry to any of the Schengen area
   countries, and you should renew your passport before you travel.

   The easiest way to renew your passport is online, or you can find out
   about other ways of applying to renew your passport.

   If you’re planning travel after 29 March 2019 and your passport will
   not meet these validity rules, we recommend you consider renewing your
   passport soon to avoid any delay.

If you are a parent or guardian

   For 5-year child passports issued to under-16s, check the expiry date
   and make sure there will be at least 6 months validity remaining on the
   date of travel. For example, a child planning to travel to the Schengen
   area on 30 March 2019 should have a passport with an expiry date on or
   after 1 October 2019.

   If a child’s passport does not meet the criteria for third country
   nationals, they may be denied entry to any of the Schengen area
   countries and you should renew their passport before travel.

   The easiest way to renew a child’s passport is online, or you can find
   out about other ways of applying to renew a child’s passport.

Travelling to countries which are in the EU but not in the Schengen area

   For countries that are in the EU but not in the Schengen area, you’ll
   need to check the entry requirements for the country you’re travelling
   to before you travel.

Travel to Ireland after EU exit

   Travel to Ireland is subject to separate Common Travel Area
   arrangements which will remain the same after the UK leaves the EU.

   Further details on travel to Ireland can be found on GOV.UK.

Passports with validity over 10 years (5 years for children)

   Since 2001, some adult British passports were issued with a validity
   longer than 10 years. If you renewed your passport before it expired,
   you were allowed to have the time left on your old passport added to
   your new passport. The maximum validity period possible was 10 years
   and 9 months. This means you can’t use the expiry date to check if your
   adult passport will be valid under the new rules.

   Since the beginning of September 2018, extra validity was no longer
   added to passports. The maximum validity for an adult UK passport is
   now 10 years, and 5 years for a child passport. We have made this
   change to follow recommendations set out by the International Civil
   Aviation Organisation and to provide clarity about passport validity in
   the future.

Crown Dependencies and Gibraltar passports

   These new rules will also apply to you if your British passport is a
   Crown Dependency or Gibraltar issued passport and you’re going to
   travel to a country in the Schengen Area from 30 March 2019. If your
   passport does not meet these criteria, you may be denied entry to
   Schengen area countries and you should renew your passport before you
   travel.

   You can apply for a new passport at your respective Crown Dependencies
   or Gibraltar passport offices:
     * Gibraltar
     * Guernsey
     * Isle of Man
     * Jersey

British passports issued after 29 March 2019

   The design of the British passport will change after Britain leaves the
   EU. This will happen in two stages.

   Passports printed between 30 March 2019 up until the introduction of
   the new passport design will be burgundy but will not include the words
   ‘European Union’ on the front cover. This includes passports issued by
   the Crown Dependencies and Gibraltar.

   Blue passports will start being issued from late 2019.

   If you renew your passport between late 2019 and early 2020, you’ll be
   automatically issued with either a blue or burgundy British passport.

   This notice is meant for guidance only. You should consider whether you
   need separate professional advice before making specific preparations.

   It is part of the government’s ongoing programme of planning for all
   possible outcomes. We expect to negotiate a successful deal with the
   EU.

   The UK government is clear that in this scenario we must respect our
   unique relationship with Ireland, with whom we share a land border and
   who are co-signatories of the Belfast Agreement. The UK government has
   consistently placed upholding the Agreement and its successors at the
   heart of our approach. It enshrines the consent principle on which
   Northern Ireland’s constitutional status rests. We recognise the basis
   it has provided for the deep economic and social cooperation on the
   island of Ireland. This includes North-South cooperation between
   Northern Ireland and Ireland, which we’re committed to protecting in
   line with the letter and spirit of Strand two of the Agreement.

   The Irish government have indicated they would need to discuss
   arrangements in the event of no deal with the European Commission and
   EU Member States. The UK would stand ready in this scenario to engage
   constructively to meet our commitments and act in the best interests of
   the people of Northern Ireland, recognising the very significant
   challenges that the lack of a UK-EU legal agreement would pose in this
   unique and highly sensitive context.

   It remains, though, the responsibility of the UK government, as the
   sovereign government in Northern Ireland, to continue preparations for
   the full range of potential outcomes, including no deal. As we do, and
   as decisions are made, we’ll take full account of the unique
   circumstances of Northern Ireland.

   Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein are party to the Agreement on the
   European Economic Area and participate in other EU arrangements. As
   such, in many areas, these countries adopt EU rules. Where this is the
   case, these technical notices may also apply to them, and EEA
   businesses and citizens should consider whether they need to take any
   steps to prepare for a ‘no deal’ scenario.

   Press release

Arms Trade Treaty enters into force

     * English
     * اردو

   Foreign Office Minister Tobias Ellwood marks the entry into force of
   the Arms Trade Treaty.
   Published 24 December 2014

   From:
          Foreign & Commonwealth Office and The Rt Hon Tobias Ellwood MP

   This was published under the 2010 to 2015 Conservative and Liberal
   Democrat coalition government
   placeholder

   Foreign Office Minister Tobias Ellwood said:

     Today marks an important moment in history. The culmination of many
     years of hard work across the world, comes to fruition with the
     entry into force of the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT). This Treaty sets
     common international standards for arms export controls, and puts
     international law and human rights at the heart of the global arms
     trade. The ATT has the real potential to reduce human suffering, and
     increase security across the globe.

     The United Kingdom has led efforts to secure the ATT from the start.
     In 2006, we were one of seven states to co-author the original UN
     Resolution calling for the creation of the Treaty, following years
     of hard work by civil society, to promote action to improve global
     controls on the trade and movement of arms. In the eight intervening
     years, we have continued to play a central role supporting the
     negotiation of the Treaty. The United Kingdom has signed, ratified,
     and has been applying the standards of the ATT since April this
     year. We regularly encourage other states to join us in this
     commitment.

     We remain committed because the ATT matters. Today, the ATT becomes
     legally binding on those who have ratified it. That is a huge
     milestone. This is the first legally binding instrument to regulate
     the trade in conventional arms. Conventional weapons kill hundreds
     of thousands of people every year. If all states follow the
     principles in the ATT, we can drastically reduce these deaths.

     It is important that this Treaty makes a lasting difference. We
     encourage all states to sign up to the Treaty. The ATT will grow
     stronger with every state that becomes a part of it and we want it
     to be truly universal. Of course, the ATT will only work if states
     do what they sign up to do. The United Kingdom already operates one
     of the world’s most robust, rigorous and transparent export
     licensing systems. We can and will share information, best practice
     and assistance with other states, which do not as yet have such
     extensive controls.

     For now, though, let me end by celebrating where we are today. We
     are now one step closer to enshrining human rights principles into
     the global arms trade: one step closer, perhaps, to reflecting the
     ethos of the season.

   The UK will leave the EU on 31 October. This page tells you how to
   prepare for Brexit. It will be updated if anything changes, including
   if a deal is agreed.

   Sign up for email alerts to get the latest information.

   Trade agreements that the UK is part of as an EU member state will no
   longer apply if there’s a no-deal Brexit.

   The UK government is working on new agreements to replace EU trade
   agreements after Brexit.

   This page lists trade agreements that:
     * have been signed and will take effect as soon as the UK leaves the
       EU

   or
     * are still under discussion

   Some new agreements will not be in place before the UK leaves the EU.
   Trade will then take place on World Trade Organization (WTO) terms.

Trade agreements that have been signed

   Agreements with the following countries and trading blocs will take
   effect when the UK leaves the EU:
     * Andean countries
     * CARIFORUM trade bloc
     * Central America
     * Chile
     * Eastern and Southern Africa (ESA) trade bloc 
     * Faroe Islands

     * Israel
     * Lebanon
     * Liechtenstein
     * Pacific states
     * Palestinian Authority
     * South Korea

   A trade agreement with the Southern Africa Customs Union and Mozambique
   (SACU+M) trade bloc has been agreed in principle. We expect to sign the
   agreement with SACU+M shortly.

Trade agreements still in discussion

   The agreements still under discussion are listed below.

   If the UK leaves the EU without these agreements in place trade with
   these countries will take place under WTO rules.

Mutual recognition agreements

   Australia, New Zealand and United States have signed mutual recognition
   agreements.

   Discussions with Japan on a UK-Japan MRA are ongoing. The UK and Japan
   have signed an exchange of letters designed to ensure the continuity of
   existing arrangements as a temporary measure.

   A mutual recognition agreement is one in which countries recognise one
   another’s conformity assessments. When conformity assessments are
   applied to products, they are tested to an established performance
   standard. Inspections, quality management, surveillance, accreditation
   and declarations of conformity also take place.

   Delivering the deal negotiated with the EU remains the government’s top
   priority. This has not changed.

   However, the government must prepare for every eventuality, including a
   no deal scenario. For 2 years, the government has been implementing a
   significant programme of work to ensure that the UK is prepared to
   leave the EU on 29 March 2019.

   It has always been the case that as we get nearer to that date,
   preparations for a no deal scenario would have to be accelerated. We
   must ensure plans are in place should they need to be relied upon.

   In the summer, the government published a series of 106 technical
   notices setting out information to allow businesses and citizens to
   understand what they would need to do in a no deal scenario so they can
   make informed plans and preparations.

   This technical notice offers guidance for continued planning in the
   event of no deal.

   Also included is an ​overarching framing notice​ explaining the
   government’s approach to preparing the UK for this outcome in order to
   minimise disruption and ensure a smooth and orderly exit.

   We are working with the devolved administrations on technical notices
   and we will continue to do so as plans develop.

Overview

   If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, British passport holders will
   be considered third country nationals by countries within the Schengen
   area after 29 March 2019.

   If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, new rules will apply. You
   should check your passport meets these rules and renew it if necessary.

   The following countries are within the Schengen area: Austria, Belgium,
   the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece,
   Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg,
   Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia,
   Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.

   For countries that are in the EU but not in the Schengen area, you’ll
   need to check the entry requirements for the country you’re travelling
   to before you travel. These countries are Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and
   Romania. Travel to Ireland is subject to separate Common Travel Area
   arrangements which will remain the same after the UK leaves the EU.

Before 29 March 2019

   Most EU countries (though not the UK) are members of the Schengen
   Agreement. This agreement removes passport checks and border controls
   at the borders between Schengen area. People can travel around the area
   as if it is one country.

   If you’re a British citizen, as an EU national, you’re currently able
   to enter the Schengen area if you have a valid passport. There’s no
   requirement for British passports to have a minimum or maximum validity
   period remaining when you enter or leave the Schengen area.

After 29 March 2019

   If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, British passport holders,
   including passports issued by the Crown Dependencies and Gibraltar,
   you’ll be considered a third country national under the Schengen Border
   Code. This means you’ll need to comply with different rules to enter
   and travel around the Schengen area. Third-country nationals are
   citizens of countries which do not belong to the EU or the European
   Economic Area, such as Australia, Canada and the USA

   According to the Schengen Border Code, third country passports must:
     * have been issued within the last 10 years on the date of arrival in
       a Schengen country, and
     * have at least 3 months’ validity remaining on the date of intended
       departure from the last country visited in the Schengen area.
       Because third country nationals can remain in the Schengen area for
       90 days (approximately 3 months), the actual check carried out
       could be that the passport has at least 6 months validity remaining
       on the date of arrival.

   If you plan to travel to the Schengen area after 29 March 2019, we
   suggest that you check the issue date and make sure your passport is no
   older than 9 years and 6 months on the day of travel. For example, if
   you’re planning to travel to the Schengen area on 30 March 2019, your
   passport should have an issue date on or after 1 October 2009. This is
   to avoid any possibility of your adult British passport not complying
   with the Schengen Border Code.

   If your passport does not meet the criteria for third country
   nationals, you may be denied entry to any of the Schengen area
   countries, and you should renew your passport before you travel.

   The easiest way to renew your passport is online, or you can find out
   about other ways of applying to renew your passport.

   If you’re planning travel after 29 March 2019 and your passport will
   not meet these validity rules, we recommend you consider renewing your
   passport soon to avoid any delay.

If you are a parent or guardian

   For 5-year child passports issued to under-16s, check the expiry date
   and make sure there will be at least 6 months validity remaining on the
   date of travel. For example, a child planning to travel to the Schengen
   area on 30 March 2019 should have a passport with an expiry date on or
   after 1 October 2019.

   If a child’s passport does not meet the criteria for third country
   nationals, they may be denied entry to any of the Schengen area
   countries and you should renew their passport before travel.

   The easiest way to renew a child’s passport is online, or you can find
   out about other ways of applying to renew a child’s passport.

Travelling to countries which are in the EU but not in the Schengen area

   For countries that are in the EU but not in the Schengen area, you’ll
   need to check the entry requirements for the country you’re travelling
   to before you travel.

Travel to Ireland after EU exit

   Travel to Ireland is subject to separate Common Travel Area
   arrangements which will remain the same after the UK leaves the EU.

   Further details on travel to Ireland can be found on GOV.UK.

Passports with validity over 10 years (5 years for children)

   Since 2001, some adult British passports were issued with a validity
   longer than 10 years. If you renewed your passport before it expired,
   you were allowed to have the time left on your old passport added to
   your new passport. The maximum validity period possible was 10 years
   and 9 months. This means you can’t use the expiry date to check if your
   adult passport will be valid under the new rules.

   Since the beginning of September 2018, extra validity was no longer
   added to passports. The maximum validity for an adult UK passport is
   now 10 years, and 5 years for a child passport. We have made this
   change to follow recommendations set out by the International Civil
   Aviation Organisation and to provide clarity about passport validity in
   the future.

Crown Dependencies and Gibraltar passports

   These new rules will also apply to you if your British passport is a
   Crown Dependency or Gibraltar issued passport and you’re going to
   travel to a country in the Schengen Area from 30 March 2019. If your
   passport does not meet these criteria, you may be denied entry to
   Schengen area countries and you should renew your passport before you
   travel.

   You can apply for a new passport at your respective Crown Dependencies
   or Gibraltar passport offices:
     * Gibraltar
     * Guernsey
     * Isle of Man
     * Jersey

British passports issued after 29 March 2019

   The design of the British passport will change after Britain leaves the
   EU. This will happen in two stages.

   Passports printed between 30 March 2019 up until the introduction of
   the new passport design will be burgundy but will not include the words
   ‘European Union’ on the front cover. This includes passports issued by
   the Crown Dependencies and Gibraltar.

   Blue passports will start being issued from late 2019.

   If you renew your passport between late 2019 and early 2020, you’ll be
   automatically issued with either a blue or burgundy British passport.

   This notice is meant for guidance only. You should consider whether you
   need separate professional advice before making specific preparations.

   It is part of the government’s ongoing programme of planning for all
   possible outcomes. We expect to negotiate a successful deal with the
   EU.

   The UK government is clear that in this scenario we must respect our
   unique relationship with Ireland, with whom we share a land border and
   who are co-signatories of the Belfast Agreement. The UK government has
   consistently placed upholding the Agreement and its successors at the
   heart of our approach. It enshrines the consent principle on which
   Northern Ireland’s constitutional status rests. We recognise the basis
   it has provided for the deep economic and social cooperation on the
   island of Ireland. This includes North-South cooperation between
   Northern Ireland and Ireland, which we’re committed to protecting in
   line with the letter and spirit of Strand two of the Agreement.

   The Irish government have indicated they would need to discuss
   arrangements in the event of no deal with the European Commission and
   EU Member States. The UK would stand ready in this scenario to engage
   constructively to meet our commitments and act in the best interests of
   the people of Northern Ireland, recognising the very significant
   challenges that the lack of a UK-EU legal agreement would pose in this
   unique and highly sensitive context.

   It remains, though, the responsibility of the UK government, as the
   sovereign government in Northern Ireland, to continue preparations for
   the full range of potential outcomes, including no deal. As we do, and
   as decisions are made, we’ll take full account of the unique
   circumstances of Northern Ireland.

   Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein are party to the Agreement on the
   European Economic Area and participate in other EU arrangements. As
   such, in many areas, these countries adopt EU rules. Where this is the
   case, these technical notices may also apply to them, and EEA
   businesses and citizens should consider whether they need to take any
   steps to prepare for a ‘no deal’ scenario.
