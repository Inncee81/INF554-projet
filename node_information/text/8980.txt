Boston Cannabis Week: Photos

   <p>“I’m blessed to be here, as a Black woman entrepreneur who just
   started her business in February. It’s hard and you’re constantly
   taking in a lot of people’s energy…you also need to practice self-care.
   There’s this mindset that it’s better to work for yourself and make
   your own money but you have to pay your rent — so you have to do all of
   these other jobs to survive. It’s hard but it’s an amazing journey and
   I will never, ever quit.”</p> <p>“Our lab is based out of Framingham.
   We test for anyone who’s interested in finding out more about their
   cannabis products of adult age in Massachusetts. If you’re a home
   grower or you’re making edibles, we can tell you more information about
   the potency, certify the safety, the purity of the products that are
   being made and consumed. From a personal standpoint, I’ve experienced
   the benefits of cannabis both recreationally and medically. I’m a
   diabetic and it helps to modulate blood glucose amongst other things.
   While Massachusetts has taken the lead to be the first state to take
   these initiatives, there’s a long way to go when it comes to
   actualizing the vision.”</p> <p>“We are a women founded nonprofit
   designed to improve diversity and inclusion inside the cannabis
   industry through education, networking and events. As we’re building
   regulations as it pertains to cannabis, there are certain conversations
   that need to be had to make sure that they are fair, structured and
   helpful. Realistically, the drug war was most harmful to communities of
   color. We need to make a very concerted effort to encourage those
   particular populations to take leadership roles and become business
   owners so we can not only improve diversity, but to give back after the
   damage that was done.” – Cara Brabb Burnham, cofounder, ELEVATE
   Northeast </p>

Masked Country Star Orville Peck Kicks Off North American Tour

   <p>Signed to Nirvana’s old record label and partially hidden beneath a

   sort of deep-voiced singer whose music evokes the surrealism of David
   Lynch as much as the baritoned boom of Johnny Cash. We caught up with
   him at the Music Hall of Williamsburg on September 20, 2019 for the

Boston Cannabis Week: Photos

   <p>“I’m blessed to be here, as a Black woman entrepreneur who just
   started her business in February. It’s hard and you’re constantly
   taking in a lot of people’s energy…you also need to practice self-care.
   There’s this mindset that it’s better to work for yourself and make
   your own money but you have to pay your rent — so you have to do all of
   these other jobs to survive. It’s hard but it’s an amazing journey and
   I will never, ever quit.”</p> <p>“Our lab is based out of Framingham.
   We test for anyone who’s interested in finding out more about their
   cannabis products of adult age in Massachusetts. If you’re a home
   grower or you’re making edibles, we can tell you more information about
   the potency, certify the safety, the purity of the products that are
   being made and consumed. From a personal standpoint, I’ve experienced
   the benefits of cannabis both recreationally and medically. I’m a
   diabetic and it helps to modulate blood glucose amongst other things.
   While Massachusetts has taken the lead to be the first state to take
   these initiatives, there’s a long way to go when it comes to
   actualizing the vision.”</p> <p>“We are a women founded nonprofit
   designed to improve diversity and inclusion inside the cannabis
   industry through education, networking and events. As we’re building
   regulations as it pertains to cannabis, there are certain conversations
   that need to be had to make sure that they are fair, structured and
   helpful. Realistically, the drug war was most harmful to communities of
   color. We need to make a very concerted effort to encourage those
   particular populations to take leadership roles and become business
   owners so we can not only improve diversity, but to give back after the
   damage that was done.” – Cara Brabb Burnham, cofounder, ELEVATE

   Dove Cameron

   Dove Cameron got her start on Disney, starring in the sitcom 'Liv and
   Maddie'.

   Blythe Thomas

   Dove Cameron knows people have never been sure what to make of her. The
   23-year-old got her start on Disney, starring in the sitcom Liv and
   Maddie before helming the musical film franchise Descendants, in which
   she played Maleficent’s daughter. While she thrived on the platform,
   her life and celebrity felt separate from the entertainment engine for
   which she was working.

   “I always felt like I was an actress-for-hire rather than a brand
   ambassador or a ‘Disney kid,’” she says bluntly. When Descendants 3
   aired earlier this summer, her final appearance in the franchise, the
   feeling of something being “severed” came as a shock. “When it ended, I
   really didn’t anticipate having any sort of emotional page turn.”

   What seemed to affect her more was public perception, especially as she
   was in the midst of figuring out her next move. “A lot of people had
   more ideas about me than even I had about myself,” she says, laughing.
   Cameron admits that her own personal preferences and image never helped
   the image placed on her.

   “I happen to look quite clean, and I happen to not be interested in
   things that we would typically call ‘inappropriate,’ like things that
   might be bad for the brand,” she explains, referring to the impulse by
   past Disney stars to be rebellious. “I just happened to be one of those
   people that wasn’t naturally inclined to behave like that.”

Disney Star Dove Cameron Launches Music Career With Solitary 'Waste' Video

How Debby Ryan Survived Teen Disney Stardom With Her Career Intact

   As she came close to the end of her time with the company, Cameron
   realized she craved creativity, something that made her feel more like
   a participant, more than a watcher within the industry. So, after
   signing with Disruptor/Columbia Records, she explored other options and
   began working in the studio with seasoned writers and producers like
   the Orphanage, Jonas Jeberg, Delacey, Carly Paige Waldrip, and Chloe
   Angelides. Together, they cooked up a “pretty meaty collection” of
   songs she’s beginning to release. Dreamy, rock-tinged love song “Waste”
   and the darker, synthy break-up opus “Bloodshot” — both released last
   week — are the long-awaited taste of the new Dove Cameron, the real
   Dove Cameron.

   “I do get the sense that I can feel a little bit far away from even my
   fans I have now, and I don’t know if that’s because of a highly glossy
   image,” she says. “I do think this music opens up more of who I really
   am.”

   For both, Cameron wanted to approach stereotypical coming-of-age
   feelings from fresh angles. On “Waste,” a song she describes as one of
   her absolute favorites, she wanted to step away from the “melty,
   dripping, sappy love songs” she tends to loathe.

   “It’s more about the dire effects that happen to you when you’re
   massively in love with someone all of a sudden,” she explains further,
   “and the chemicals that get released and the feeling of suffering
   something so delicious.”

   On the opposite end, “Bloodshot” was originally inspired by some boy
   problems Cameron’s co-writer Waldrip had been experiencing, but the
   goal was to keep the actual meaning more open-ended.

   “I tend to really hate a break-up song,” she admits. “It’s more about
   the feeling of losing someone. It could be about a death or a
   friendship loss.”

   For the time being, Cameron is shifting her entire focus to music. A
   third new song may arrive soon, she explains, and she plans on filming
   proper videos for each single. To help aid that plan, she’s avoiding
   the commitment of any television series; following her appearances in
   the off-Broadway adaptation Clueless: The Musical and a London
   production of The Light in the Piazza, she’s steering clear of her
   accidental detour into musical theater. Hopefully, the next time she
   will be on stage, she’ll be performing her original songs.

   “I feel all of a sudden like I’ve come down to reality,” Cameron
   concludes. “I feel more grounded and human than ever.”
