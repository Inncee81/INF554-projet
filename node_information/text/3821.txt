Goofs

   Alex's brain scan in the film is referred to as an "MRI." This imaging
   modality is commonly used on athletes who need to have the extent of
   tissue damage visualized by a radiologist. Alex was studied with "fMRI"
   or functional MRI, which follows localized blood flow in the range of
   seconds which increases with increased neural activity. The
   interpretation presented in the film suggests Alex had a decreased
   response to fearful stimuli (pictures of sinking ships, knives, etc.)
   since there doesn't appear to be increased activity in the amygdala as
   compared to other subjects considered to be "normal." See more »

   Death-defying feat will leave you stunned
   20 October 2018 | by paul-allaer – See all my reviews

   "Free Solo" (2018 release; 96 min.) is a bio-pick about Alex Honnold
   and his historic 2017 climb of Yosemite's El Capitan. As the movie
   open, we see Alex in the later stage of that climb, and the images
   immediately will cause you to gasp. We then go back to "Spring 2016",
   when Alex is doing a book tour and comments about why he does what he
   does. "Chances of falling off are low, but the consequences are high",
   he wryly observes. Ater a few minutes recapping Alex's upbringing, it
   isn't long before the movie centers on El Capitan, "the center of the
   rock-climbing universe"... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie,
   you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.
   Couple of comments: this is the latest documentary from (real life
   couple) Jimmy Chan and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi, who previously
   brought us the equally excellent "Meru", one of my favorite movies of
   2014. Here they document the extraordinary feat accomplished by Alex
   Hannold of conquering the 3,200 ft. El Capitan. While the movie does
   well putting everything into the proper context, in particular Alex's
   budding relationship with his new girlfriend, what makes this so
   remarkable is that we, the audience at large (whom I suspect are not
   experts in rock climbing, let alone free solo climbing) are shown how
   technical and challenging it is to climb up El Capitan, let alone doing
   it free solo. Alex does many trial runs to grasp and master the most
   difficult parts of the climb. The last half hour brings us the actual
   free solo climb (on June 3, 2017), and even though we know the outcome
   (Alex lives!), it is still stupefying and almost impossible to watch (I
   admit I covered my eyes on a number of occasions). There are simply no
   words for it.
   "Free Solo" opened in late September in limited release, and
   immediately caused a sensation. The movie finally opened at my local
   art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and I couldn't wait to see it.
   The Friday evening screening where I saw this at was PACKED to the
   rafters in the largest room of the 6 screen theater, something I
   haven't seen in YEARS. The movie is going to be a box office smash in
   the art-house theater circuit, and sure to be nominated for a Best
   Documentary Oscar. Whether you have any interest in rock climbing or
   not, if you want to see one of the greatest human achievements in
   sports or you are a thrill-seeker, I'd readily suggest you check this
   out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and
   draw your own conclusion.

Storyline

   Lee Israel (Melissa McCarthy) made her living in the 1970s and '80s
   profiling the likes of Katharine Hepburn, Tallulah Bankhead, Estee
   Lauder and journalist Dorothy Kilgallen. When Lee is no longer able to
   get published because she has fallen out of step with current tastes,
   she turns her art form to deception, abetted by her loyal friend Jack
   (Richard E. Grant). An adaptation of the memoir "Can You Ever Forgive
   Me?" relays the true story of the best-selling celebrity biographer
   (and friend to cats). Written by Fox Searchlight Pictures

Alternate Versions

   Ahead of the film's release in Australia, the distributor chose to
   pre-cut the film in order to obtain an M classification. These changes
   removed detail of hard drug misuse (cocaine snorting) through
   re-framing, and also removed the film's sole use of very strong
   language by re-dubbing the term with a milder phrase. The uncut
   international version was later approved for a DVD/Video release with
   an uncut MA15+ classification. See more »

   GRADE: B
   THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.
   IN BRIEF: Two great performances enhance a true tale about breaking the
   law.
   JIM'S REVIEW: Lee Israel is a down-on-her-luck misanthropic writer who
   admittingly "likes cats more than people" and drink excessively. No one
   is interested in her novels, no one cares about her either. She is a
   sad lonely woman who isolates herself from the world and the world
   seems to prefer it that way too. Forced to survive, Lee decides that
   becoming a literary forger, complete with dead celebrity signatures,
   may actually be a more profitable vocation. Played with total honesty
   and conviction by Melissa McCartney, she becomes a most compelling
   character of worth in this fact-based biography, Can You Ever Forgive
   Me?
   Solidly directed by Marielle Heller and with a literate screenplay by
   Nicole Holofcener and Jeff Whitty that captures the 90's sensibilities
   very well, the film spends a great deal of time establishing Lee's
   self-enforced exile from the human race and her get-rich scheme. The
   storytelling becomes a tad monotonous and is more leisurely paced than
   necessary. But the true life story of an author unable to cope with the
   harsh realities of life is always a fascinating subject.
   And Ms. McCartney is a wonder, showing the full gamut of emotion. She
   restrains her great comic prowess and exchanges it for genuine pathos
   and vulnerability. Never allowing her character to become overly
   sympathetic or too much a victim, Ms. McCartney makes Lee a pathetic
   yet shrewd criminal. Abetting Lee is her partner-in-crime, a
   flamboyantly gay Jack Hoch. Richard E. Grant is superb as her only
   friend and carefree accomplice. These two misfits become a wonderful
   tag team and bring much nuance to their well written roles. They are
   both deserving of award consideration. Fine support also comes from its
   strong cast which includes Dolly Wells, Stephen Spinella, Ben Falcone,
   Anna Deavera Smith, and Jane Curtain as Lee's frustrated agent.
   Can You Ever Forgive Me? is a nicely honed character study that
   provides an acting showcase for the talented Ms. M. who hopefully will
   have more dramatic opportunities in her future cinematic ventures.

   Early 1970s. Four strangers check in at the El Royale Hotel. The hotel

Goofs

   The bugs are too small for 1969 technology. So is the telescoping
   magnet in the tool kit. The foam pad for the tools is a type not

   Good times had seeing Bad Times
   13 October 2018 | by jg_1977 – See all my reviews

   First off let me say, Bat Times at the El Royale is most certainly not
   for everyone. The way the story unfolds and how information is
   withheld/presented is quite complex. Although this may make it a bit
   too convoluted for some, it makes it an absolute treat for anyone
   willing to dig beneath the surface and get analytical. Not unlike Cabin
   in the Woods (Drew Goddard's directorial debut), Bad Times plays with
   your expectations. Goddard takes painstaking care to build tension
   throughout a scene, only to have it all upended by a sudden twist. For
   that reason, I anticipate the reaction to this film will be divided, as
   many moviegoers simply don't like surprises or being unsure of what
   will happen. However, if you are a fan of Goddard's previous work, it's
   a safe bet that you'll like this one. I also need to talk about the
   cast, as they deliver an absolute treasure of an ensemble performance.
   Each person plays their part incredibly well, but Cynthia Erivo and
   Chris Hemsworth are the definite stand outs. Hemsworth especially
   shines, showing us that he can do more than play a quippy Norse god.
   This movie has so much to unpack both visually and in terms of
   foreshadowing that I cannot wait to see it again. If you're looking for
   a smart, stylish, and generally thrilling way to spend a few hours,
   look no further than Bad Times at the El Royale.

   Jupiter: Ten centuries ago, before the Age of Obedience, free dogs

   in force upon the unwary four-legged beasts. On the eve of total canine
   annihilation, a child warrior sympathetic to the plight of the besieged
   underdog dogs, betrayed his species, beheaded the head of the head of
   the Kobayashi clan, and pledged his sword with the following battle-cry

   Another Wes Anderson masterpiece!
   24 November 2018 | by paulclaassen – See all my reviews

   I love Wes Anderson's films and I love animation films. 'Isle of Dogs'
   was absolutely incredible! It is a demented, unsympathetic and uniquely
   different film that is completely and utterly stunning! The stop-motion
   animation is great. The script and dialogue is very good, and you gotta
   love the (dog) characters!
   The film featured some moments that had me belly-laughing and moments
   that just melted my heart. It never became sentimental or overly
   comical. The comedic moments were seriously funny. Wes Anderson pays
   great attention to detail and he obviously had a clear vision of what
   he wanted to portray. We don't always understand what the Japanese are
   saying, as they are not accompanied by subtitles, but that never
   mattered and - in fact - made it even more interesting, funny and
   unique.
   'Isle of Dogs' will go down as one of my all-time favorite movies.

Storyline

   Six close friends meet each week for a game night involving board
   games, charades and pop culture trivia quizzes. Being the most
   competitive of the bunch, Max and his wife Annie, who seem to be a
   perfect match in every way, usually win every time. However, their
   marriage is on rocky ground as Annie fears that Max doesn't want to
   have children. When Max's shady brother Brooks reappears after a long
   mysterious absence and suggests that they have their next gathering at
   his place, no one expects that their weekly game night is about to go
   to the next level as Brooks organizes a full blown murder mystery party
   complete with actors as criminals and cops for them. However, when
   Brooks is violently kidnapped in front of everyone, it turns out that
   the game is all too real. Now, Max, Annie, their womanizing dimwitted
   friend Ryan, his domineering Irish date Sarah, and their childhood
   friends Michelle and her husband Kevin, who's obsessed with finding out
   with which mysterious celebrity ...

   Very enjoyable comedy romp
   21 February 2018 | by deonast – See all my reviews

   This was a very enjoyable comedy. Plenty of jokes hit their mark and
   the audience loved it from the laughter I heard in the session. To be
   upfront I some advanced session tickets from the Australian
   distributor, won in a competition. So we all saw it for free, but if I
   wanted to see a good comedy this one is worth paying to watch.
   The humour is good, nothing too highbrow but you won't find any crass
   humour here, just good fun throughout the film.
   The film does have its silly moments and the twists towards the end
   stretch believability, but you don't really care as you don't watch
   this film to critique, but just to enjoy the ride for a few hours. The
   characters are not deep, but you quickly grow to like them all or feel
   sorry for them as the film flows on.
   Enjoyable, good clean fun with the odd bit of blood, that is even used
   to humourous effect.

Goofs

   Alex's brain scan in the film is referred to as an "MRI." This imaging
   modality is commonly used on athletes who need to have the extent of
   tissue damage visualized by a radiologist. Alex was studied with "fMRI"
   or functional MRI, which follows localized blood flow in the range of
   seconds which increases with increased neural activity. The
   interpretation presented in the film suggests Alex had a decreased
   response to fearful stimuli (pictures of sinking ships, knives, etc.)
   since there doesn't appear to be increased activity in the amygdala as
   compared to other subjects considered to be "normal." See more »

   Death-defying feat will leave you stunned
   20 October 2018 | by paul-allaer – See all my reviews

   "Free Solo" (2018 release; 96 min.) is a bio-pick about Alex Honnold
   and his historic 2017 climb of Yosemite's El Capitan. As the movie
   open, we see Alex in the later stage of that climb, and the images
   immediately will cause you to gasp. We then go back to "Spring 2016",
   when Alex is doing a book tour and comments about why he does what he
   does. "Chances of falling off are low, but the consequences are high",
   he wryly observes. Ater a few minutes recapping Alex's upbringing, it
   isn't long before the movie centers on El Capitan, "the center of the
   rock-climbing universe"... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie,
   you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.
   Couple of comments: this is the latest documentary from (real life
   couple) Jimmy Chan and Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi, who previously
   brought us the equally excellent "Meru", one of my favorite movies of
   2014. Here they document the extraordinary feat accomplished by Alex
   Hannold of conquering the 3,200 ft. El Capitan. While the movie does
   well putting everything into the proper context, in particular Alex's
   budding relationship with his new girlfriend, what makes this so
   remarkable is that we, the audience at large (whom I suspect are not
   experts in rock climbing, let alone free solo climbing) are shown how
   technical and challenging it is to climb up El Capitan, let alone doing
   it free solo. Alex does many trial runs to grasp and master the most
   difficult parts of the climb. The last half hour brings us the actual
   free solo climb (on June 3, 2017), and even though we know the outcome
   (Alex lives!), it is still stupefying and almost impossible to watch (I
   admit I covered my eyes on a number of occasions). There are simply no
   words for it.
   "Free Solo" opened in late September in limited release, and
   immediately caused a sensation. The movie finally opened at my local
   art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and I couldn't wait to see it.
   The Friday evening screening where I saw this at was PACKED to the
   rafters in the largest room of the 6 screen theater, something I
   haven't seen in YEARS. The movie is going to be a box office smash in
   the art-house theater circuit, and sure to be nominated for a Best
   Documentary Oscar. Whether you have any interest in rock climbing or
   not, if you want to see one of the greatest human achievements in
   sports or you are a thrill-seeker, I'd readily suggest you check this
   out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and
   draw your own conclusion.

Storyline

   Lee Israel (Melissa McCarthy) made her living in the 1970s and '80s
   profiling the likes of Katharine Hepburn, Tallulah Bankhead, Estee
   Lauder and journalist Dorothy Kilgallen. When Lee is no longer able to
   get published because she has fallen out of step with current tastes,
   she turns her art form to deception, abetted by her loyal friend Jack
   (Richard E. Grant). An adaptation of the memoir "Can You Ever Forgive
   Me?" relays the true story of the best-selling celebrity biographer
   (and friend to cats). Written by Fox Searchlight Pictures

Alternate Versions

   Ahead of the film's release in Australia, the distributor chose to
   pre-cut the film in order to obtain an M classification. These changes
   removed detail of hard drug misuse (cocaine snorting) through
   re-framing, and also removed the film's sole use of very strong
   language by re-dubbing the term with a milder phrase. The uncut
   international version was later approved for a DVD/Video release with
   an uncut MA15+ classification. See more »

   GRADE: B
   THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.
   IN BRIEF: Two great performances enhance a true tale about breaking the
   law.
   JIM'S REVIEW: Lee Israel is a down-on-her-luck misanthropic writer who
   admittingly "likes cats more than people" and drink excessively. No one
   is interested in her novels, no one cares about her either. She is a
   sad lonely woman who isolates herself from the world and the world
   seems to prefer it that way too. Forced to survive, Lee decides that
   becoming a literary forger, complete with dead celebrity signatures,
   may actually be a more profitable vocation. Played with total honesty
   and conviction by Melissa McCartney, she becomes a most compelling
   character of worth in this fact-based biography, Can You Ever Forgive
   Me?
   Solidly directed by Marielle Heller and with a literate screenplay by
   Nicole Holofcener and Jeff Whitty that captures the 90's sensibilities
   very well, the film spends a great deal of time establishing Lee's
   self-enforced exile from the human race and her get-rich scheme. The
   storytelling becomes a tad monotonous and is more leisurely paced than
   necessary. But the true life story of an author unable to cope with the
   harsh realities of life is always a fascinating subject.
   And Ms. McCartney is a wonder, showing the full gamut of emotion. She
   restrains her great comic prowess and exchanges it for genuine pathos
   and vulnerability. Never allowing her character to become overly
   sympathetic or too much a victim, Ms. McCartney makes Lee a pathetic
   yet shrewd criminal. Abetting Lee is her partner-in-crime, a
   flamboyantly gay Jack Hoch. Richard E. Grant is superb as her only
   friend and carefree accomplice. These two misfits become a wonderful
   tag team and bring much nuance to their well written roles. They are
   both deserving of award consideration. Fine support also comes from its
   strong cast which includes Dolly Wells, Stephen Spinella, Ben Falcone,
   Anna Deavera Smith, and Jane Curtain as Lee's frustrated agent.
   Can You Ever Forgive Me? is a nicely honed character study that
   provides an acting showcase for the talented Ms. M. who hopefully will
   have more dramatic opportunities in her future cinematic ventures.

   Early 1970s. Four strangers check in at the El Royale Hotel. The hotel

Goofs

   The bugs are too small for 1969 technology. So is the telescoping
   magnet in the tool kit. The foam pad for the tools is a type not

   Good times had seeing Bad Times
   13 October 2018 | by jg_1977 – See all my reviews

   First off let me say, Bat Times at the El Royale is most certainly not
   for everyone. The way the story unfolds and how information is
   withheld/presented is quite complex. Although this may make it a bit
   too convoluted for some, it makes it an absolute treat for anyone
   willing to dig beneath the surface and get analytical. Not unlike Cabin
   in the Woods (Drew Goddard's directorial debut), Bad Times plays with
   your expectations. Goddard takes painstaking care to build tension
   throughout a scene, only to have it all upended by a sudden twist. For
   that reason, I anticipate the reaction to this film will be divided, as
   many moviegoers simply don't like surprises or being unsure of what
   will happen. However, if you are a fan of Goddard's previous work, it's
   a safe bet that you'll like this one. I also need to talk about the
   cast, as they deliver an absolute treasure of an ensemble performance.
   Each person plays their part incredibly well, but Cynthia Erivo and
   Chris Hemsworth are the definite stand outs. Hemsworth especially
   shines, showing us that he can do more than play a quippy Norse god.
   This movie has so much to unpack both visually and in terms of
   foreshadowing that I cannot wait to see it again. If you're looking for
   a smart, stylish, and generally thrilling way to spend a few hours,
   look no further than Bad Times at the El Royale.

   Jupiter: Ten centuries ago, before the Age of Obedience, free dogs

   in force upon the unwary four-legged beasts. On the eve of total canine
   annihilation, a child warrior sympathetic to the plight of the besieged

   Another Wes Anderson masterpiece!
   24 November 2018 | by paulclaassen – See all my reviews

   I love Wes Anderson's films and I love animation films. 'Isle of Dogs'
   was absolutely incredible! It is a demented, unsympathetic and uniquely
   different film that is completely and utterly stunning! The stop-motion
   animation is great. The script and dialogue is very good, and you gotta
   love the (dog) characters!
   The film featured some moments that had me belly-laughing and moments
   that just melted my heart. It never became sentimental or overly
   comical. The comedic moments were seriously funny. Wes Anderson pays
   great attention to detail and he obviously had a clear vision of what
   he wanted to portray. We don't always understand what the Japanese are
   saying, as they are not accompanied by subtitles, but that never
   mattered and - in fact - made it even more interesting, funny and
   unique.
   'Isle of Dogs' will go down as one of my all-time favorite movies.

Storyline

   Six close friends meet each week for a game night involving board
   games, charades and pop culture trivia quizzes. Being the most
   competitive of the bunch, Max and his wife Annie, who seem to be a
   perfect match in every way, usually win every time. However, their
   marriage is on rocky ground as Annie fears that Max doesn't want to
   have children. When Max's shady brother Brooks reappears after a long
   mysterious absence and suggests that they have their next gathering at
   his place, no one expects that their weekly game night is about to go
   to the next level as Brooks organizes a full blown murder mystery party
   complete with actors as criminals and cops for them. However, when
   Brooks is violently kidnapped in front of everyone, it turns out that
   the game is all too real. Now, Max, Annie, their womanizing dimwitted
   friend Ryan, his domineering Irish date Sarah, and their childhood
   friends Michelle and her husband Kevin, who's obsessed with finding out
   with which mysterious celebrity ...

   Very enjoyable comedy romp
   21 February 2018 | by deonast – See all my reviews

   This was a very enjoyable comedy. Plenty of jokes hit their mark and
   the audience loved it from the laughter I heard in the session. To be
   upfront I some advanced session tickets from the Australian
   distributor, won in a competition. So we all saw it for free, but if I
   wanted to see a good comedy this one is worth paying to watch.
   The humour is good, nothing too highbrow but you won't find any crass
   humour here, just good fun throughout the film.
   The film does have its silly moments and the twists towards the end
   stretch believability, but you don't really care as you don't watch
   this film to critique, but just to enjoy the ride for a few hours. The
   characters are not deep, but you quickly grow to like them all or feel
   sorry for them as the film flows on.
   Enjoyable, good clean fun with the odd bit of blood, that is even used
   to humourous effect.
