The new civics course in US schools: How to spot fake news

   WILLIAMSVILLE, N.Y. (AP) &#8212; Teachers from elementary school
   through college are telling students how to distinguish between factual
   and fictional news &#8212; and why they should care that there’s a
   difference.

   As Facebook works with The Associated Press, FactCheck.org and other
   organizations to curb the spread of fake and misleading news on its
   influential network, teachers say classroom instruction can play a role
   in deflating the kind of ”Pope endorses Trump ” headlines that muddied
   the waters during the 2016 presidential campaign.

   “I think only education can solve this problem,” said Pat Winters
   Lauro, a professor at New Jersey’s Kean University who began teaching a
   course on news literacy this semester.

   Like others, Lauro has found discussions of fake news can lead to
   politically sensitive territory. Some critics believe fake stories
   targeting Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton helped Donald
   Trump overcome a deficit in public opinion polls, and President Trump
   himself has attached the label to various media outlets and unfavorable
   reports and polls in the first weeks of his presidency.

   “It hasn’t been a difficult topic to teach in terms of material because
   there’s so much going on out there,” Lauro said, “but it’s difficult in
   terms of politics because we have such a divided country and the
   students are divided, too, on their beliefs. I’m afraid sometimes that
   they think I’m being political when really I’m just talking about
   journalistic standards for facts and verification, and they look at it
   like ‘Oh, you’re anti-this or -that.’”

   Judging what to trust was easier when the sources were clearer &#8212;
   magazines, newspapers or something else, said Kean senior Mike Roche,
   who is taking Lauro’s class. Now “it all comes through the same medium
   of your cellphone or your computer, so it’s very easy to blur the lines
   and not have a clear distinction of what’s real and what’s fake,” he
   said.

   A California lawmaker last month introduced a bill to require the state
   to add lessons on how to distinguish between real and fake news to the
   grade 7-12 curriculum.

   High school government and politics teacher Lesley Battaglia added fake
   news to the usual election-season lessons on primaries and presidential
   debates, discussing credible sites and sources and running stories
   through fact-checking sites like Snopes. There were also lessons about
   anonymous sources and satire. (They got a kick out of China’s
   dissemination of a 2012 satirical story from The Onion naming Kim Jong
   Un as the sexiest man alive.)

   “I’m making you guys do the hard stuff that not everybody always does.
   They see it in a tweet and that’s enough for them,” Battaglia told her
   students at Williamsville South High School in suburban Buffalo.

   “It’s kind of crazy,” 17-year-old student Hannah Mercer said, “to think
   about how much it’s affecting people and swaying their opinions.”

   Stony Brook University’s Center for News Literacy pioneered the idea of
   educating future news consumers, and not just journalists, a decade ago
   with the rise of online news. About four in 10 Americans often get news
   online, a 2016 Pew Research Center report found. Stony Brook last month
   partnered with the University of Hong Kong to launch a free online
   course.

   “To me, it’s the new civics course,” said Tom Boll, after wrapping up
   his own course on real and fake news at the Newhouse School at Syracuse
   University. With everyone now able to post and share, gone are the days
   of the network news and newspaper editors serving as the primary
   gatekeepers of information, Boll, an adjunct professor, said.

   “The gates are wide open,” he said, “and it’s up to us to figure out
   what to believe.”

   That’s not easy, said Raleigh, North Carolina-area teacher Bill
   Ferriter, who encourages students to first use common sense to question
   whether a story could be true, to look at web addresses and authors for
   hints, and to be skeptical of articles that seem aimed at riling them
   up.

   He pointed to an authentic-looking site reporting that President Barack
   Obama signed an order in December banning the Pledge of Allegiance in
   schools. A ”.co” at the end of an impostor news site web address should
   have been a red flag, he said.

   “The biggest challenge that I have whenever I try to teach kids about
   questionable content on the web,” said Ferriter, who teaches sixth
   grade, “is convincing them that there is such a thing as questionable
   content on the web.”

   Some of Battaglia’s students fear fake news will chip away at the trust
   of even credible news sources and give public figures license to
   dismiss as fake news anything unfavorable.

   “When people start to distrust all news sources is when people in power
   are just allowed to do whatever they want, said Katie Peter, “and
   that’s very scary.”

Memo: Trump prodded Ukraine leader to investigate Bidens

   WASHINGTON (AP) — More than once, President Donald Trump brought up how
   much the U.S. has done for Ukraine.

   Time and again, he asked Ukraine’s president for help.

   There was no explicit quid pro quo in Trump’s half-hour phone call with
   Volodymyr Zelenskiy last July. But it wouldn’t have been a stretch to
   make a connection between Trump’s pleas for help and his mentions of
   U.S. assistance.

   “We do a lot for Ukraine,” Trump said at one point.

   “Do us a favor,” he asked at another.

   The White House released a rough transcript of the two leaders’ phone
   call Wednesday, and it showed that Trump repeatedly prodded Zelenskiy
   to work with the U.S. attorney general and lawyer Rudy Giuliani to
   investigate Democratic political rival Joe Biden.

   Trump raised allegations, without citing any evidence, that the former
   vice president sought to interfere with a Ukrainian prosecutor in
   regard to son Hunter.

   “Whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great,” Trump
   told Zelenskiy, asking for help in investigating Biden. He referred to
   Giuliani, his personal attorney and trusted adviser, as a “highly
   respected man” and said, “I will ask him to call you along with the
   attorney general.”

   After saying Giuliani and Barr would be in touch, Trump referenced
   Ukraine’s economy, saying: “Your economy is going to get better and
   better I predict. You have a lot of assets. It’s a great country.”

   Zelenskiy had earlier brought up his desire to purchase more Javelin
   anti-tank missiles from the U.S.

   The July 25 conversation between the two leaders is part of a
   whistleblower’s complaint that is central to the formal impeachment
   inquiry launched Tuesday by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

   The White House account reveals that Trump was willing to engage a
   foreign leader to dig up dirt on a political foe and that he went so
   far as to volunteer his attorney general to help.

   Days before the call, Trump froze nearly $400 million in aid to
   Ukraine. It was not clear from the summary whether Zelenskiy was aware
   of that, and the White House did not respond to requests to clarify.
   The president has insisted he did nothing wrong and has denied that any
   request for help was tied to the aid freeze.

   During a meeting with Trump Wednesday on the sidelines of the U.N.
   General Assembly, Zelenskiy said he felt no pressure to act on his call
   with Trump.

   “Nobody pushed me,” he said.

   It’s illegal under federal law to seek foreign government assistance
   for U.S. elections.

   The release of the rough transcript sets the framework of the political
   debate to come. Trump, at the U.N. on Wednesday, dismissed it and said
   as he often does that’s he’s the victim of “the single greatest witch
   hunt in American history.” Democrats say it lays the groundwork for the
   congressional impeachment inquiry.

   Trump aides believed that his oblique, message-by-suggestion style of
   speaking would not lend itself to the discovery of a “smoking gun” in
   Wednesday’s summary. His previous messages to his staff were at the
   center of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into
   obstruction of justice in the Trump-Russia case.

   Trump’s “favor” for Zelenskiy was seeking his help looking into a
   cybersecurity firm that investigated the 2016 hack of the Democratic
   National Committee and determined it was carried out by Russia. Trump
   has falsely suggested Crowdstrike was owned by a Ukrainian.

   Then Trump moved to “the other thing” — raising the subject of one of
   his leading Democratic rivals and a Ukrainian prosecutor: “There’s a
   lot of talk about Biden’s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a
   lot of people want to find out about that.”

   In the conversation, Trump doesn’t distinguish between the roles of
   Giuliani, his personal attorney and political ally, and Barr, who as
   the nation’s top law enforcement officer is meant to be above the
   political fray. Barr has been a staunch defender of Trump, most notably
   during the Mueller investigation.

   It’s not the first time Trump has sought foreign assistance to
   undermine a political rival. He publicly asked Russia to find missing
   Hillary Clinton emails in 2016, but this is his first documented time
   doing so while president with the weight of the U.S. government at his
   disposal.

   The White House did not say whether there are any records of Giuliani’s
   communications with Zelenskiy, nor did it address whether the
   president’s personal attorney learned anything from them. The White
   House has also not commented on whether Trump discussed Biden on an
   April 21 call with the Ukrainian leader or with any other foreign
   power.

   The president took the call from the White House residence, while
   officials in the Situation Room listened in and worked to keep a record
   of the conversation, as is standard practice. They used voice
   recognition software, but the call was not recorded. Trump ordered the
   document declassified Tuesday.

   The release came against the backdrop of the president presiding over a
   meeting of world leaders at the United Nations, a remarkable split
   screen even for the turbulence of the Trump era.

   The inspector general for the intelligence community wrote to the
   acting Director of National Intelligence in August that he believed the
   conversation between Trump and Ukraine’s leader could have been a
   federal campaign finance violation because the president could have
   been soliciting a campaign contribution from a foreign government, a
   Justice Department official said.

   The whistleblower — a member of the intelligence community — said in
   their complaint that they had heard the information from “White House
   officials,” but did not have firsthand knowledge of the call, the
   Justice Department official said.

   Prosecutors from the department reviewed a transcript of the call and
   determined the president did not violate campaign finance law. The
   determination was made based on the elements of the allegation, and
   there was no consideration of the department’s policy that a sitting
   president cannot be indicted, the official said.

   The official spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss
   internal investigative deliberations.

   Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said the attorney general
   was first notified of Trump’s conversation with the Ukrainian president
   “several weeks after the call took place,” when the department received
   the referral about potential criminal conduct.

   “The president has not spoken with the attorney general about having
   Ukraine investigate anything relating to former Vice President Biden or
   his son. The president has not asked the attorney general to contact
   Ukraine -- on this or any other matter,” the spokeswoman said.

   Trump has sought to implicate Biden and his son in the kind of
   corruption that has long plagued Ukraine. Hunter Biden served on the
   board of a Ukrainian gas company at the same time his father was
   leading the Obama administration’s diplomatic dealings with Kyiv.
   Though the timing raised concerns among anti-corruption advocates,
   there has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either the former vice
   president or his son.

   Lawmakers, who have been demanding details of the whistleblower’s
   complaint, were to gain access to the document in a classified setting
   late Wednesday ahead of the testimony of acting director of national
   intelligence Joseph Maguire Thursday.

   The complaint has set off a stunning turn of American political events,
   leading Pelosi to yield to mounting pressure from fellow Democrats on
   the impeachment inquiry.

   Trump, who thrives on combat, has all but dared Democrats to take this
   step, confident that the specter of impeachment led by the opposition
   party will bolster rather than diminish his political support.

Washington plunges into Trump impeachment investigation

   WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump pressed the leader of Ukraine
   to “look into” Joe Biden, Trump’s potential 2020 reelection rival, as
   well as the president’s lingering grievances from the 2016 election,
   according to a rough transcript of a summer phone call that is now at
   the center of Democrats’ impeachment probe.

   Trump repeatedly prodded Volodymyr Zelenskiy, new president of the East
   European nation, to work with U.S. Attorney General William Barr and
   Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s personal lawyer. At one point in the July
   conversation, Trump said, “I would like for you to do us a favor.”

   The president’s request for such help from a foreign leader set the
   parameters for the major U.S. debate to come — just the fourth
   impeachment investigation of an American president in the nation’s
   history. The initial response highlighted the deep divide between the
   two parties: Democrats said the call amounted to a “shakedown” of a
   foreign leader, while Trump - backed by the vast majority of
   Republicans - dismissed it as a “nothing call.”

   The call is one part of a whistleblower complaint about the president’s
   activities that have roiled Washington and led Democrats to move ahead
   with an impeachment inquiry of the Republican president on the cusp of
   the 2020 campaign.

   After being stymied by the administration, members of the House and
   Senate intelligence committees took their first look at the complaint
   late Wednesday. Republicans kept largely quiet, but several Democrats,
   including Intelligence committee chairman Adam Schiff, called the
   classified account “disturbing.”

   Some from both parties want it to be made public. Congress is also
   seeking an in-person interview with the whistleblower, who remains
   anonymous.

   Trump spent Wednesday meeting with world leaders at the United Nations,
   a remarkable TV split screen even for the turbulence of the Trump era.
   Included on his schedule: a meeting with Zelenskiy.

   In a light-hearted appearance before reporters, Zelenskiy said he
   didn’t want to get involved in American elections, but added, “Nobody
   pushed me.” Trump chimed in, “In other words, no pressure.”

   The next steps in the impeachment inquiry were quickly developing a day
   after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi launched the probe. A rush of
   lawmakers, notably moderate Democrats from districts where Trump
   remains popular, set aside political concerns and urged action.

   One option Pelosi is considering, pressed by some lawmakers, is to
   focus the impeachment inquiry specifically on the Ukraine issues rather
   than the many others Congress has already been investigating.

   “For me, that’s what’s important,” said Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich.,
   among the new lawmakers in Congress with national security backgrounds.
   She said it’s “just an egregious idea that the president of the United
   States can contact a foreign leader and influence him for dirt on a
   political opponent. ... That can’t be normalized.”

   Pelosi announced the impeachment probe Tuesday after months of personal
   resistance to a process she has warned would be divisive for the
   country and risky for her party. But after viewing the transcript on
   Wednesday, Pelosi declared: “Congress must act.”

   Trump, who thrives on combat, has all but dared Democrats to move
   toward impeachment, confident that the specter of an investigation led
   by the opposition party will bolster rather than diminish his political
   support.

   “It’s a joke. Impeachment, for that?” Trump said during a news
   conference in New York. He revived the same language he has used for
   months to deride the now-finished special counsel investigation into
   election interference, declaring impeachment “a hoax” and the “single
   greatest witch hunt in American history.”

   Republicans largely stood by the president and dismissed the notion
   that the rough transcript revealed any wrongdoing by Trump.

   “I think it was a perfectly appropriate phone call, it was a
   congratulatory phone call,” said Rep. Liz Cheney, the No. 3 House
   Republican. “The Democrats continually make these huge claims and
   allegations about President Trump, and then you find out there’s no
   there there.”

   The Trump administration also continued to raise questions about the
   whistleblower’s motives. According to a Justice Department official,
   the intelligence community’s inspector general said in letter to the
   acting director of national intelligence that the whistleblower could
   have “arguable political bias.”

   The memo released by the White House was not a verbatim transcript, but
   was instead based on the records of officials who listened to the call.
   The conversation took place on July 25, one day after special counsel
   Robert Mueller testified on Capitol Hill about his investigation into
   Russia’s 2016 election interference.

   In the 30-minute phone call with Zelenskiy, Trump encourages the
   Ukrainian leader to talk with Giuliani and Barr about Biden and his son
   Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. Immediately
   after saying they would be in touch, Trump references Ukraine’s
   economy, saying: “Your economy is going to get better and better I
   predict. You have a lot of assets. It’s a great country.”

   At another point in the conversation, Trump asked Zelenskiy for a
   favor: his help looking into a cybersecurity firm that investigated the
   2016 hack of the Democratic National Committee and determined it was
   carried out by Russia. Trump has falsely suggested Crowdstrike was
   owned by a Ukrainian.

   In the days before the call, Trump ordered advisers to freeze $400
   million in military aid for Ukraine — prompting speculation that he was
   holding out the money as leverage for information on the Bidens. Trump
   has denied that charge and the aid package does not come up in the
   conversation with Zelenskiy.

   Trump has sought to implicate Biden and his son in the kind of
   corruption that has long plagued Ukraine. Hunter Biden served on the
   gas company’s board at the same time his father was leading the Obama
   administration’s diplomatic dealings with Kyiv. Though the timing
   raised concerns among anti-corruption advocates, there has been no
   evidence of wrongdoing by either the former vice president or his son.

   Biden said it was “tragedy” that Trump was willing to “put personal
   politics above his sacred oath.” He singled out Trump’s attempts to
   pull Barr and the Justice Department into efforts to investigate Biden,
   calling it “a direct attack on the core independence of that
   department, an independence essential to the rule of law.”

   While the possibility of impeachment has hung over Trump for many
   months, the likelihood of a probe had faded after special counsel
   Robert Mueller’s Trump-Russia investigation ended without a clear
   directive for lawmakers.

   Since then, the House committees have revisited aspects of the Mueller
   probe while also launching new inquiries into Trump’s businesses and
   various administration scandals that all seemed likely to drag on for
   months.

   Details of Trump’s dealings with Ukraine prompted Democrats to quickly
   shift course. By the time Pelosi announced the probe, two-thirds of
   House Democrats had announced moving toward impeachment probes.

   The burden will probably now shift to Democrats to make the case to a
   scandal-weary public. In a highly polarized Congress, an impeachment
   inquiry could simply showcase how clearly two sides can disagree when
   shown the same evidence rather than approach consensus.

   LONDON (AP) — The Latest on Britain’s impending departure from the
   European Union (all times local):

   7:05 p.m.

   Britain’s main opposition leader has rejected Prime Minister Boris
   Johnson’s taunting demand for a no-confidence vote in the government,
   saying he won’t support a new election unless a no-deal Brexit is ruled
   out.

   Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn says Johnson should secure a delay to
   Britain’s EU exit — scheduled for Oct. 31 — and “then let’s have an
   election.”

   And he called for Johnson to resign over his illegal suspension of
   Parliament.

   He said Johnson “should have done the honorable thing and resigned”
   after the Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that the prime minister’s attempt
   to shut down Parliament for five weeks was unlawful. Johnson says he
   won’t quit.

   Johnson accuses his opponents of being scared of the verdict of the
   public for refusing to back an election.

   6:45 p.m.

   British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has dared opposition parties to
   try to topple his government with a no-confidence vote.

   In an extremely unusual move, Johnson said the government would welcome
   a no-confidence motion from any of the opposition parties. He said he
   would make time for such a vote on Thursday.

   If the government lost, a two-week period would be triggered in which
   Johnson or another lawmaker could try to form a new government and win
   a subsequent confidence vote.

   If that failed, there would be an election.

   Johnson wants to hold an election in hope of breaking the stalemate
   over Brexit that has left Britain’s departure, scheduled for Oct. 31,
   in limbo.

   Earlier this month lawmakers twice rejected a call for a snap poll.

   Opposition lawmakers say they won’t trigger an election until the risk
   of crashing out of the EU next month without a divorce deal has been
   eliminated.

   Johnson accuses his opponents of being scared of the public.

   3:50 p.m.

   The European Parliament’s top Brexit official says that the British
   government’s proposals on how to maintain an open border on the island
   of Ireland do not meet the conditions necessary to force a breakthrough
   in the stalled negotiations between the U.K. and the EU.

   Belgian MEP Guy Verhofstadt told an EU parliamentary committee that the
   alternatives offered were “not meeting” the benchmarks the EU has set
   out for an orderly British exit. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has
   insisted that the Irish border provision negotiated by his predecessor,
   Theresa May, is scrapped.

   He also said the EU would be willing to grant an extension to Britain’s
   Oct. 31 Brexit date if London provided enough arguments to merit such a
   move.

   12:50 p.m.

   British Attorney General Geoffrey Cox has accused Parliament of being a
   “disgrace” as lawmakers returned for the first day of work since a
   bombshell court decision deemed Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s
   suspension of Parliament illegal.

   Cox’s baritone voice boomed across the House of Commons on Wednesday as
   he defended the advice he gave to Johnson saying the suspension was
   legal. He accused lawmakers of being “too cowardly” to vote for a
   motion of no-confidence in the government, which would trigger an early
   election.

   Cox called it a “dead Parliament” that lacked the moral right “to sit
   on these green benches.”

   Cox added, “this Parliament should have the courage to face the
   electorate, but it won’t, because so many of them are really all about
   preventing us leaving the European Union. But the time is coming, the
   time is coming, Mr. Speaker, when even these turkeys won’t be able to
   prevent Christmas.”

   11:40 a.m.

   Lawmakers at the House of Commons in London have resumed work after the
   Supreme Court ruled that Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s suspension of
   Parliament was illegal.

   Parliament opened Wednesday morning, one day after the landmark ruling.
   The session was convened by House of Commons Speaker John Bercow, who
   had earlier called Johnson’s suspension a “constitutional outrage.”

   Johnson is expected to face renewed calls for his resignation from some
   legislators. He says he will not step down.

   Parliament is seeking to prevent Johnson from taking Britain out of the
   European Union on Oct. 31 if no divorce deal is reached. Johnson says
   Britain will leave on that day with or without a deal.

   ____

   10:30 a.m.

   British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has flown back early to London,
   cutting short his visit to New York and the U.N. General Assembly
   because a court ruling that overturned his suspension of Parliament.

   Lawmakers resumed work at the House of Commons on Wednesday following
   the bombshell Supreme Court ruling a day earlier that Johnson had acted
   illegally by suspending Parliament — in effect stymieing their efforts
   to consider laws surrounding Brexit.

   Johnson remains on a collision course with Parliament over his
   determination to extract Britain from the EU on Oct. 31, even if no
   divorce deal is reached. Parliament has passed a law requiring him to
   seek an extension if there is no deal, but Johnson says he won’t do
   that under any circumstances.

   Johnson will address Parliament on Wednesday afternoon but has begun to
   position himself as the champion of the people facing a recalcitrant
   establishment bent on frustrating the 2016 Brexit vote.

   10 a.m.

   British lawmakers are returning to the House of Commons following the
   bombshell Supreme Court ruling that Prime Minister Boris Johnson had
   acted illegally by suspending Parliament — in effect stymieing their
   efforts to consider laws surrounding Brexit.

   The historic move backed Parliament’s sovereignty and slapped down what
   justices viewed as an effort by Johnson that essentially squelched
   debate on the most divisive political issue the country has faced in
   years. The prime minister hurried back to London after cutting short a
   trip to the U.N. General Assembly amid demands for his resignation from
   furious opposition parties.

   In New York, Johnson brushed aside questions about whether he would
   resign, said he “strongly” disagreed with the court decision and
   suggested he might try to suspend Parliament for a second time. Cabinet
   minister Michael Gove says the government “respected” the court
   decision but refused to apologize for breaking the law.

‘We’re all in big trouble’: Climate panel sees a dire future

   NEW YORK (AP) — Earth is in more hot water than ever before, and so are
   we, an expert United Nations climate panel warned in a grim new report
   Wednesday.

   Sea levels are rising at an ever-faster rate as ice and snow shrink,
   and oceans are getting more acidic and losing oxygen, the
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said in a report issued as
   world leaders met at the United Nations.
   AP Series: What Can Be Saved

   It warned that if steps aren’t taken to reduce emissions and slow
   global warming, seas will rise 3 feet by the end of the century, with
   many fewer fish, less snow and ice, stronger and wetter hurricanes and
   other, nastier weather systems.

   “The oceans and the icy parts of the world are in big trouble, and that
   means we’re all in big trouble, too,” said one of the report’s lead
   authors, Michael Oppenheimer, professor of geosciences and
   international affairs at Princeton University. “The changes are
   accelerating.”

   The dire effects will be felt on both land and sea, harming people,
   plants, animals, food, societies, infrastructure and the global
   economy. In fact, the international team of scientists projected for
   the first time that some island nations will probably become
   uninhabitable.

   The oceans absorb more than 90% of the excess heat from carbon
   pollution in the air, as well as much of the carbon dioxide itself.
   Earth’s snow and ice, called the cryosphere, are also being eroded.

   “The world’s oceans and cryosphere have been taking the heat for
   climate change for decades. The consequences for nature and humanity
   are sweeping and severe,” said Ko Barrett, vice chair of the IPCC and a
   deputy assistant administrator for research at the U.S. National
   Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

   The report found:

   — Seas are now rising at one-seventh of an inch (3.66 millimeters) a
   year, which is 2.5 times faster than the rate from 1900 to 1990.

   — The world’s oceans have already lost 1% to 3% of the oxygen in their
   upper levels since 1970 and will lose more as warming continues.

   —From 2006 to 2015, the ice melting from Greenland, Antarctica and the
   world’s mountain glaciers has accelerated. They are now losing 720
   billion tons (653 billion metric tons) of ice a year.

   —Arctic June snow cover has shrunk more than half since 1967, down
   nearly 1 million square miles (2.5 million square kilometers).

   —Arctic sea ice in September, the annual low point, is down almost 13%
   per decade since 1979. This year’s low, reported Monday, tied for the
   second-lowest on record.

   —Marine animals are likely to decrease 15%, and catches by fisheries in
   general are expected to decline 21% to 24%, by the end of century
   because of climate change.

   “Climate change is already irreversible,” French climate scientist
   Valérie Masson-Delmotte, a report lead author, said at a news
   conference in Monaco, where the document was released. “Due to the heat
   uptake in the ocean, we can’t go back.”

   But many of the worst-case projections in the report can still be
   avoided, depending on how the world handles the emissions of
   heat-trapping gases, the report’s authors said.

   The IPCC increased its projected end-of-century sea level rise in the
   worst-case scenario by nearly 4 inches (10 centimeters) from its 2013
   projections because of the increased recent melting of ice sheets in
   Greenland and Antarctica.

   The new report projects that, under the business-as-usual scenario for
   carbon emissions, seas by the end of the century will rise between 2
   feet (61 centimeters) and 43 inches (110 centimeters), with a most
   likely rise of 33 inches (84 centimeters). This is slightly less than
   the traditional 1 meter (39 inches) that scientists often use.

   And sea level will rise two to three times as much over the centuries
   to come if warming continues, so the world is looking at a “future that
   certainly looks completely different than what we currently have,” said
   report co-author Hans-Otto Portner, a German climate scientist.

   The Nobel Prize-winning IPCC requires that its reports be unanimously
   approved. Because of that, its reports tend to show less sea level rise
   and smaller harm than other scientific studies, outside experts said.

   “Like many of the past reports, this one is conservative in the
   projections, especially in how much ice can be lost in Greenland and
   Antarctica,” said NASA oceanographer Josh Willis, who studies Greenland
   ice melt and wasn’t part of the report.

   Willis said people should be prepared for a rise in sea levels to be
   twice these IPCC projections.

   The world’s warm water coral reefs will go extinct in some places and
   be dramatically different in others, the report said.

   “We are already seeing the demise of the warm water coral reefs,”
   Portner said. “That is one of the strongest warning signals that we
   have available.”

   Outside scientists praised the work but were disturbed by it.

   “It is alarming to read such a thorough cataloging of all of the
   serious changes in the planet that we’re driving,” said Texas A&amp;M
   University climate scientist Andrew Dessler. “What’s particularly
   disturbing as a scientist is that virtually all of these changes were
   predicted years or decades ago.”

   The report’s authors emphasized that it doesn’t doom Earth to this
   gloomy future.

   “We indicate we have a choice. Whether we go into a grim future depends
   on the decisions that are being made,” Portner said.
