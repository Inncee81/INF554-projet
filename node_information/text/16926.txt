   "We looked at many themes, but it was Hestia Pro that we settled on. It
   had all the features and more than we needed. It's easy to work and
   modify and it plays well with WooCommerce too. We couldn't be happier
   with Hestia Pro theme giving our store that professional look with
   minimal expense in time, because really, our business is not building
   websites. Our business is creating tutorials."

ASK A QUESTION

Frequently Asked Questions

   (BUTTON) How does the website limit work?
   Once you choose a plan, you get access to a specific number of websites
   to activate the product. After the license is active you will start
   getting security updates. Yes, subdomains count as an active website
   (this includes WordPress multisite). You can use the product on any
   number of websites owned by you or not. Keep in mind that you will only
   receive updates, support, and new features just for the websites with
   an active license.
   (BUTTON) Do I start from scratch if I upgrade to PRO?
   No. When you upgrade to the premium version of a product you get all
   the PRO features and everything integrates seamlessly. The extra
   features will be added and your existing work will be there. If you're
   still worried, you can always back up your files.
   (BUTTON) How often do I have to pay, are there other costs?
   With the annual subscription, you will have to renew after the first
   year if you want to continue receiving security updates and support. If
   you choose so at the checkout, you will be automatically renewed each
   year. Lifetime is a one-time payment, and as long as the product is
   maintained, you will get support and security updates.
   (BUTTON) Can I still use the product if I don't renew?
   Your product will still operate even if you cancel the automated
   renewal subscription for the yearly plans, but you won’t get updates
   and support after the license expires.
   (BUTTON) Is there a difference between annual and lifetime?
   The short answer is no. No matter the payment option the plans include
   the same features. It just depends on your preferences and how long you
   plan to use the product.
   (BUTTON) Still have a question?
   If you have not found the answer to your question here, get in touch
   and we will be happy to help.

   modify and it plays well with WooCommerce too. We couldn't be happier
   with Hestia Pro theme giving our store that professional look with

ASK A QUESTION

Frequently Asked Questions

   (BUTTON) How does the website limit work?
   Once you choose a plan, you get access to a specific number of websites
   to activate the product. After the license is active you will start
   getting security updates. Yes, subdomains count as an active website
   (this includes WordPress multisite). You can use the product on any
   number of websites owned by you or not. Keep in mind that you will only
   receive updates, support, and new features just for the websites with
   an active license.
   (BUTTON) Do I start from scratch if I upgrade to PRO?
   No. When you upgrade to the premium version of a product you get all
   the PRO features and everything integrates seamlessly. The extra
   features will be added and your existing work will be there. If you're
   still worried, you can always back up your files.
   (BUTTON) How often do I have to pay, are there other costs?
   With the annual subscription, you will have to renew after the first
   year if you want to continue receiving security updates and support. If
   you choose so at the checkout, you will be automatically renewed each
   year. Lifetime is a one-time payment, and as long as the product is
   maintained, you will get support and security updates.
   (BUTTON) Can I still use the product if I don't renew?
   Your product will still operate even if you cancel the automated
   renewal subscription for the yearly plans, but you won’t get updates
   and support after the license expires.
   (BUTTON) Is there a difference between annual and lifetime?
   The short answer is no. No matter the payment option the plans include
   the same features. It just depends on your preferences and how long you
   plan to use the product.
   (BUTTON) Still have a question?
   If you have not found the answer to your question here, get in touch
   and we will be happy to help.

   "We looked at many themes, but it was Hestia Pro that we settled on. It
   had all the features and more than we needed. It's easy to work and
   modify and it plays well with WooCommerce too. We couldn't be happier
   with Hestia Pro theme giving our store that professional look with
   minimal expense in time, because really, our business is not building
   websites. Our business is creating tutorials."

ASK A QUESTION

Frequently Asked Questions

   (BUTTON) How does the website limit work?
   Once you choose a plan, you get access to a specific number of websites
   to activate the product. After the license is active you will start
   getting security updates. Yes, subdomains count as an active website
   (this includes WordPress multisite). You can use the product on any
   number of websites owned by you or not. Keep in mind that you will only
   receive updates, support, and new features just for the websites with
   an active license.
   (BUTTON) Do I start from scratch if I upgrade to PRO?
   No. When you upgrade to the premium version of a product you get all
   the PRO features and everything integrates seamlessly. The extra
   features will be added and your existing work will be there. If you're
   still worried, you can always back up your files.
   (BUTTON) How often do I have to pay, are there other costs?
   With the annual subscription, you will have to renew after the first
   year if you want to continue receiving security updates and support. If
   you choose so at the checkout, you will be automatically renewed each
   year. Lifetime is a one-time payment, and as long as the product is
   maintained, you will get support and security updates.
   (BUTTON) Can I still use the product if I don't renew?
   Your product will still operate even if you cancel the automated
   renewal subscription for the yearly plans, but you won’t get updates
   and support after the license expires.
   (BUTTON) Is there a difference between annual and lifetime?
   The short answer is no. No matter the payment option the plans include
   the same features. It just depends on your preferences and how long you
   plan to use the product.
   (BUTTON) Still have a question?
   If you have not found the answer to your question here, get in touch
   and we will be happy to help.

   "The theme has helped us build a functional, reliable and modern
   fitness business online. It was especially important to us that the
   design looks fresh - and our homepage is user-friendly. We are also
   really happy and pleased with the versatile and cool features. I'm
   really proud of our website, thank you ThemeIsle for making our visions

   "We looked at many themes, but it was Hestia Pro that we settled on. It
   had all the features and more than we needed. It's easy to work and
   modify and it plays well with WooCommerce too. We couldn't be happier
   with Hestia Pro theme giving our store that professional look with
   minimal expense in time, because really, our business is not building
   websites. Our business is creating tutorials."

ASK A QUESTION

Frequently Asked Questions

   (BUTTON) How does the website limit work?
   Once you choose a plan, you get access to a specific number of websites
   to activate the product. After the license is active you will start
   getting security updates. Yes, subdomains count as an active website
   (this includes WordPress multisite). You can use the product on any
   number of websites owned by you or not. Keep in mind that you will only
   receive updates, support, and new features just for the websites with
   an active license.
   (BUTTON) Do I start from scratch if I upgrade to PRO?
   No. When you upgrade to the premium version of a product you get all
   the PRO features and everything integrates seamlessly. The extra
   features will be added and your existing work will be there. If you're
   still worried, you can always back up your files.
   (BUTTON) How often do I have to pay, are there other costs?
   With the annual subscription, you will have to renew after the first
   year if you want to continue receiving security updates and support. If
   you choose so at the checkout, you will be automatically renewed each
   year. Lifetime is a one-time payment, and as long as the product is
   maintained, you will get support and security updates.
   (BUTTON) Can I still use the product if I don't renew?
   Your product will still operate even if you cancel the automated
   renewal subscription for the yearly plans, but you won’t get updates
   and support after the license expires.
   (BUTTON) Is there a difference between annual and lifetime?
   The short answer is no. No matter the payment option the plans include
   the same features. It just depends on your preferences and how long you
   plan to use the product.
   (BUTTON) Still have a question?
   If you have not found the answer to your question here, get in touch
   and we will be happy to help.
