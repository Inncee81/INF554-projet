F1

Subsonic continuous pressurized wind tunnel, variable pressure from 1 to 3,85
bars, Mach number: from 0,05 to 0,36

A large, high Reynolds number, low speed wind tunnel with high productivity.

   F1 wind tunnel overview















   Wind tunnel designed for high productivity and test confidentiality.

   Rectangular test section:
     * length: 11 m
     * width: 4.5 m
     * height: 3.5 m

   The test section is movable and can be fitted with any of the pallets
   forming the test section floor.

   Stagnation pressure is approximately equal to the local atmospheric
   pressure, i.e. about 0.9 bar.

   Stagnation temperature stands between 258 and 333 K according to Mach
   number and atmospheric temperature.
