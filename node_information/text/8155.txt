Plant-Based Food Options Are Sprouting Growth for Retailers

   CPG, FMCG & Retail | 06-13-2018

   From a consumption perspective, many would argue that there’s never
   been a better time to be a shopper. That’s because there’s something
   for everyone and every taste. And when it comes to nutrition, 37% of
   Americans say they’re following a specific diet this year, which is up
   from 35% last year and 29% in 2016. And with consumers narrowing their
   foci, brands and retailers need to stay tuned in—or risk missing out.

   Amid the various nutrition programs on the market today, plant-based
   diets are gaining particular prominence. Notably, a Nielsen Homescan
   survey last year found that 39% of Americans are actively trying to eat
   more plant-based foods. To meet their goals, however, many shoppers
   aren’t looking to traditional plant-based staples like tofu, brown rice
   and granola. In fact, sales of traditional plant-based options were
   down 1.3% in the year ended April 7, 2018.

   That’s not to say that growth in plant options is absent, however.
   Within the plant-based food space, innovation is booming, and an array
   of plant-based alternatives are posting significant sales growth.

   In looking across the U.S., 6% of Americans say they follow a strictly
   vegetarian lifestyle, while 3% follow a strictly vegan lifestyle.
   Regardless of motivations, the number of consumers adopting vegetarian
   or vegan lifestyles is increasing, predominantly among young and
   diverse consumer groups. In looking across demographic groups, ethnic
   and young consumers express higher intentions to eat more plant-based
   foods:
     * African Americans are 48% more likely than the average U.S.
       consumer to incorporate plant-based foods.
     * Asian Americans are 47% more likely than the average U.S. consumer
       to incorporate plant-based foods.
     * Hispanic consumers are 46% more likely than the average U.S.
       consumer to incorporate plant-based foods.
     * Caucasian Millennials are 47% more likely than the average U.S.
       consumer to incorporate plant-based foods.

   From a total store perspective, plant-based food options are no small
   potatoes. As of 2017, 19.5% of food and beverage dollars came from
   products that met a plant-based diet. And as a result of consumer
   interest, vegan (which excludes produce) and produce sales growth is
   outpacing total food and beverage sales.

   In addition, vegan and produce options increased their dollar share by
   nearly 2% between 2014 and 2017.

   Vegetarian and vegan offerings aren’t limited to solid foods, however,
   as most of us are well aware of the rise in dairy alternatives,
   particularly milk substitutes. And from a consumption perspective,
   Americans are going nuts for almond milk, which has posted a three-year
   combined annual growth rate of 8.2%.

   Whether it be due to health, ethics or sustainability, the proportion
   of U.S. consumers that adhere to a vegetarian or vegan diet is growing.
   And that presents notable opportunity for brands and retailers looking
   for ways to capitalize on specific needs and desires among consumers
   opting for plant-based food and beverage options, particularly in cases
   where no or few options currently exist.
