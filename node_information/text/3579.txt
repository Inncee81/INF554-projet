Cloudflare Privacy Policy

   Cloudflare is updating its Privacy Policy effective October 31, 2019.
   You can view the updated Privacy Policy here.

   Effective March 14, 2019

   We have updated our October 25, 2018 privacy policy to list our German
   entity as our legal representative entity in the EU and to add the
   contact information for our new office in Sydney, Australia.
     __________________________________________________________________

   This Cloudflare Privacy Policy (“Policy”) outlines the information that
   Cloudflare, Inc. (“Cloudflare”, “we”, “us” or “our”) gathers, how we
   use that information, and the options you have to access, correct, or
   delete such information.
     __________________________________________________________________

CLOUDFLARE’S PROMISE

   Our mission to help build a better Internet is rooted in the importance
   we place on establishing trust with our Customers, Website Visitors,
   and the Internet community globally. To earn and maintain that trust,
   we commit to communicating transparently, providing security, and
   protecting the privacy of data on our systems.

   We keep your personal information personal and private. We will not
   sell, rent, share, or otherwise disclose your personal information to
   anyone except as necessary to provide our services or as otherwise
   described in this Policy without first providing you with notice and
   the opportunity to consent.
    1. POLICY APPLICATION.
       This Policy applies to Cloudflare’s collection, use, and disclosure
       of the information of the following categories of individuals:
          + Attendees: Individuals who provide their information to
            Cloudflare or Cloudflare representatives when they attend or
            register to attend Cloudflare-sponsored events or other events
            at which Cloudflare participates.
          + Website Visitors: Individuals who visit our Websites and who
            may opt to provide an email address to receive communications
            from Cloudflare. For the purposes of this Policy, “Websites”
            shall refer collectively to www.cloudflare.com as well as any
            other websites Cloudflare owns and that link to this Policy.
            For clarity, “Websites” does not include any sites owned or
            operated by our Customers, including where we serve as
            Registrar.
          + Customers: Those who register on their own or on behalf of an
            entity or organization to use any of the Cloudflare Services
            (as defined below), including administrators on a Customer
            account. For the purposes of this Policy, “Services” shall
            refer to all network service solutions marketed for
            subscription at www.cloudflare.com, including when Services
            are sold by an authorized partner or reseller.
          + Resolver Users: Individuals who use Cloudflare’s Recursive
            Domain Name System (“DNS”) Resolver services, such as the
            1.1.1.1 Resolver. Learn more about 1.1.1.1.
          + End Users: Individuals who visit our Customers’ websites and
            whose information we process in order to provide the Services
            to our Customers pursuant to our agreements with them.
       This Policy does not apply to our Customers’ websites, which may
       have their own terms and privacy policies. Our Customers are solely
       responsible for establishing policies for and ensuring compliance
       with all applicable laws and regulations, including those relating
       to the collection of personal information in connection with the
       use of our Services by End Users with whom our Customers interact.
       Cloudflare’s Websites and Services are not intended for, nor
       designed to attract, individuals under the age of eighteen.
       Cloudflare does not knowingly collect personally identifiable
       information from any person under the age of eighteen.
    2. INFORMATION WE COLLECT.
       Attendees:
          + We may ask for and collect personal information such as your
            name, address, phone number and email address when you
            register for or attend a sponsored event or other events at
            which Cloudflare (and/or its representatives) participates.
       Website Visitors:
          + Name, email address, and other contact information. We ask for
            and—at your option—collect personal information from you when
            you submit web forms on our Websites, including opportunities
            to sign up for and agree to receive email communications from
            us. We also may ask you to submit such personal information if
            you choose to use interactive features of the Websites,
            including participation in surveys, contests, promotions,
            sweepstakes, requesting customer support, or otherwise
            communicating with us. We will send such communications in
            accordance with applicable law.
          + Log Files. Just as when you visit and interact with most
            websites and services delivered via the Internet, when you
            visit our Websites, including the Cloudflare Community Forum,
            we gather certain information and store it in log files. This
            information may include but is not limited to Internet
            Protocol (IP) addresses, system configuration information,
            URLs of referring pages, and locale and language preferences.
          + Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies. We may use cookies
            and other information gathering technologies for a variety of
            purposes, such as providing us with information about how you
            interact with our Websites and assisting us in our marketing
            efforts. You can control how websites use cookies by
            configuring your browser's privacy settings (please refer to
            your browser's help function to learn more about cookie
            controls). Note that if you disable cookies entirely,
            Cloudflare’s Websites may not function properly. We may also
            use cookies and similar technologies to provide you
            advertising on third-party sites based upon your browsing
            activities and interests. If you wish not to have this
            information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based
            ads, you may opt-out by clicking here (or if located in the
            European Union, click here). For more information about the
            cookies Cloudflare uses, please see our Cookie Policy.
          + Interactive Areas. The Websites may offer publicly accessible
            blogs, community forums, comments sections, discussion forums,
            or other interactive features (“Interactive Areas”). If you
            choose to participate in any of these Interactive Areas,
            please be aware that any information that you post in an
            Interactive Area might be read, collected, and used by others
            who access it. If you wish to remove your personal information
            from any of our Interactive Areas, please see the section
            below entitled, Your Data Rights.
       Customers:
          + Customer Account Information. When you register for a
            Cloudflare account, we collect your email address. We will
            also ask you to enter your website domain in order to
            participate in the Services. We refer to this information as
            “Customer Account Information” for the purposes of this
            Policy. Customer Account Information is required to identify
            you as a Customer and permit you to access your account(s). By
            voluntarily providing us with such Customer Account
            Information, you represent that you are the owner of such
            personal data or otherwise have the requisite consent to
            provide it to us.
          + Payment Information. You are not required to enter your credit
            card information unless and until you decide to continue with
            a paid subscription to our Services. When you sign up for one
            of our paid Services, you must provide billing information.
            The information you will need to submit depends on which
            billing method you choose. For example, if you pay with a
            credit card, we will collect your card information and billing
            address, although we do not store full credit card numbers or
            personal account numbers.
       Resolver Users:
          + We will collect limited DNS query data that is sent to the
            resolvers. This data does not contain user IP addresses or any
            other personally identifiable information, and the bulk of the
            data is only stored for 24 hours. You can learn more about our
            1.1.1.1 commitment to privacy here and here.
       End Users:
          + Cloudflare provides web optimization and security services
            that our Customers use to improve and protect their websites,
            including a reverse proxy, pass-through security service, and
            a content distribution network. Because Cloudflare is a
            reverse proxy, our IP addresses may appear in WHOIS and DNS
            records for websites using our Services. We are a conduit for
            information controlled by others. It is our Customers and
            their users who are responsible for the content transmitted
            across our network (e.g., images, written content, graphics,
            etc.).
          + We collect End Users’ information when they use our Customers’
            websites, web applications, and APIs. This information may
            include but is not limited to IP addresses, system
            configuration information, and other information about traffic
            to and from Customers’ websites (collectively, “Log Data”). We
            collect and use Log Data to operate, maintain, and improve our
            Services in performance of our obligations under our Customer
            agreements. For example, Log Data can help us to detect new
            threats, identify malicious third parties, and provide more
            robust security protection for our Customers.
       Legal Basis for Processing (EEA only):
       If you are an individual from the European Economic Area (EEA),
       please note that our legal basis for collecting and using your
       personal information will depend on the personal information
       collected and the specific context in which we collect it. We
       normally will collect personal information from you only where: (a)
       we have your consent to do so, (b) where we need your personal
       information to perform a contract with you (e.g. to deliver the
       Cloudflare Services you have requested), or (c) where the
       processing is in our legitimate interests. Please note that in most
       cases, if you do not provide the requested information, Cloudflare
       will not be able to provide the requested service to you.
       In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect
       personal information from you, or may otherwise need the personal
       information to protect your vital interests or those of another
       person.
       Where we rely on your consent to process your personal data, you
       have the right to withdraw or decline consent at any time. Where we
       rely on our legitimate interests to process your personal data, you
       have the right to object.
       If you have any questions about or need further information
       concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your
       personal information, please contact us at
       privacyquestions@cloudflare.com.
    3. HOW WE USE INFORMATION WE COLLECT.
       Cloudflare only processes personal information in a way that is
       compatible with and relevant for the purpose for which it was
       collected or authorized. As a general matter, for all categories of
       data we collect except Resolver User data, we may use the
       information we collect (including personal information, to the
       extent applicable) to:
          + provide, operate, maintain, improve, and promote the Website
            and Services;
          + enable you to access and use the Website and Services;
          + process and complete transactions, and send you related
            information, including purchase confirmations and invoices;
          + send transactional messages, including responses to your
            comments, questions, and requests; provide customer service
            and support; and send you technical notices, updates, security
            alerts, and support and administrative messages;
          + send commercial communications, in accordance with your
            communication preferences, such as providing you with
            information about products and services, features, surveys,
            newsletters, offers, promotions, contests, and events about us
            and our partners; and send other news or information about us
            and our partners. See Section 8 below for information on
            managing your communication preferences.
          + process and deliver contest or sweepstakes entries and
            rewards;
          + monitor and analyze trends, usage, and activities in
            connection with the Websites and Services and for marketing or
            advertising purposes;
          + comply with legal obligations as well as to investigate and
            prevent fraudulent transactions, unauthorized access to the
            Services, and other illegal activities;
          + personalize the Websites and Services, including by providing
            features or content that match your interests and preferences;
            and
          + process for other purposes for which we obtain your consent.
       Resolver Users. We use information we collect from Resolver Users
       to operate and improve the Cloudflare Resolver, such as to assist
       us in our debugging efforts if an issue arises. We will not combine
       the information collected from DNS queries with any other
       Cloudflare or third party data in any way that can be used to
       identify individual end users. Learn more.
       Information from Third Party Services. We may combine information
       we collect as described above with personal information we obtain
       from third parties. For example, we may combine information entered
       on a Cloudflare sales submission form with information we receive
       from a third-party sales intelligence platform vendor to enhance
       our ability to market our Services to Customers or potential
       Customers.
    4. INFORMATION SHARING.
       We work with other companies who help us run our business (“Service
       Providers”). These companies provide services to help us deliver
       customer support, process credit card payments, manage and contact
       our existing Customers as well as sales leads, provide marketing
       support, and otherwise operate and improve our Services. These
       Service Providers may only process personal information pursuant to
       our instructions and in compliance both with this Privacy Policy
       and other applicable confidentiality and security measures and
       regulations, including our obligations under the EU-US and Swiss-US
       Privacy Shield frameworks described in Section 6, below.
       Specifically, we do not permit our Service Providers to use any
       personal information we share with them for their own marketing
       purposes or for any other purpose than in connection with the
       services they provide to us.
       In addition to sharing with Service Providers as described above,
       we may also share your information with others in the following
       circumstances:
          + Within the Cloudflare Group (defined for the purposes of this
            Policy as Cloudflare Inc. (United States), Cloudflare Ltd.
            (England), and Cloudflare, Pte. Ltd. (Singapore));
          + With our resellers and other sales partners who may help us
            distribute the Services to Customers;
          + With an app developer when you install an app from our App
            Marketplace;
          + In the event of a merger, sale, change in control, or
            reorganization of all or part of our business;
          + When we are required to disclose personal information to
            respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to
            establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal
            claims. (Learn more about how we handle law enforcement
            requests here);
          + Where we have a good-faith belief sharing is necessary to
            investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal
            activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential
            threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of
            our Service Agreement, or as otherwise required to comply with
            our legal obligations; or
          + as you may otherwise consent from time to time.
       Learn more about information sharing specific to the 1.1.1.1
       Resolver.
       We do not sell, rent, or share personal information with third
       parties for their direct marketing purposes, including as defined
       under California Civil Code Sec. 1798.83.
    5. DATA AGGREGATION.
       Cloudflare may aggregate data we acquire about our Customers and
       their End Users, including the Log Data described above. For
       example, we may assemble data to determine how Web crawlers index
       the Internet and whether they are engaged in malicious activity or
       to compile web traffic reports and statistics. Non-personally
       identifiable, aggregated data may be shared with third parties.
    6. INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION TRANSFERS.
       Cloudflare is a U.S.-based, global company. We primarily store your
       information in the United States and the European Economic Area
       (the “EEA”). To facilitate our global operations, we may transfer
       and access such information from around the world, including from
       other countries in which the Cloudflare Group has operations for
       the purposes described in this Policy.
       Whenever Cloudflare shares personal information originating in the
       EEA or Switzerland with a Cloudflare entity outside the EEA or
       Switzerland, it will do so on the basis of the EU standard
       contractual clauses or the Privacy Shield Frameworks detailed in
       this section.
       If you are accessing or using our Websites or Services or otherwise
       providing information to us, you are agreeing to the transfer of
       your personal information to the United States and other
       jurisdictions in which we operate.
       Cloudflare is certified under both the EU-U.S. and the Swiss-U.S.
       Privacy Shield Frameworks as set forth by the U.S. Department of
       Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal
       information transferred from the EEA and Switzerland to the United
       States, respectively. If there is any conflict between the terms in
       this Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield
       Principles shall govern. For more information on the EU-U.S.
       Privacy Shield or Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield, please visit the U.S.
       Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield website at:
       https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome.
    7. DATA SUBJECT RIGHTS.
       Attendees, Website Visitors, and Customers: You have the right to
       access, correct, update, export, or delete your personal
       information. You may email us at SAR@cloudflare.com with any such
       subject access requests (“SAR”), and we will respond within thirty
       (30) days. Customers also can access, correct, export, or update
       their Account Information by editing their profile or organization
       record at cloudflare.com.
       Resolver Users: We do not retain any personally identifiable
       information about Resolver Users that would be subject to the data
       subject rights described above.
       End Users: Cloudflare has no direct relationship with End Users.
       Even where “Cloudflare” may be indicated as the authoritative name
       server for a domain, unless Cloudflare is the owner of that domain,
       we have no control over a domain’s content. Accordingly, we rely
       upon our Customers to comply with the underlying legal requirements
       for subject access requests. If an End User requests that we
       access, correct, update, or delete their information, or no longer
       wishes to be contacted by one of our Customers that use our
       Services, we will direct that End User to contact the Customer
       website(s) with which they interacted directly. Our Customers are
       solely responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable laws
       and regulations with respect to their website users.
       For any SAR, we will need to verify a requestor is inquiring about
       their own information before we can assist. Where a SAR may
       implicate the personal data of another individual, we must balance
       the request against the risk of violating another person’s privacy
       rights. We will comply with SARs to the extent required by
       applicable law or the US-Swiss or US-EU Privacy Shield. In the EU,
       you also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory
       authority.
    8. COMMUNICATION PREFERENCES.
       You may manage your receipt of commercial communications by
       clicking on the “unsubscribe” link located on the bottom of such
       emails, through your account settings if you have a Cloudflare
       account, or you may send a request to unsubscribe@cloudflare.com
    9. DATA SECURITY, DATA INTEGRITY, AND ACCESS.
       We take all reasonable steps to protect information we receive from
       you from loss, misuse or unauthorized access, disclosure,
       alteration, and/or destruction. We have put in place appropriate
       physical, technical, and administrative measures to safeguard and
       secure your information, and we make use of privacy-enhancing
       technologies such as encryption. If you have any questions about
       the security of your personal information, you can contact us at
       privacyquestions@cloudflare.com.
   10. REGISTRAR.
       If you purchase a domain name from Cloudflare’s registrar service,
       ICANN (The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) and
       the relevant registry operators overseeing the domain’s top-level
       domain require us to collect registrant data for the purposes of
       domain registration and via the WHOIS protocol. We may also be
       required to share this public data with ICANN, the relevant
       registry operators and other such providers with whom we contract
       in order to provide our domain name services, and additionally upon
       the legitimate request of third parties. Registrant data may
       include the domain name, registrant name and other contact
       information, and domain name server information. Learn more.
   11. NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES.
       If we make changes to this Policy that we believe materially impact
       the privacy of your personal data, we will promptly provide notice
       of any such changes (and, where necessary, obtain consent), as well
       as post the updated Policy on this website noting the effective
       date of any changes.
   12. BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS.
       We may assign or transfer this Policy, as well as information
       covered by this Policy, in the event of a merger, sale, change in
       control, or reorganization of all or part of our business.
   13. ENGLISH LANGUAGE CONTROLS.
       Non-English translations of this Policy are provided for
       convenience only. In the event of any ambiguity or conflict between
       translations, the English version is authoritative and controls.
   14. DISPUTE RESOLUTION.
       If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have
       not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third
       party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at
       https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request.

   Effective March 14, 2019

   We have updated our October 25, 2018 privacy policy to list our German
   entity as our legal representative entity in the EU and to add the
   contact information for our new office in Sydney, Australia.
     __________________________________________________________________

   This Cloudflare Privacy Policy (“Policy”) outlines the information that
   Cloudflare, Inc. (“Cloudflare”, “we”, “us” or “our”) gathers, how we
   use that information, and the options you have to access, correct, or
   delete such information.
     __________________________________________________________________

CLOUDFLARE’S PROMISE

   Our mission to help build a better Internet is rooted in the importance
   we place on establishing trust with our Customers, Website Visitors,
   and the Internet community globally. To earn and maintain that trust,
   we commit to communicating transparently, providing security, and
   protecting the privacy of data on our systems.

   We keep your personal information personal and private. We will not
   sell, rent, share, or otherwise disclose your personal information to
   anyone except as necessary to provide our services or as otherwise
   described in this Policy without first providing you with notice and
   the opportunity to consent.
    1. POLICY APPLICATION.
       This Policy applies to Cloudflare’s collection, use, and disclosure
       of the information of the following categories of individuals:
          + Attendees: Individuals who provide their information to
            Cloudflare or Cloudflare representatives when they attend or
            register to attend Cloudflare-sponsored events or other events
            at which Cloudflare participates.
          + Website Visitors: Individuals who visit our Websites and who
            may opt to provide an email address to receive communications
            from Cloudflare. For the purposes of this Policy, “Websites”
            shall refer collectively to www.cloudflare.com as well as any
            other websites Cloudflare owns and that link to this Policy.
            For clarity, “Websites” does not include any sites owned or
            operated by our Customers, including where we serve as
            Registrar.
          + Customers: Those who register on their own or on behalf of an
            entity or organization to use any of the Cloudflare Services
            (as defined below), including administrators on a Customer
            account. For the purposes of this Policy, “Services” shall
            refer to all network service solutions marketed for
            subscription at www.cloudflare.com, including when Services
            are sold by an authorized partner or reseller.
          + Resolver Users: Individuals who use Cloudflare’s Recursive
            Domain Name System (“DNS”) Resolver services, such as the
            1.1.1.1 Resolver. Learn more about 1.1.1.1.
          + End Users: Individuals who visit our Customers’ websites and
            whose information we process in order to provide the Services
            to our Customers pursuant to our agreements with them.
       This Policy does not apply to our Customers’ websites, which may
       have their own terms and privacy policies. Our Customers are solely
       responsible for establishing policies for and ensuring compliance
       with all applicable laws and regulations, including those relating
       to the collection of personal information in connection with the
       use of our Services by End Users with whom our Customers interact.
       Cloudflare’s Websites and Services are not intended for, nor
       designed to attract, individuals under the age of eighteen.
       Cloudflare does not knowingly collect personally identifiable
       information from any person under the age of eighteen.
    2. INFORMATION WE COLLECT.
       Attendees:
          + We may ask for and collect personal information such as your
            name, address, phone number and email address when you
            register for or attend a sponsored event or other events at
            which Cloudflare (and/or its representatives) participates.
       Website Visitors:
          + Name, email address, and other contact information. We ask for
            and—at your option—collect personal information from you when
            you submit web forms on our Websites, including opportunities
            to sign up for and agree to receive email communications from
            us. We also may ask you to submit such personal information if
            you choose to use interactive features of the Websites,
            including participation in surveys, contests, promotions,
            sweepstakes, requesting customer support, or otherwise
            communicating with us. We will send such communications in
            accordance with applicable law.
          + Log Files. Just as when you visit and interact with most
            websites and services delivered via the Internet, when you
            visit our Websites, including the Cloudflare Community Forum,
            we gather certain information and store it in log files. This
            information may include but is not limited to Internet
            Protocol (IP) addresses, system configuration information,
            URLs of referring pages, and locale and language preferences.
          + Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies. We may use cookies
            and other information gathering technologies for a variety of
            purposes, such as providing us with information about how you
            interact with our Websites and assisting us in our marketing
            efforts. You can control how websites use cookies by
            configuring your browser's privacy settings (please refer to
            your browser's help function to learn more about cookie
            controls). Note that if you disable cookies entirely,
            Cloudflare’s Websites may not function properly. We may also
            use cookies and similar technologies to provide you
            advertising on third-party sites based upon your browsing
            activities and interests. If you wish not to have this
            information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based
            ads, you may opt-out by clicking here (or if located in the
            European Union, click here). For more information about the
            cookies Cloudflare uses, please see our Cookie Policy.
          + Interactive Areas. The Websites may offer publicly accessible
            blogs, community forums, comments sections, discussion forums,
            or other interactive features (“Interactive Areas”). If you
            choose to participate in any of these Interactive Areas,
            please be aware that any information that you post in an
            Interactive Area might be read, collected, and used by others
            who access it. If you wish to remove your personal information
            from any of our Interactive Areas, please see the section
            below entitled, Your Data Rights.
       Customers:
          + Customer Account Information. When you register for a
            Cloudflare account, we collect your email address. We will
            also ask you to enter your website domain in order to
            participate in the Services. We refer to this information as
            “Customer Account Information” for the purposes of this
            Policy. Customer Account Information is required to identify
            you as a Customer and permit you to access your account(s). By
            voluntarily providing us with such Customer Account
            Information, you represent that you are the owner of such
            personal data or otherwise have the requisite consent to
            provide it to us.
          + Payment Information. You are not required to enter your credit
            card information unless and until you decide to continue with
            a paid subscription to our Services. When you sign up for one
            of our paid Services, you must provide billing information.
            The information you will need to submit depends on which
            billing method you choose. For example, if you pay with a
            credit card, we will collect your card information and billing
            address, although we do not store full credit card numbers or
            personal account numbers.
       Resolver Users:
          + We will collect limited DNS query data that is sent to the
            resolvers. This data does not contain user IP addresses or any
            other personally identifiable information, and the bulk of the
            data is only stored for 24 hours. You can learn more about our
            1.1.1.1 commitment to privacy here and here.
       End Users:
          + Cloudflare provides web optimization and security services
            that our Customers use to improve and protect their websites,
            including a reverse proxy, pass-through security service, and
            a content distribution network. Because Cloudflare is a
            reverse proxy, our IP addresses may appear in WHOIS and DNS
            records for websites using our Services. We are a conduit for
            information controlled by others. It is our Customers and
            their users who are responsible for the content transmitted
            across our network (e.g., images, written content, graphics,
            etc.).
          + We collect End Users’ information when they use our Customers’
            websites, web applications, and APIs. This information may
            include but is not limited to IP addresses, system
            configuration information, and other information about traffic
            to and from Customers’ websites (collectively, “Log Data”). We
            collect and use Log Data to operate, maintain, and improve our
            Services in performance of our obligations under our Customer
            agreements. For example, Log Data can help us to detect new
            threats, identify malicious third parties, and provide more
            robust security protection for our Customers.
       Legal Basis for Processing (EEA only):
       If you are an individual from the European Economic Area (EEA),
       please note that our legal basis for collecting and using your
       personal information will depend on the personal information
       collected and the specific context in which we collect it. We
       normally will collect personal information from you only where: (a)
       we have your consent to do so, (b) where we need your personal
       information to perform a contract with you (e.g. to deliver the
       Cloudflare Services you have requested), or (c) where the
       processing is in our legitimate interests. Please note that in most
       cases, if you do not provide the requested information, Cloudflare
       will not be able to provide the requested service to you.
       In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect
       personal information from you, or may otherwise need the personal
       information to protect your vital interests or those of another
       person.
       Where we rely on your consent to process your personal data, you
       have the right to withdraw or decline consent at any time. Where we
       rely on our legitimate interests to process your personal data, you
       have the right to object.
       If you have any questions about or need further information
       concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your
       personal information, please contact us at
       privacyquestions@cloudflare.com.
    3. HOW WE USE INFORMATION WE COLLECT.
       Cloudflare only processes personal information in a way that is
       compatible with and relevant for the purpose for which it was
       collected or authorized. As a general matter, for all categories of
       data we collect except Resolver User data, we may use the
       information we collect (including personal information, to the
       extent applicable) to:
          + provide, operate, maintain, improve, and promote the Website
            and Services;

            alerts, and support and administrative messages;
          + send commercial communications, in accordance with your
            communication preferences, such as providing you with
            information about products and services, features, surveys,
            newsletters, offers, promotions, contests, and events about us
            and our partners; and send other news or information about us
            and our partners. See Section 8 below for information on
            managing your communication preferences.
          + process and deliver contest or sweepstakes entries and
            rewards;
          + monitor and analyze trends, usage, and activities in
            connection with the Websites and Services and for marketing or
            advertising purposes;
          + comply with legal obligations as well as to investigate and
            prevent fraudulent transactions, unauthorized access to the
            Services, and other illegal activities;
          + personalize the Websites and Services, including by providing
            features or content that match your interests and preferences;
            and
          + process for other purposes for which we obtain your consent.
       Resolver Users. We use information we collect from Resolver Users
       to operate and improve the Cloudflare Resolver, such as to assist
       us in our debugging efforts if an issue arises. We will not combine
       the information collected from DNS queries with any other
       Cloudflare or third party data in any way that can be used to
       identify individual end users. Learn more.
       Information from Third Party Services. We may combine information
       we collect as described above with personal information we obtain
       from third parties. For example, we may combine information entered
       on a Cloudflare sales submission form with information we receive
       from a third-party sales intelligence platform vendor to enhance
       our ability to market our Services to Customers or potential
       Customers.
    4. INFORMATION SHARING.
       We work with other companies who help us run our business (“Service
       Providers”). These companies provide services to help us deliver
       customer support, process credit card payments, manage and contact
       our existing Customers as well as sales leads, provide marketing
       support, and otherwise operate and improve our Services. These
       Service Providers may only process personal information pursuant to
       our instructions and in compliance both with this Privacy Policy
       and other applicable confidentiality and security measures and
       regulations, including our obligations under the EU-US and Swiss-US
       Privacy Shield frameworks described in Section 6, below.
       Specifically, we do not permit our Service Providers to use any
       personal information we share with them for their own marketing
       purposes or for any other purpose than in connection with the
       services they provide to us.
       In addition to sharing with Service Providers as described above,
       we may also share your information with others in the following
       circumstances:
          + Within the Cloudflare Group (defined for the purposes of this
            Policy as Cloudflare Inc. (United States), Cloudflare Ltd.
            (England), and Cloudflare, Pte. Ltd. (Singapore));
          + With our resellers and other sales partners who may help us
            distribute the Services to Customers;
          + With an app developer when you install an app from our App
            Marketplace;
          + In the event of a merger, sale, change in control, or
            reorganization of all or part of our business;
          + When we are required to disclose personal information to
            respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to
            establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal
            claims. (Learn more about how we handle law enforcement
            requests here);
          + Where we have a good-faith belief sharing is necessary to
            investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal
            activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential
            threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of
            our Service Agreement, or as otherwise required to comply with
            our legal obligations; or
          + as you may otherwise consent from time to time.
       Learn more about information sharing specific to the 1.1.1.1
       Resolver.
       We do not sell, rent, or share personal information with third
       parties for their direct marketing purposes, including as defined
       under California Civil Code Sec. 1798.83.
    5. DATA AGGREGATION.
       Cloudflare may aggregate data we acquire about our Customers and
       their End Users, including the Log Data described above. For
       example, we may assemble data to determine how Web crawlers index
       the Internet and whether they are engaged in malicious activity or
       to compile web traffic reports and statistics. Non-personally
       identifiable, aggregated data may be shared with third parties.
    6. INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION TRANSFERS.
       Cloudflare is a U.S.-based, global company. We primarily store your
       information in the United States and the European Economic Area
       (the “EEA”). To facilitate our global operations, we may transfer
       and access such information from around the world, including from
       other countries in which the Cloudflare Group has operations for
       the purposes described in this Policy.
       Whenever Cloudflare shares personal information originating in the
       EEA or Switzerland with a Cloudflare entity outside the EEA or
       Switzerland, it will do so on the basis of the EU standard
       contractual clauses or the Privacy Shield Frameworks detailed in
       this section.
       If you are accessing or using our Websites or Services or otherwise
       providing information to us, you are agreeing to the transfer of
       your personal information to the United States and other
       jurisdictions in which we operate.
       Cloudflare is certified under both the EU-U.S. and the Swiss-U.S.
       Privacy Shield Frameworks as set forth by the U.S. Department of
       Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal
       information transferred from the EEA and Switzerland to the United
       States, respectively. If there is any conflict between the terms in
       this Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield
       Principles shall govern. For more information on the EU-U.S.
       Privacy Shield or Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield, please visit the U.S.
       Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield website at:
       https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome.
    7. DATA SUBJECT RIGHTS.
       Attendees, Website Visitors, and Customers: You have the right to
       access, correct, update, export, or delete your personal
       information. You may email us at SAR@cloudflare.com with any such
       subject access requests (“SAR”), and we will respond within thirty
       (30) days. Customers also can access, correct, export, or update
       their Account Information by editing their profile or organization
       record at cloudflare.com.
       Resolver Users: We do not retain any personally identifiable
       information about Resolver Users that would be subject to the data
       subject rights described above.
       End Users: Cloudflare has no direct relationship with End Users.
       Even where “Cloudflare” may be indicated as the authoritative name
       server for a domain, unless Cloudflare is the owner of that domain,
       we have no control over a domain’s content. Accordingly, we rely
       upon our Customers to comply with the underlying legal requirements
       for subject access requests. If an End User requests that we
       access, correct, update, or delete their information, or no longer
       wishes to be contacted by one of our Customers that use our
       Services, we will direct that End User to contact the Customer
       website(s) with which they interacted directly. Our Customers are
       solely responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable laws
       and regulations with respect to their website users.
       For any SAR, we will need to verify a requestor is inquiring about
       their own information before we can assist. Where a SAR may
       implicate the personal data of another individual, we must balance
       the request against the risk of violating another person’s privacy
       rights. We will comply with SARs to the extent required by
       applicable law or the US-Swiss or US-EU Privacy Shield. In the EU,
       you also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory
       authority.
    8. COMMUNICATION PREFERENCES.
       You may manage your receipt of commercial communications by
       clicking on the “unsubscribe” link located on the bottom of such
       emails, through your account settings if you have a Cloudflare
       account, or you may send a request to unsubscribe@cloudflare.com
    9. DATA SECURITY, DATA INTEGRITY, AND ACCESS.
       We take all reasonable steps to protect information we receive from
       you from loss, misuse or unauthorized access, disclosure,
       alteration, and/or destruction. We have put in place appropriate
       physical, technical, and administrative measures to safeguard and
       secure your information, and we make use of privacy-enhancing
       technologies such as encryption. If you have any questions about
       the security of your personal information, you can contact us at
       privacyquestions@cloudflare.com.
   10. REGISTRAR.
       If you purchase a domain name from Cloudflare’s registrar service,
       ICANN (The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) and
       the relevant registry operators overseeing the domain’s top-level
       domain require us to collect registrant data for the purposes of
       domain registration and via the WHOIS protocol. We may also be
       required to share this public data with ICANN, the relevant
       registry operators and other such providers with whom we contract
       in order to provide our domain name services, and additionally upon
       the legitimate request of third parties. Registrant data may
       include the domain name, registrant name and other contact
       information, and domain name server information. Learn more.
   11. NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES.
       If we make changes to this Policy that we believe materially impact
       the privacy of your personal data, we will promptly provide notice
       of any such changes (and, where necessary, obtain consent), as well
       as post the updated Policy on this website noting the effective
       date of any changes.
   12. BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS.
       We may assign or transfer this Policy, as well as information
       covered by this Policy, in the event of a merger, sale, change in
       control, or reorganization of all or part of our business.
   13. ENGLISH LANGUAGE CONTROLS.
       Non-English translations of this Policy are provided for
       convenience only. In the event of any ambiguity or conflict between
       translations, the English version is authoritative and controls.
   14. DISPUTE RESOLUTION.
       If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have
       not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third
       party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at
       https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request.
