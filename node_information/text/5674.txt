Features

   jsDelivr provides mirrors for npm, GitHub, WordPress plugins, and
   custom endpoints for several other projects with special requirements.
   If our regular endpoints don't work for your use case, let us know and
   we'll figure something out!

   If you are a package author, check our tips for package authors to make
   using your package as easy as possible.

npm CDN

   We use a permanent S3 storage to ensure all files remain available even
   if npm goes down, or a package is deleted by its author. Files are
   fetched directly from npm only the first time, or when S3 goes down.

   Load any project hosted on npm:
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/package@version/file

   Load an exact version of a file:
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.2.1/dist/jquery.min.js

   Use a version range instead of an exact version:
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3/dist/jquery.min.js
                                        https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.1/
dist/jquery.min.js

   If you use this feature and a file you requested is not available in
   the newest version of the package, the link will keep working thanks to
   our version-fallback feature. We'll continue to serve the file from
   older version of the package instead of failing with a 404 error.

   Load by tag (not recommended for production usage):
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@beta/dist/jquery.min.js

   Omit the version completely or use "latest" to load the latest one (not
   recommended for production usage):
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@latest/dist/jquery.min.js
                                        https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery/dist
/jquery.min.js

   Requesting the latest version (as opposed to "latest major" or "latest
   minor") is dangerous because major versions usually come with breaking
   changes. Only do this if you really know what you are doing.

   Add ".min" to any JS/CSS file to get a minified version - if one
   doesn't exist, we'll generate it for you. All generated files come with
   source maps and can be easily used during development:
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/github-markdown-css@2.4.1/github-markdown.min.css

   Minifying a large file can take several seconds. However, we store all
   generated files in our permanent storage, so this delay only applies to
   the first few requests.
   Omit the file path to get the default file (currently not recommended).
   This file is always minified:
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.2.1
                                        https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3
                                        https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery

   If the default file is not directly in the root directory of the
   package, using this feature may cause problems with relative imports,
   such as source maps, images, or font files referenced by the requested
   file.

   Get a directory listing:
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.2.1/
                                        https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.2.
1/dist/

GitHub CDN

   We recommend using npm for projects that support it for better UX - npm
   packages are searchable on our website, and package pages show
   additional useful information, such as description and link to
   homepage.
   We use a permanent S3 storage to ensure all files remain available even
   if GitHub goes down, or a repository or a release is deleted by its
   author. Files are fetched directly from GitHub only the first time, or
   when S3 goes down.

   Load any GitHub release, commit, or branch:
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/user/repo@version/file

   Load an exact version of a file:
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jquery/jquery@3.2.1/dist/jquery.min.js
                                        https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jquery/jquer
y@32b00373b3f42e5cdcb709df53f3b08b7184a944/dist/jquery.min.js

   Use a version range instead of an exact version:
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jquery/jquery@3.2/dist/jquery.min.js
                                        https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jquery/jquer
y@3/dist/jquery.min.js

   If you use this feature and a file you requested is not available in
   the newest release, the link will keep working thanks to our
   version-fallback feature. We'll continue to serve the file from older
   release instead of failing with a 404 error.

   Omit the version completely or use "latest" to load the latest one (not
   recommended for production usage):
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jquery/jquery@latest/dist/jquery.min.js
                                        https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jquery/jquer
y/dist/jquery.min.js

   Requesting the latest version (as opposed to "latest major" or "latest
   minor") is dangerous because major versions usually come with breaking
   changes. Only do this if you really know what you are doing.

   Add ".min" to any JS/CSS file to get a minified version - if one
   doesn't exist, we'll generate it for you. All generated files come with
   source maps and can be easily used during development:
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jquery/jquery@3.2.1/src/core.min.js

   Minifying a large file can take several seconds. However, we store all
   generated files in our permanent storage, so this delay only applies to
   the first few requests.

   Get a directory listing:
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jquery/jquery@3.2.1/
                                        https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jquery/jquer
y@3.2.1/dist/

Combine multiple files

   Our combine endpoint allows you to load several files from npm and
   GitHub endpoints in one request:
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/combine/url1,url2,url3

   All features that work for individual files (version ranges,
   minification, etc.) work here as well. All combined files come with
   source maps and can be easily used during development.
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/combine/gh/jquery/jquery@3.2/dist/jquery.min.js,gh/twbs
/bootstrap@3.3/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js
                                        https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/combine/npm/boo
tstrap@3.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css,npm/bootstrap@3.3/dist/css/bootstrap-theme
.min.css

   Combining large/many files can take several seconds. However, we store
   all generated files in our permanent storage, so this delay only
   applies to the first few requests.

WordPress CDN

   Load any plugin from the WordPress.org plugins SVN repo:
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/wp/plugins/project/tags/version/file

   Load an exact version of a file:
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/wp/plugins/wp-slimstat/tags/4.6.5/wp-slimstat.js

   Load the latest version (not recommended for production usage):
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/wp/plugins/wp-slimstat/trunk/wp-slimstat.js

   Requesting the latest version is dangerous because a new version may
   come with breaking changes. Only do this if you really know what you
   are doing.

   Load any theme from the WordPress.org themes SVN repo:
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/wp/themes/project/version/file

   Load an exact version of a file:
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/wp/themes/twenty-eightteen/1.7/assets/js/html5.js

   Add ".min" to any JS/CSS file to get a minified version - if one
   doesn't exist, we'll generate it for you. All generated files come with
   source maps and can be easily used during development:
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/wp/themes/twenty-eightteen/1.7/assets/js/html5.min.js

Custom endpoints

   We provide custom endpoints for the following projects (contact us if
   you need one too):
     * emojione.com
     * foundation.zurb.com
     * hex.pm
     * jspm.io
     * webjars.org

Tips for package authors

     * make sure the provided files work in browser (use UMD)
     * use semver for versioning (this is enforced by npm but not by
       GitHub)
     * if you distribute minified JS/CSS files, also include source maps
       for those files
     * if you don't want to provide minified files, it's fine - we'll
       handle that for you

   Configuring a default file in package.json

   For packages hosted on npm, we support setting a "default" file for
   each package. This file is displayed at the top of directory listings
   on our website and available under shorter URL on the CDN. The default
   file can be configured by setting one of the following fields in
   package.json (ordered by priority):
    1. jsdelivr
    2. browser
    3. main

Our network

   [X] Cloudflare [X] Fastly [X] StackPath [X] QUANTIL [X] Other

   Unlike the competition, jsDelivr uses a unique Multi-CDN infrastructure
   built on top of CDN networks provided by StackPath, Cloudflare, Fastly,
   and Quantil. Additionally, we use custom servers in locations where
   CDNs have little or no presence.

   Our smart load balancing system ensures the best possible uptime and
   the best possible performance. Each time a user downloads a file from
   jsDelivr, our algorithm figures out the optimal provider for that
   particular user and that particular time based on the performance and
   availability data for the last few minutes. All that happens within a
   few milliseconds.

   This algorithm also immediately responds to performance degradation.
   For example, if a CDN provider gets DDoSed in Europe and their response
   times increase, jsDelivr will notice the change and simply stop using
   this provider in Europe but still consider it for users in other
   locations.
   [infographic-bg.png] See exactly how jsDelivr works CHECK OUR
   INFOGRAPHIC

Failover on every layer

   We use two independent DNS providers. For jsDelivr to go down, both of
   these companies would have to go down at the same time. Both of our DNS
   providers monitor our load-balanced endpoint and if they detect
   problems they automatically switch all traffic to a single CDN
   provider.

   Our load-balancer monitors the uptime of all CDN providers using both
   RUM and synthetic data. If any of those detect downtime or performance
   degradation, the affected CDN provider is removed immediately.

   Our origin servers are located in several data-centers in different
   states. If a server goes down, the CDNs automatically switch to the
   remaining healthy servers.

   In total, we have one of the most resilient systems out there, ready to
   be used in production by even the largest websites.

Big network in China

   [china-bg.jpg]

   [china-flag.svg] jsDelivr is the only public CDN with a valid ICP
   license issued by the Chinese government, and hundreds of locations
   directly in Mainland China.

Features

   jsDelivr provides mirrors for npm, GitHub, WordPress plugins, and
   custom endpoints for several other projects with special requirements.
   If our regular endpoints don't work for your use case, let us know and
   we'll figure something out!

   If you are a package author, check our tips for package authors to make
   using your package as easy as possible.

npm CDN

   We use a permanent S3 storage to ensure all files remain available even
   if npm goes down, or a package is deleted by its author. Files are
   fetched directly from npm only the first time, or when S3 goes down.

   Load any project hosted on npm:
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/package@version/file

   Load an exact version of a file:
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.2.1/dist/jquery.min.js

   Use a version range instead of an exact version:
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3/dist/jquery.min.js
                                        https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.1/
dist/jquery.min.js

   If you use this feature and a file you requested is not available in
   the newest version of the package, the link will keep working thanks to
   our version-fallback feature. We'll continue to serve the file from
   older version of the package instead of failing with a 404 error.

   Load by tag (not recommended for production usage):
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@beta/dist/jquery.min.js

   Omit the version completely or use "latest" to load the latest one (not
   recommended for production usage):
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@latest/dist/jquery.min.js
                                        https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery/dist
/jquery.min.js

   Requesting the latest version (as opposed to "latest major" or "latest
   minor") is dangerous because major versions usually come with breaking
   changes. Only do this if you really know what you are doing.

   Add ".min" to any JS/CSS file to get a minified version - if one
   doesn't exist, we'll generate it for you. All generated files come with
   source maps and can be easily used during development:
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/github-markdown-css@2.4.1/github-markdown.min.css

   Minifying a large file can take several seconds. However, we store all
   generated files in our permanent storage, so this delay only applies to
   the first few requests.
   Omit the file path to get the default file (currently not recommended).
   This file is always minified:
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.2.1
                                        https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3
                                        https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery

   If the default file is not directly in the root directory of the
   package, using this feature may cause problems with relative imports,
   such as source maps, images, or font files referenced by the requested
   file.

   Get a directory listing:
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.2.1/
                                        https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.2.
1/dist/

GitHub CDN

   We recommend using npm for projects that support it for better UX - npm
   packages are searchable on our website, and package pages show
   additional useful information, such as description and link to
   homepage.
   We use a permanent S3 storage to ensure all files remain available even
   if GitHub goes down, or a repository or a release is deleted by its
   author. Files are fetched directly from GitHub only the first time, or
   when S3 goes down.

   Load any GitHub release, commit, or branch:
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/user/repo@version/file

   Load an exact version of a file:
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jquery/jquery@3.2.1/dist/jquery.min.js
                                        https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jquery/jquer
y@32b00373b3f42e5cdcb709df53f3b08b7184a944/dist/jquery.min.js

   Use a version range instead of an exact version:
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jquery/jquery@3.2/dist/jquery.min.js
                                        https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jquery/jquer
y@3/dist/jquery.min.js

   If you use this feature and a file you requested is not available in
   the newest release, the link will keep working thanks to our
   version-fallback feature. We'll continue to serve the file from older
   release instead of failing with a 404 error.

   Omit the version completely or use "latest" to load the latest one (not
   recommended for production usage):
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jquery/jquery@latest/dist/jquery.min.js
                                        https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jquery/jquer
y/dist/jquery.min.js

   Requesting the latest version (as opposed to "latest major" or "latest
   minor") is dangerous because major versions usually come with breaking
   changes. Only do this if you really know what you are doing.

   Add ".min" to any JS/CSS file to get a minified version - if one
   doesn't exist, we'll generate it for you. All generated files come with
   source maps and can be easily used during development:
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jquery/jquery@3.2.1/src/core.min.js

   Minifying a large file can take several seconds. However, we store all
   generated files in our permanent storage, so this delay only applies to
   the first few requests.

   Get a directory listing:
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jquery/jquery@3.2.1/
                                        https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jquery/jquer
y@3.2.1/dist/

Combine multiple files

   Our combine endpoint allows you to load several files from npm and
   GitHub endpoints in one request:
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/combine/url1,url2,url3

   All features that work for individual files (version ranges,
   minification, etc.) work here as well. All combined files come with
   source maps and can be easily used during development.
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/combine/gh/jquery/jquery@3.2/dist/jquery.min.js,gh/twbs
/bootstrap@3.3/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js
                                        https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/combine/npm/boo
tstrap@3.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css,npm/bootstrap@3.3/dist/css/bootstrap-theme
.min.css

   Combining large/many files can take several seconds. However, we store
   all generated files in our permanent storage, so this delay only
   applies to the first few requests.

WordPress CDN

   Load any plugin from the WordPress.org plugins SVN repo:
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/wp/plugins/project/tags/version/file

   Load an exact version of a file:
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/wp/plugins/wp-slimstat/tags/4.6.5/wp-slimstat.js

   Load the latest version (not recommended for production usage):
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/wp/plugins/wp-slimstat/trunk/wp-slimstat.js

   Requesting the latest version is dangerous because a new version may
   come with breaking changes. Only do this if you really know what you
   are doing.

   Load any theme from the WordPress.org themes SVN repo:
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/wp/themes/project/version/file

   Load an exact version of a file:
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/wp/themes/twenty-eightteen/1.7/assets/js/html5.js

   Add ".min" to any JS/CSS file to get a minified version - if one
   doesn't exist, we'll generate it for you. All generated files come with
   source maps and can be easily used during development:
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/wp/themes/twenty-eightteen/1.7/assets/js/html5.min.js

Custom endpoints

   We provide custom endpoints for the following projects (contact us if
   you need one too):
     * emojione.com
     * foundation.zurb.com
     * hex.pm
     * jspm.io
     * webjars.org

Tips for package authors

     * make sure the provided files work in browser (use UMD)
     * use semver for versioning (this is enforced by npm but not by
       GitHub)
     * if you distribute minified JS/CSS files, also include source maps
       for those files
     * if you don't want to provide minified files, it's fine - we'll
       handle that for you

   Configuring a default file in package.json

   For packages hosted on npm, we support setting a "default" file for
   each package. This file is displayed at the top of directory listings
   on our website and available under shorter URL on the CDN. The default
   file can be configured by setting one of the following fields in
   package.json (ordered by priority):
    1. jsdelivr
    2. browser
    3. main

Our network

   [X] Cloudflare [X] Fastly [X] StackPath [X] QUANTIL [X] Other

   Unlike the competition, jsDelivr uses a unique Multi-CDN infrastructure
   built on top of CDN networks provided by StackPath, Cloudflare, Fastly,
   and Quantil. Additionally, we use custom servers in locations where
   CDNs have little or no presence.

   Our smart load balancing system ensures the best possible uptime and
   the best possible performance. Each time a user downloads a file from
   jsDelivr, our algorithm figures out the optimal provider for that
   particular user and that particular time based on the performance and
   availability data for the last few minutes. All that happens within a
   few milliseconds.

   This algorithm also immediately responds to performance degradation.
   For example, if a CDN provider gets DDoSed in Europe and their response
   times increase, jsDelivr will notice the change and simply stop using
   this provider in Europe but still consider it for users in other
   locations.

   INFOGRAPHIC

Failover on every layer

   We use two independent DNS providers. For jsDelivr to go down, both of
   these companies would have to go down at the same time. Both of our DNS
   providers monitor our load-balanced endpoint and if they detect
   problems they automatically switch all traffic to a single CDN
   provider.

   Our load-balancer monitors the uptime of all CDN providers using both
   RUM and synthetic data. If any of those detect downtime or performance
   degradation, the affected CDN provider is removed immediately.

   Our origin servers are located in several data-centers in different
   states. If a server goes down, the CDNs automatically switch to the
   remaining healthy servers.

   In total, we have one of the most resilient systems out there, ready to
   be used in production by even the largest websites.

Big network in China

   [china-bg.jpg]

   [china-flag.svg] jsDelivr is the only public CDN with a valid ICP
   license issued by the Chinese government, and hundreds of locations
   directly in Mainland China.
