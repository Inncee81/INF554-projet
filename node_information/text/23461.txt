New Paper Trimmer by Stampin’ Up!

   Posted on October 1, 2019 by Linda Tolson Yarbrough

   Papercrafting begins with a beautiful first cut, which means having the
   right tool for the job is kind of a big deal.  The Research &
   Development team at Stampin’ Up! has been hard at work designing a new
   paper trimmer and is now ready to reveal the fruits of their labor. I
   am excited to introduce to you the new Paper Trimmer by Stampin’ Up!

   This highly anticipated new tool is “a cut above the rest”. Here is a
   photo array from its unveiling photo shoot.

   Now THAT is one beautiful Paper Trimmer.

   How can you get one of these new beautiful tools for yourself, you ask?
   Starting today, October 1, a “demonstrator preorder” period begins
   which means for now this is only available for purchase if you are an
   active demonstrator. Good news is that if you sign up to become a
   demonstrator during the preorder period, you can ADD THE PAPER TRIMMER
   as one of the products in your STARTER KIT! If you have been wanting to
   join – here is your sign. Simply contact me for information on how you
   can join the fun and become a demonstrator.

   With all good things, there is an end date for this promotion – October
   31.

   Customer Availability: To ensure we have a sufficient inventory of
   Paper Trimmers for our customers, we will not announce a customer
   release date until we are able to gauge the new product’s inventory
   levels and popularity during the demonstrator preorder period. An
   update will be provided as soon as we have a customer release date.

   I hope you are as excited as I am about this new tool. Here is a short
   video that reflects just how excited.

Toile Tidings for Christmas

   Posted on September 26, 2019 by Linda Tolson Yarbrough

   Greetings my stamping friends! I actually have a project I made using
   new products from the Holiday Catalog – I know; I am as shocked as you
   are!

   I only purchased a few products during the preorder period for
   demonstrators (the month before the catalog goes live to customers) and
   I have been so busy trying to juggle all that I want to try to do that
   I haven’t accomplished much of anything,

   After spending some time a few weekends ago with Amy Storrie in Denton
   at her “Stampin’ Spot” I got some motivation and completed a project I
   had started that is a partial CASE from the Holiday Catalog (page 6).

   I made a few modifications but the layout was inspired by the design
   team of artists at Stampin’ Up! (Thank you!)

   Here are the Stampin’ Up! products that I used in the design of this
   card which can be added to your shopping cart with a quick click on the
   thumbnails below:

   NOTE: For the leaves on the branch with the berries, I used the Garden
   Green pencil from the Watercolor Pencils Assortment 2 collection. I did
   not blend or add any water as I did not want the Memento ink to bleed.

   If you have any other questions regarding the measurements or design
   elements of this card, do not hesitate to ask. I share my card designs
   for FREE.

   Thank you for stopping by today. I hope you leave here inspired to put
   stamps to ink to paper. Until next time, stamp on my friends.

   Linda

   P.S. If you want or need help creating your Christmas Cards for this
   year, consider getting some friends together for a Christmas

Winter Wonders by Paper Pumpkin

   Posted on September 12, 2019 by Linda Tolson Yarbrough

   Greetings my stamping friends.

   Let’s face it. The holiday season will be here before we know it. And
   along with putting up the Christmas tree and spending cold nights by
   the fire, we have gifts to wrap and greeting cards to send out to
   friends and family near and far.

   Stampin’ Up! to the rescue with their next two Paper Pumpkin kits for
   October and November! Winter Wonders will be coordinating kits, but
   each kit is all-inclusive and can stand alone. Here is more information
   about each kit:

   October Kit
     * Makes 10 cards and envelopes
     * Card size: 4 1/4″ x 5-1/2″ (10.8 x 14 cm)
     * Envelope size: 4-1/2″ x 5-3/4″ (11.4 x 14.6 cm)
     * Coordinating colors: Early Espresso, Pool Party, Poppy Parade, and
       Shaded Spruce

   November Kit
     * Makes 24 holiday-themed gift tags of 4 various sizes and designs.
     * Coordinating colors: Early Espresso, Pool Party, Real Red, and
       Shaded Spruce

   Both kits make it easy for you to add a handmade, personal touch to
   your holiday giving—without a lot of fuss. It’s Christmas made easy
   with Paper Pumpkin!

   Whether you are an avid crafter or a beginner, Paper Pumpkin is the
   perfect box of fun and even makes the perfect gift for a friend or that
   crafty person on your holiday list. You can order more than one of each
   kit if you need more cards or tags, or add coordinating products from
   the Annual or Holiday Catalogs to “stretch” your kit’s potential. There
   are always extra bits remaining from each kit so with some extra card
   stock and envelopes the sky is the limit.

   If you have any questions on how a subscription to Paper Pumpkin works,
   please ask me. If you wish to renew or start a new subscription here is
   the link to my page: PaperPumpkin

   To receive the October kit you need to be a subscriber by October 10.
   To receive the November kit you need to be a subscriber by November 10.
   A monthly subscription in the U.S. costs $22.00 + tax (shipping
   included) per kit.

   And to show you just how much fun a Paper Pumpkin box can be, here is a
   new video:

Wood-Mount Stamp Set Destash

   Posted on August 15, 2019 by Linda Tolson Yarbrough

   Greetings my stamping friends. I hope you are all staying cool as the
   Summer season blasts its last rays of heat upon you all. We have been
   fortunate here in my part of Texas so far this year, but I am sure we
   will get at least one “heat wave” before we move into our so-called
   Fall season.

   I have been neglecting my blog and relying on Facebook and Instagram to
   communicate lately so I thought I would send you all a quick post to
   let you know that I have begun posting retired wood-mount stamp sets on
   eBay. There are some REALLY old sets (as far back as 1995) out there if
   you are looking for something different and love the stamps that come
   attached to the wood blocks.

   I started two days ago and am continuing to add items. The listings are
   5-day auctions so most have at least 3 days remaining. You can reach my
   eBay store (lrtolson) HERE.

   I will continue to destash so check back to my eBay stored often so you
   don’t miss your chance for a bargain!

   Thank you for stopping by. Until next time, stamp on my friends.

August Paper Pumpkin Sneak Peek

   Posted on July 18, 2019 by Linda Tolson Yarbrough

   Are you done with the heat of Summer? I know I am and we really haven’t
   hit the triple digit heat we typically have here in the heart of Texas,
   but with the amount of rain we have had so far this year the humidity
   it off the charts!

   With the August Paper Pumpkin Kit Stampin’ Up! is opening the door to
   the coziness of fall with a project of gift bags and tags featuring the
   rich colors of fall leaves. But wait a minute if you are disappointed
   that this is not a card kit – because for the first time ever (I think
   I have been saying that a lot this year – they are really going above
   and beyond this year!) – there will be an add-on bundle option
   available on August 1 while supplies last.

   This bundle will include 24 card bases (12 each of two designs) with
   coordinating envelopes for $10.00! This add-on bundle will not
   automatically ship to all Paper Pumpkin subscribers who receive the
   August kit. If you want the card bases add-on bundle you must place a
   separate order either through your demonstrator or stampinup.com.

   Now that is an amazing kit and add-on bundle! I hope I remember to
   place my order for the add-on before they sell out!

   If you are not already a Paper Pumpkin subscriber, you can subscribe
   monthly HERE, or purchase 1, 3, 6 or 12-month pre-paid subscriptions.
   These kits also make great gifts for the crafter in your life who is
   hard to shop for.
   Product List
   1-Month Prepaid Paper Pumpkin Subscription
   1-Month Prepaid Paper Pumpkin Subscription
   [137858]
   $21.00
   3-Month Prepaid Paper Pumpkin Subscription
   3-Month Prepaid Paper Pumpkin Subscription
   [137859]
   $63.00
   6-Month Prepaid Paper Pumpkin Subscription
   6-Month Prepaid Paper Pumpkin Subscription

   $114.00
   One year Prepaid Paper Pumpkin Subscription
   One year Prepaid Paper Pumpkin Subscription
   [137861]
   $220.00

   If you have any questions about becoming a subscriber or how to get the
   add-on bundle for the August kit, do not hesitate to contact me. The
   last day to subscribe for the August kit is August 10, 2019.

   Thank you for stopping by today. Until next time, stamp on my friends.

Celebrating 10 Years with Stampin’ Up!

   Posted on July 17, 2019 by Linda Tolson Yarbrough

   Greetings my stamping friends! July 16th marked my 10 year Anniversary
   as a Stampin’ Up! demonstrator! Woohoo!!!

   Help me celebrate my Anniversary!

   As a token of my appreciation to my customers, if you place a minimum
   $50.00 order through my demonstrator website now through the end of
   July 2019, you will receive a FREE gift from me consisting of five (5)
   hand-made cards of random designs PLUS your choice of Faceted Gems in
   either Clear or Gold (see page 178 of the Annual Catalog). These FREE
   gifts will be shipped to you from me in August.

   HOST CODE: MXE6VNYA

   I have created a Work Shop Host Code as reflected above for you to use
   so that I, as the hostess, can receive the accumulative hostess
   benefits for orders that are less than $150.00. If your order is
   $150.00 or more, do not use the host code, you will want the hostess
   benefits for yourself!

   Bonus Days!

   And don’t forget that you earn a $5.00 coupon that you can use in
   August for every $50.00 you spend in July (before taxes and shipping)
   in July!

   From now until August 31, new demonstrators will receive an additional
   $30 US to put toward bonus products in their Starter Kit. THEN, they’ll
   receive a $10 US coupon code the following month.

   So what does this mean to you? A Starter Kit is $99.00 in the US. For
   that fee, you now select $155.00 worth of Stampin’ Up! products. Plus,
   the following month you will have a $10.00 US coupon to use towards
   anything else you wish to purchase. The best thing about the Starter
   Kit is that it is 100% customizable by YOU. You are not required to
   purchase anything that you do not want or need. Of course, if you are
   not sure what you would need, we have a recommended supply list ready
   for you to use as a reference.

   What are the benefits of becoming a Stampin’ Up! demonstrator? You
   immediately begin receiving a 20-25% discount or commission (depending
   on your title) on all purchases or customer sales. You have access to a
   large community of like-minded creative artists who love to share what
   they do. You are among the first to hear about the new and exciting
   products offered by Stampin’ Up!, including the new catalogs a month or
   more before they are released to the general public — PREORDER! OnStage
   events and making new friends. And so much more.

   What are you waiting for? I would love to help you sign up and have you
   as one of my team members. That would be an awesome way to celebrate my
   10 year Anniversary!

   Thank you for stopping by today. Until next time, stamp on my friends.

Pressed Petals Greetings

   Posted on July 15, 2019 by Linda Tolson Yarbrough

   Greetings my stamping friends. I have been pinging around between
   projects and thought I’d take a moment and share with you two I finally
   finished!

   The new Annual Catalog that was released in June has an amazing
   selection of designer series paper to pick from and one of my favorites
   is the Pressed Petals Specialty:

   It looks like freshly pressed flowers and makes creating beautiful
   projects a snap. Here are two cards designs I made using this paper as
   my main design element.

   I just love how the flowers and leaves seem to pop out of the paper.
   Makes my creative process easy once I get up the nerve to cut it that
   is.

   Here are the Stampin’ Up! products that I used in the designs of these
   cards:

   If you have any questions regarding the design of these cards, do not
   hesitate to ask. I always share my project designs for FREE!

   I have several more projects to share with you if I can ever focus my
   energy on one thing at a time. It’s been hard to do that lately, but I
   will try.

   Thank you for stopping by today. I hope you leave here inspired to put
   stamps to ink to paper. Until next time, stamp on my friends.

New Paper Trimmer by Stampin’ Up!

   Posted on October 1, 2019 by Linda Tolson Yarbrough

   Papercrafting begins with a beautiful first cut, which means having the
   right tool for the job is kind of a big deal.  The Research &
   Development team at Stampin’ Up! has been hard at work designing a new
   paper trimmer and is now ready to reveal the fruits of their labor. I
   am excited to introduce to you the new Paper Trimmer by Stampin’ Up!

   This highly anticipated new tool is “a cut above the rest”. Here is a
   photo array from its unveiling photo shoot.

   Now THAT is one beautiful Paper Trimmer.

   How can you get one of these new beautiful tools for yourself, you ask?
   Starting today, October 1, a “demonstrator preorder” period begins
   which means for now this is only available for purchase if you are an
   active demonstrator. Good news is that if you sign up to become a
   demonstrator during the preorder period, you can ADD THE PAPER TRIMMER
   as one of the products in your STARTER KIT! If you have been wanting to
   join – here is your sign. Simply contact me for information on how you
   can join the fun and become a demonstrator.

   With all good things, there is an end date for this promotion – October
   31.

   Customer Availability: To ensure we have a sufficient inventory of
   Paper Trimmers for our customers, we will not announce a customer
   release date until we are able to gauge the new product’s inventory
   levels and popularity during the demonstrator preorder period. An
   update will be provided as soon as we have a customer release date.

   I hope you are as excited as I am about this new tool. Here is a short
   video that reflects just how excited.

Toile Tidings for Christmas

   Posted on September 26, 2019 by Linda Tolson Yarbrough

   Greetings my stamping friends! I actually have a project I made using
   new products from the Holiday Catalog – I know; I am as shocked as you
   are!

   I only purchased a few products during the preorder period for
   demonstrators (the month before the catalog goes live to customers) and
   I have been so busy trying to juggle all that I want to try to do that
   I haven’t accomplished much of anything,

   After spending some time a few weekends ago with Amy Storrie in Denton
   at her “Stampin’ Spot” I got some motivation and completed a project I
   had started that is a partial CASE from the Holiday Catalog (page 6).

   I made a few modifications but the layout was inspired by the design
   team of artists at Stampin’ Up! (Thank you!)

   Here are the Stampin’ Up! products that I used in the design of this
   card which can be added to your shopping cart with a quick click on the
   thumbnails below:

   NOTE: For the leaves on the branch with the berries, I used the Garden
   Green pencil from the Watercolor Pencils Assortment 2 collection. I did
   not blend or add any water as I did not want the Memento ink to bleed.

   If you have any other questions regarding the measurements or design
   elements of this card, do not hesitate to ask. I share my card designs
   for FREE.

   Thank you for stopping by today. I hope you leave here inspired to put
   stamps to ink to paper. Until next time, stamp on my friends.

   Linda

   P.S. If you want or need help creating your Christmas Cards for this
   year, consider getting some friends together for a Christmas
   “Stamp-a-Stack”. I can organize it for you. Contact me for more
   information!

Winter Wonders by Paper Pumpkin

   Posted on September 12, 2019 by Linda Tolson Yarbrough

   Greetings my stamping friends.

   Let’s face it. The holiday season will be here before we know it. And
   along with putting up the Christmas tree and spending cold nights by
   the fire, we have gifts to wrap and greeting cards to send out to
   friends and family near and far.

   Stampin’ Up! to the rescue with their next two Paper Pumpkin kits for
   October and November! Winter Wonders will be coordinating kits, but
   each kit is all-inclusive and can stand alone. Here is more information
   about each kit:

   October Kit
     * Makes 10 cards and envelopes
     * Card size: 4 1/4″ x 5-1/2″ (10.8 x 14 cm)
     * Envelope size: 4-1/2″ x 5-3/4″ (11.4 x 14.6 cm)
     * Coordinating colors: Early Espresso, Pool Party, Poppy Parade, and
       Shaded Spruce

   November Kit
     * Makes 24 holiday-themed gift tags of 4 various sizes and designs.
     * Coordinating colors: Early Espresso, Pool Party, Real Red, and
       Shaded Spruce

   Both kits make it easy for you to add a handmade, personal touch to
   your holiday giving—without a lot of fuss. It’s Christmas made easy
   with Paper Pumpkin!

   Whether you are an avid crafter or a beginner, Paper Pumpkin is the
   perfect box of fun and even makes the perfect gift for a friend or that
   crafty person on your holiday list. You can order more than one of each
   kit if you need more cards or tags, or add coordinating products from
   the Annual or Holiday Catalogs to “stretch” your kit’s potential. There
   are always extra bits remaining from each kit so with some extra card
   stock and envelopes the sky is the limit.

   If you have any questions on how a subscription to Paper Pumpkin works,
   please ask me. If you wish to renew or start a new subscription here is
   the link to my page: PaperPumpkin

   To receive the October kit you need to be a subscriber by October 10.
   To receive the November kit you need to be a subscriber by November 10.
   A monthly subscription in the U.S. costs $22.00 + tax (shipping
   included) per kit.

   And to show you just how much fun a Paper Pumpkin box can be, here is a
   new video:

Stampin’ Up! September – Better than Pumpkin Spice!

   Posted on September 6, 2019 by Linda Tolson Yarbrough

   Greetings my stamping friends. It’s finally here! September. The month
   that most mere mortals count down to as it means everything “Pumpkin
   Spice” flavored is coming to their favorite coffee house or restaurant.

   But for those of us with more serious “tastes”, we know this means the
   release of the Stampin’ Up! Holiday Catalog has arrived!

   I don’t know how they manage to do it, but Stampin’ Up! has once again
   hit it out of the park with the products they have to offer in this
   catalog. Enjoy this Stop-Motion video to get a glimpse of just a few of
   the items.

Wood-Mount Stamp Set Destash

   Posted on August 15, 2019 by Linda Tolson Yarbrough

   Greetings my stamping friends. I hope you are all staying cool as the
   Summer season blasts its last rays of heat upon you all. We have been
   fortunate here in my part of Texas so far this year, but I am sure we
   will get at least one “heat wave” before we move into our so-called
   Fall season.

   I have been neglecting my blog and relying on Facebook and Instagram to
   communicate lately so I thought I would send you all a quick post to
   let you know that I have begun posting retired wood-mount stamp sets on
   eBay. There are some REALLY old sets (as far back as 1995) out there if
   you are looking for something different and love the stamps that come
   attached to the wood blocks.

   I started two days ago and am continuing to add items. The listings are
   5-day auctions so most have at least 3 days remaining. You can reach my
   eBay store (lrtolson) HERE.

   I will continue to destash so check back to my eBay stored often so you
   don’t miss your chance for a bargain!

   Thank you for stopping by. Until next time, stamp on my friends.

   Linda

August Paper Pumpkin Sneak Peek

   Posted on July 18, 2019 by Linda Tolson Yarbrough

   Are you done with the heat of Summer? I know I am and we really haven’t
   hit the triple digit heat we typically have here in the heart of Texas,
   but with the amount of rain we have had so far this year the humidity
   it off the charts!

   With the August Paper Pumpkin Kit Stampin’ Up! is opening the door to
   the coziness of fall with a project of gift bags and tags featuring the
   rich colors of fall leaves. But wait a minute if you are disappointed
   that this is not a card kit – because for the first time ever (I think
   I have been saying that a lot this year – they are really going above
   and beyond this year!) – there will be an add-on bundle option
   available on August 1 while supplies last.

   This bundle will include 24 card bases (12 each of two designs) with
   coordinating envelopes for $10.00! This add-on bundle will not
   automatically ship to all Paper Pumpkin subscribers who receive the
   August kit. If you want the card bases add-on bundle you must place a
   separate order either through your demonstrator or stampinup.com.

   Now that is an amazing kit and add-on bundle! I hope I remember to
   place my order for the add-on before they sell out!

   If you are not already a Paper Pumpkin subscriber, you can subscribe
   monthly HERE, or purchase 1, 3, 6 or 12-month pre-paid subscriptions.
   These kits also make great gifts for the crafter in your life who is
   hard to shop for.
   Product List

   last day to subscribe for the August kit is August 10, 2019.

   Thank you for stopping by today. Until next time, stamp on my friends.

Celebrating 10 Years with Stampin’ Up!

   Posted on July 17, 2019 by Linda Tolson Yarbrough

   Greetings my stamping friends! July 16th marked my 10 year Anniversary
   as a Stampin’ Up! demonstrator! Woohoo!!!

   Help me celebrate my Anniversary!

   As a token of my appreciation to my customers, if you place a minimum
   $50.00 order through my demonstrator website now through the end of
   July 2019, you will receive a FREE gift from me consisting of five (5)
   hand-made cards of random designs PLUS your choice of Faceted Gems in
   either Clear or Gold (see page 178 of the Annual Catalog). These FREE
   gifts will be shipped to you from me in August.

   HOST CODE: MXE6VNYA

   I have created a Work Shop Host Code as reflected above for you to use
   so that I, as the hostess, can receive the accumulative hostess
   benefits for orders that are less than $150.00. If your order is
   $150.00 or more, do not use the host code, you will want the hostess
   benefits for yourself!

   Bonus Days!

   And don’t forget that you earn a $5.00 coupon that you can use in
   August for every $50.00 you spend in July (before taxes and shipping)
   in July!

   From now until August 31, new demonstrators will receive an additional
   $30 US to put toward bonus products in their Starter Kit. THEN, they’ll
   receive a $10 US coupon code the following month.

   So what does this mean to you? A Starter Kit is $99.00 in the US. For
   that fee, you now select $155.00 worth of Stampin’ Up! products. Plus,
   the following month you will have a $10.00 US coupon to use towards
   anything else you wish to purchase. The best thing about the Starter
   Kit is that it is 100% customizable by YOU. You are not required to
   purchase anything that you do not want or need. Of course, if you are
   not sure what you would need, we have a recommended supply list ready
   for you to use as a reference.

   What are the benefits of becoming a Stampin’ Up! demonstrator? You
   immediately begin receiving a 20-25% discount or commission (depending
   on your title) on all purchases or customer sales. You have access to a
   large community of like-minded creative artists who love to share what
   they do. You are among the first to hear about the new and exciting
   products offered by Stampin’ Up!, including the new catalogs a month or
   more before they are released to the general public — PREORDER! OnStage
   events and making new friends. And so much more.

   What are you waiting for? I would love to help you sign up and have you
   as one of my team members. That would be an awesome way to celebrate my
   10 year Anniversary!

   Thank you for stopping by today. Until next time, stamp on my friends.

   Linda

Pressed Petals Greetings

   Posted on July 15, 2019 by Linda Tolson Yarbrough

   Greetings my stamping friends. I have been pinging around between
   projects and thought I’d take a moment and share with you two I finally
   finished!

   The new Annual Catalog that was released in June has an amazing
   selection of designer series paper to pick from and one of my favorites
   is the Pressed Petals Specialty:

   It looks like freshly pressed flowers and makes creating beautiful
   projects a snap. Here are two cards designs I made using this paper as
   my main design element.

   I just love how the flowers and leaves seem to pop out of the paper.
   Makes my creative process easy once I get up the nerve to cut it that
   is.

   Here are the Stampin’ Up! products that I used in the designs of these
   cards:

   If you have any questions regarding the design of these cards, do not
   hesitate to ask. I always share my project designs for FREE!

   I have several more projects to share with you if I can ever focus my
   energy on one thing at a time. It’s been hard to do that lately, but I
   will try.

   Thank you for stopping by today. I hope you leave here inspired to put
   stamps to ink to paper. Until next time, stamp on my friends.

New Paper Trimmer by Stampin’ Up!

   Posted on October 1, 2019 by Linda Tolson Yarbrough

   Papercrafting begins with a beautiful first cut, which means having the
   right tool for the job is kind of a big deal.  The Research &
   Development team at Stampin’ Up! has been hard at work designing a new
   paper trimmer and is now ready to reveal the fruits of their labor. I
   am excited to introduce to you the new Paper Trimmer by Stampin’ Up!

   This highly anticipated new tool is “a cut above the rest”. Here is a
   photo array from its unveiling photo shoot.

   Now THAT is one beautiful Paper Trimmer.

   How can you get one of these new beautiful tools for yourself, you ask?
   Starting today, October 1, a “demonstrator preorder” period begins
   which means for now this is only available for purchase if you are an
   active demonstrator. Good news is that if you sign up to become a
   demonstrator during the preorder period, you can ADD THE PAPER TRIMMER
   as one of the products in your STARTER KIT! If you have been wanting to
   join – here is your sign. Simply contact me for information on how you
   can join the fun and become a demonstrator.

   With all good things, there is an end date for this promotion – October
   31.

   Customer Availability: To ensure we have a sufficient inventory of
   Paper Trimmers for our customers, we will not announce a customer
   release date until we are able to gauge the new product’s inventory
   levels and popularity during the demonstrator preorder period. An
   update will be provided as soon as we have a customer release date.

   I hope you are as excited as I am about this new tool. Here is a short
   video that reflects just how excited.

Toile Tidings for Christmas

   Posted on September 26, 2019 by Linda Tolson Yarbrough

   Greetings my stamping friends! I actually have a project I made using
   new products from the Holiday Catalog – I know; I am as shocked as you
   are!

   I only purchased a few products during the preorder period for
   demonstrators (the month before the catalog goes live to customers) and
   I have been so busy trying to juggle all that I want to try to do that
   I haven’t accomplished much of anything,

   After spending some time a few weekends ago with Amy Storrie in Denton
   at her “Stampin’ Spot” I got some motivation and completed a project I
   had started that is a partial CASE from the Holiday Catalog (page 6).

   I made a few modifications but the layout was inspired by the design
   team of artists at Stampin’ Up! (Thank you!)

   Here are the Stampin’ Up! products that I used in the design of this
   card which can be added to your shopping cart with a quick click on the

   NOTE: For the leaves on the branch with the berries, I used the Garden
   Green pencil from the Watercolor Pencils Assortment 2 collection. I did
   not blend or add any water as I did not want the Memento ink to bleed.

   If you have any other questions regarding the measurements or design
   elements of this card, do not hesitate to ask. I share my card designs
   for FREE.

   Thank you for stopping by today. I hope you leave here inspired to put
   stamps to ink to paper. Until next time, stamp on my friends.

Winter Wonders by Paper Pumpkin

   Posted on September 12, 2019 by Linda Tolson Yarbrough

   Greetings my stamping friends.

   Let’s face it. The holiday season will be here before we know it. And
   along with putting up the Christmas tree and spending cold nights by
   the fire, we have gifts to wrap and greeting cards to send out to
   friends and family near and far.

   Stampin’ Up! to the rescue with their next two Paper Pumpkin kits for
   October and November! Winter Wonders will be coordinating kits, but
   each kit is all-inclusive and can stand alone. Here is more information
   about each kit:

   October Kit
     * Makes 10 cards and envelopes
     * Card size: 4 1/4″ x 5-1/2″ (10.8 x 14 cm)
     * Envelope size: 4-1/2″ x 5-3/4″ (11.4 x 14.6 cm)
     * Coordinating colors: Early Espresso, Pool Party, Poppy Parade, and
       Shaded Spruce

   November Kit
     * Makes 24 holiday-themed gift tags of 4 various sizes and designs.
     * Coordinating colors: Early Espresso, Pool Party, Real Red, and
       Shaded Spruce

   Both kits make it easy for you to add a handmade, personal touch to
   your holiday giving—without a lot of fuss. It’s Christmas made easy
   with Paper Pumpkin!

   Whether you are an avid crafter or a beginner, Paper Pumpkin is the
   perfect box of fun and even makes the perfect gift for a friend or that
   crafty person on your holiday list. You can order more than one of each
   kit if you need more cards or tags, or add coordinating products from
   the Annual or Holiday Catalogs to “stretch” your kit’s potential. There
   are always extra bits remaining from each kit so with some extra card
   stock and envelopes the sky is the limit.

   If you have any questions on how a subscription to Paper Pumpkin works,
   please ask me. If you wish to renew or start a new subscription here is
   the link to my page: PaperPumpkin

   To receive the October kit you need to be a subscriber by October 10.
   To receive the November kit you need to be a subscriber by November 10.
   A monthly subscription in the U.S. costs $22.00 + tax (shipping
   included) per kit.

   And to show you just how much fun a Paper Pumpkin box can be, here is a
   new video:

Wood-Mount Stamp Set Destash

   Posted on August 15, 2019 by Linda Tolson Yarbrough

   Greetings my stamping friends. I hope you are all staying cool as the
   Summer season blasts its last rays of heat upon you all. We have been
   fortunate here in my part of Texas so far this year, but I am sure we
   will get at least one “heat wave” before we move into our so-called
   Fall season.

   I have been neglecting my blog and relying on Facebook and Instagram to
   communicate lately so I thought I would send you all a quick post to
   let you know that I have begun posting retired wood-mount stamp sets on
   eBay. There are some REALLY old sets (as far back as 1995) out there if
   you are looking for something different and love the stamps that come
   attached to the wood blocks.

   I started two days ago and am continuing to add items. The listings are
   5-day auctions so most have at least 3 days remaining. You can reach my
   eBay store (lrtolson) HERE.

   I will continue to destash so check back to my eBay stored often so you
   don’t miss your chance for a bargain!

   Thank you for stopping by. Until next time, stamp on my friends.

August Paper Pumpkin Sneak Peek

   Posted on July 18, 2019 by Linda Tolson Yarbrough

   Are you done with the heat of Summer? I know I am and we really haven’t
   hit the triple digit heat we typically have here in the heart of Texas,
   but with the amount of rain we have had so far this year the humidity
   it off the charts!

   With the August Paper Pumpkin Kit Stampin’ Up! is opening the door to
   the coziness of fall with a project of gift bags and tags featuring the
   rich colors of fall leaves. But wait a minute if you are disappointed
   that this is not a card kit – because for the first time ever (I think
   I have been saying that a lot this year – they are really going above
   and beyond this year!) – there will be an add-on bundle option
   available on August 1 while supplies last.

   This bundle will include 24 card bases (12 each of two designs) with
   coordinating envelopes for $10.00! This add-on bundle will not
   automatically ship to all Paper Pumpkin subscribers who receive the
   August kit. If you want the card bases add-on bundle you must place a
   separate order either through your demonstrator or stampinup.com.

   Now that is an amazing kit and add-on bundle! I hope I remember to
   place my order for the add-on before they sell out!

   If you are not already a Paper Pumpkin subscriber, you can subscribe
   monthly HERE, or purchase 1, 3, 6 or 12-month pre-paid subscriptions.
   These kits also make great gifts for the crafter in your life who is
   hard to shop for.
   Product List
   1-Month Prepaid Paper Pumpkin Subscription
   1-Month Prepaid Paper Pumpkin Subscription
   [137858]
   $21.00
   3-Month Prepaid Paper Pumpkin Subscription

   $63.00
   6-Month Prepaid Paper Pumpkin Subscription

   $114.00
   One year Prepaid Paper Pumpkin Subscription

   If you have any questions about becoming a subscriber or how to get the
   add-on bundle for the August kit, do not hesitate to contact me. The
   last day to subscribe for the August kit is August 10, 2019.

   Thank you for stopping by today. Until next time, stamp on my friends.

Celebrating 10 Years with Stampin’ Up!

   Posted on July 17, 2019 by Linda Tolson Yarbrough

   Greetings my stamping friends! July 16th marked my 10 year Anniversary
   as a Stampin’ Up! demonstrator! Woohoo!!!

   Help me celebrate my Anniversary!

   As a token of my appreciation to my customers, if you place a minimum
   $50.00 order through my demonstrator website now through the end of
   July 2019, you will receive a FREE gift from me consisting of five (5)
   hand-made cards of random designs PLUS your choice of Faceted Gems in
   either Clear or Gold (see page 178 of the Annual Catalog). These FREE
   gifts will be shipped to you from me in August.

   HOST CODE: MXE6VNYA

   I have created a Work Shop Host Code as reflected above for you to use
   so that I, as the hostess, can receive the accumulative hostess
   benefits for orders that are less than $150.00. If your order is
   $150.00 or more, do not use the host code, you will want the hostess
   benefits for yourself!

   Bonus Days!

   And don’t forget that you earn a $5.00 coupon that you can use in
   August for every $50.00 you spend in July (before taxes and shipping)
   in July!

   From now until August 31, new demonstrators will receive an additional
   $30 US to put toward bonus products in their Starter Kit. THEN, they’ll
   receive a $10 US coupon code the following month.

   So what does this mean to you? A Starter Kit is $99.00 in the US. For
   that fee, you now select $155.00 worth of Stampin’ Up! products. Plus,
   the following month you will have a $10.00 US coupon to use towards
   anything else you wish to purchase. The best thing about the Starter
   Kit is that it is 100% customizable by YOU. You are not required to
   purchase anything that you do not want or need. Of course, if you are
   not sure what you would need, we have a recommended supply list ready
   for you to use as a reference.

   What are the benefits of becoming a Stampin’ Up! demonstrator? You
   immediately begin receiving a 20-25% discount or commission (depending
   on your title) on all purchases or customer sales. You have access to a
   large community of like-minded creative artists who love to share what
   they do. You are among the first to hear about the new and exciting
   products offered by Stampin’ Up!, including the new catalogs a month or
   more before they are released to the general public — PREORDER! OnStage
   events and making new friends. And so much more.

   What are you waiting for? I would love to help you sign up and have you
   as one of my team members. That would be an awesome way to celebrate my
   10 year Anniversary!

   Thank you for stopping by today. Until next time, stamp on my friends.

Pressed Petals Greetings

   Posted on July 15, 2019 by Linda Tolson Yarbrough

   Greetings my stamping friends. I have been pinging around between
   projects and thought I’d take a moment and share with you two I finally
   finished!

   The new Annual Catalog that was released in June has an amazing
   selection of designer series paper to pick from and one of my favorites
   is the Pressed Petals Specialty:

   It looks like freshly pressed flowers and makes creating beautiful
   projects a snap. Here are two cards designs I made using this paper as
   my main design element.

   I just love how the flowers and leaves seem to pop out of the paper.
   Makes my creative process easy once I get up the nerve to cut it that
   is.

   Here are the Stampin’ Up! products that I used in the designs of these
   cards:

   If you have any questions regarding the design of these cards, do not
   hesitate to ask. I always share my project designs for FREE!

   I have several more projects to share with you if I can ever focus my
   energy on one thing at a time. It’s been hard to do that lately, but I
   will try.

   Thank you for stopping by today. I hope you leave here inspired to put
   stamps to ink to paper. Until next time, stamp on my friends.

New Paper Trimmer by Stampin’ Up!

   Posted on October 1, 2019 by Linda Tolson Yarbrough

   Papercrafting begins with a beautiful first cut, which means having the
   right tool for the job is kind of a big deal.  The Research &
   Development team at Stampin’ Up! has been hard at work designing a new
   paper trimmer and is now ready to reveal the fruits of their labor. I
   am excited to introduce to you the new Paper Trimmer by Stampin’ Up!

   This highly anticipated new tool is “a cut above the rest”. Here is a
   photo array from its unveiling photo shoot.

   Now THAT is one beautiful Paper Trimmer.

   How can you get one of these new beautiful tools for yourself, you ask?
   Starting today, October 1, a “demonstrator preorder” period begins
   which means for now this is only available for purchase if you are an
   active demonstrator. Good news is that if you sign up to become a
   demonstrator during the preorder period, you can ADD THE PAPER TRIMMER
   as one of the products in your STARTER KIT! If you have been wanting to
   join – here is your sign. Simply contact me for information on how you
   can join the fun and become a demonstrator.

   With all good things, there is an end date for this promotion – October
   31.

   Customer Availability: To ensure we have a sufficient inventory of
   Paper Trimmers for our customers, we will not announce a customer
   release date until we are able to gauge the new product’s inventory
   levels and popularity during the demonstrator preorder period. An
   update will be provided as soon as we have a customer release date.

   I hope you are as excited as I am about this new tool. Here is a short
   video that reflects just how excited.

Toile Tidings for Christmas

   Posted on September 26, 2019 by Linda Tolson Yarbrough

   Greetings my stamping friends! I actually have a project I made using
   new products from the Holiday Catalog – I know; I am as shocked as you
   are!

   I only purchased a few products during the preorder period for
   demonstrators (the month before the catalog goes live to customers) and
   I have been so busy trying to juggle all that I want to try to do that
   I haven’t accomplished much of anything,

   After spending some time a few weekends ago with Amy Storrie in Denton
   at her “Stampin’ Spot” I got some motivation and completed a project I
   had started that is a partial CASE from the Holiday Catalog (page 6).

   I made a few modifications but the layout was inspired by the design
   team of artists at Stampin’ Up! (Thank you!)

   Here are the Stampin’ Up! products that I used in the design of this
   card which can be added to your shopping cart with a quick click on the
   thumbnails below:

   NOTE: For the leaves on the branch with the berries, I used the Garden
   Green pencil from the Watercolor Pencils Assortment 2 collection. I did
   not blend or add any water as I did not want the Memento ink to bleed.

   If you have any other questions regarding the measurements or design
   elements of this card, do not hesitate to ask. I share my card designs
   for FREE.

   Thank you for stopping by today. I hope you leave here inspired to put
   stamps to ink to paper. Until next time, stamp on my friends.

   Linda

   P.S. If you want or need help creating your Christmas Cards for this
   year, consider getting some friends together for a Christmas
   “Stamp-a-Stack”. I can organize it for you. Contact me for more

Winter Wonders by Paper Pumpkin

   Posted on September 12, 2019 by Linda Tolson Yarbrough

   Greetings my stamping friends.

   Let’s face it. The holiday season will be here before we know it. And
   along with putting up the Christmas tree and spending cold nights by
   the fire, we have gifts to wrap and greeting cards to send out to
   friends and family near and far.

   Stampin’ Up! to the rescue with their next two Paper Pumpkin kits for
   October and November! Winter Wonders will be coordinating kits, but
   each kit is all-inclusive and can stand alone. Here is more information
   about each kit:

   October Kit
     * Makes 10 cards and envelopes
     * Card size: 4 1/4″ x 5-1/2″ (10.8 x 14 cm)
     * Envelope size: 4-1/2″ x 5-3/4″ (11.4 x 14.6 cm)
     * Coordinating colors: Early Espresso, Pool Party, Poppy Parade, and
       Shaded Spruce

   November Kit
     * Makes 24 holiday-themed gift tags of 4 various sizes and designs.
     * Coordinating colors: Early Espresso, Pool Party, Real Red, and
       Shaded Spruce

   Both kits make it easy for you to add a handmade, personal touch to
   your holiday giving—without a lot of fuss. It’s Christmas made easy
   with Paper Pumpkin!

   Whether you are an avid crafter or a beginner, Paper Pumpkin is the
   perfect box of fun and even makes the perfect gift for a friend or that
   crafty person on your holiday list. You can order more than one of each
   kit if you need more cards or tags, or add coordinating products from
   the Annual or Holiday Catalogs to “stretch” your kit’s potential. There
   are always extra bits remaining from each kit so with some extra card
   stock and envelopes the sky is the limit.

   If you have any questions on how a subscription to Paper Pumpkin works,
   please ask me. If you wish to renew or start a new subscription here is
   the link to my page: PaperPumpkin

   To receive the October kit you need to be a subscriber by October 10.
   To receive the November kit you need to be a subscriber by November 10.
   A monthly subscription in the U.S. costs $22.00 + tax (shipping
   included) per kit.

   And to show you just how much fun a Paper Pumpkin box can be, here is a
   new video:

Wood-Mount Stamp Set Destash

   Posted on August 15, 2019 by Linda Tolson Yarbrough

   Greetings my stamping friends. I hope you are all staying cool as the
   Summer season blasts its last rays of heat upon you all. We have been
   fortunate here in my part of Texas so far this year, but I am sure we
   will get at least one “heat wave” before we move into our so-called
   Fall season.

   I have been neglecting my blog and relying on Facebook and Instagram to
   communicate lately so I thought I would send you all a quick post to
   let you know that I have begun posting retired wood-mount stamp sets on
   eBay. There are some REALLY old sets (as far back as 1995) out there if
   you are looking for something different and love the stamps that come
   attached to the wood blocks.

   I started two days ago and am continuing to add items. The listings are
   5-day auctions so most have at least 3 days remaining. You can reach my
   eBay store (lrtolson) HERE.

   I will continue to destash so check back to my eBay stored often so you
   don’t miss your chance for a bargain!

   Thank you for stopping by. Until next time, stamp on my friends.

August Paper Pumpkin Sneak Peek

   Posted on July 18, 2019 by Linda Tolson Yarbrough

   Are you done with the heat of Summer? I know I am and we really haven’t
   hit the triple digit heat we typically have here in the heart of Texas,
   but with the amount of rain we have had so far this year the humidity
   it off the charts!

   With the August Paper Pumpkin Kit Stampin’ Up! is opening the door to
   the coziness of fall with a project of gift bags and tags featuring the
   rich colors of fall leaves. But wait a minute if you are disappointed
   that this is not a card kit – because for the first time ever (I think
   I have been saying that a lot this year – they are really going above
   and beyond this year!) – there will be an add-on bundle option
   available on August 1 while supplies last.

   This bundle will include 24 card bases (12 each of two designs) with
   coordinating envelopes for $10.00! This add-on bundle will not
   automatically ship to all Paper Pumpkin subscribers who receive the
   August kit. If you want the card bases add-on bundle you must place a
   separate order either through your demonstrator or stampinup.com.

   Now that is an amazing kit and add-on bundle! I hope I remember to
   place my order for the add-on before they sell out!

   If you are not already a Paper Pumpkin subscriber, you can subscribe
   monthly HERE, or purchase 1, 3, 6 or 12-month pre-paid subscriptions.
   These kits also make great gifts for the crafter in your life who is
   hard to shop for.
   Product List
   1-Month Prepaid Paper Pumpkin Subscription
   1-Month Prepaid Paper Pumpkin Subscription
   [137858]
   $21.00
   3-Month Prepaid Paper Pumpkin Subscription
   3-Month Prepaid Paper Pumpkin Subscription
   [137859]
   $63.00
   6-Month Prepaid Paper Pumpkin Subscription
   6-Month Prepaid Paper Pumpkin Subscription
   [137860]
   $114.00
   One year Prepaid Paper Pumpkin Subscription
   One year Prepaid Paper Pumpkin Subscription
   [137861]
   $220.00

   If you have any questions about becoming a subscriber or how to get the
   add-on bundle for the August kit, do not hesitate to contact me. The
   last day to subscribe for the August kit is August 10, 2019.

   Thank you for stopping by today. Until next time, stamp on my friends.

Celebrating 10 Years with Stampin’ Up!

   Posted on July 17, 2019 by Linda Tolson Yarbrough

   Greetings my stamping friends! July 16th marked my 10 year Anniversary
   as a Stampin’ Up! demonstrator! Woohoo!!!

   Help me celebrate my Anniversary!

   As a token of my appreciation to my customers, if you place a minimum
   $50.00 order through my demonstrator website now through the end of
   July 2019, you will receive a FREE gift from me consisting of five (5)
   hand-made cards of random designs PLUS your choice of Faceted Gems in
   either Clear or Gold (see page 178 of the Annual Catalog). These FREE
   gifts will be shipped to you from me in August.

   HOST CODE: MXE6VNYA

   I have created a Work Shop Host Code as reflected above for you to use
   so that I, as the hostess, can receive the accumulative hostess
   benefits for orders that are less than $150.00. If your order is
   $150.00 or more, do not use the host code, you will want the hostess
   benefits for yourself!

   Bonus Days!

   And don’t forget that you earn a $5.00 coupon that you can use in
   August for every $50.00 you spend in July (before taxes and shipping)
   in July!

   From now until August 31, new demonstrators will receive an additional
   $30 US to put toward bonus products in their Starter Kit. THEN, they’ll
   receive a $10 US coupon code the following month.

   So what does this mean to you? A Starter Kit is $99.00 in the US. For
   that fee, you now select $155.00 worth of Stampin’ Up! products. Plus,
   the following month you will have a $10.00 US coupon to use towards
   anything else you wish to purchase. The best thing about the Starter
   Kit is that it is 100% customizable by YOU. You are not required to
   purchase anything that you do not want or need. Of course, if you are
   not sure what you would need, we have a recommended supply list ready
   for you to use as a reference.

   What are the benefits of becoming a Stampin’ Up! demonstrator? You
   immediately begin receiving a 20-25% discount or commission (depending
   on your title) on all purchases or customer sales. You have access to a
   large community of like-minded creative artists who love to share what
   they do. You are among the first to hear about the new and exciting
   products offered by Stampin’ Up!, including the new catalogs a month or

Pressed Petals Greetings

   Posted on July 15, 2019 by Linda Tolson Yarbrough

   Greetings my stamping friends. I have been pinging around between
   projects and thought I’d take a moment and share with you two I finally
   finished!

   The new Annual Catalog that was released in June has an amazing
   selection of designer series paper to pick from and one of my favorites
   is the Pressed Petals Specialty:

   It looks like freshly pressed flowers and makes creating beautiful
   projects a snap. Here are two cards designs I made using this paper as
   my main design element.

   I just love how the flowers and leaves seem to pop out of the paper.
   Makes my creative process easy once I get up the nerve to cut it that
   is.

   Here are the Stampin’ Up! products that I used in the designs of these
   cards:

   hesitate to ask. I always share my project designs for FREE!

   I have several more projects to share with you if I can ever focus my
   energy on one thing at a time. It’s been hard to do that lately, but I
   will try.

   Thank you for stopping by today. I hope you leave here inspired to put
   stamps to ink to paper. Until next time, stamp on my friends.

   Linda
