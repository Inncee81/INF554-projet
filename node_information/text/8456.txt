Unsafe and undignified – the plight of sanitation workers

World Toilet Day
       Countless sanitation workers in the developing world work in
       conditions that endanger their lives and health, and violate their
       dignity and rights. To mark World Toilet Day, the ILO, World Bank,
       World Health Organization and Water Aid issued a report
       highlighting the unsafe and undignified working conditions of
       sanitation workers around the world. See some of their stories
       here.

100 years of maternity protection
       100 years ago, the ILO adopted the first-ever international
       standard on maternity protection. Since that Convention, the
       definition of maternity protection has expanded and its importance
       has become more widely appreciated – including as an essential
       element in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals of good
       health, gender equality, decent work and economic growth. But,
       despite this progress, many mothers and mothers-to-be still face
       serious challenges in the workplace.
          + Has your country ratified Maternity Protection Convention,
            2000 (No. 183)? Find out here.
