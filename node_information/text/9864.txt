   Domain Name System
   Internationalized Domain Name ,IDN,"IDNs are domain names that include
   characters used in the local representation of languages that are not
   written with the twenty-six letters of the basic Latin alphabet
   ""a-z"". An IDN can contain Latin letters with diacritical marks, as
   required by many European languages, or may consist of characters from
   non-Latin scripts such as Arabic or Chinese. Many languages also use
   other types of digits than the European ""0-9"". The basic Latin
   alphabet together with the European-Arabic digits are, for the purpose
   of domain names, termed ""ASCII characters"" (ASCII = American Standard
   Code for Information Interchange). These are also included in the
   broader range of ""Unicode characters"" that provides the basis for
   IDNs. The ""hostname rule"" requires that all domain names of the type
   under consideration here are stored in the DNS using only the ASCII
   characters listed above, with the one further addition of the hyphen
   ""-"". The Unicode form of an IDN therefore requires special encoding
   before it is entered into the DNS. The following terminology is used
   when distinguishing between these forms: A domain name consists of a
   series of ""labels"" (separated by ""dots""). The ASCII form of an IDN
   label is termed an ""A-label"". All operations defined in the DNS
   protocol use A-labels exclusively. The Unicode form, which a user
   expects to be displayed, is termed a ""U-label"". The difference may be
   illustrated with the Hindi word for ""test"" — परीका — appearing here
   as a U-label would (in the Devanagari script). A special form of
   ""ASCII compatible encoding"" (abbreviated ACE) is applied to this to
   produce the corresponding A-label: xn--11b5bs1di. A domain name that
   only includes ASCII letters, digits, and hyphens is termed an ""LDH
   label"". Although the definitions of A-labels and LDH-labels overlap, a
   name consisting exclusively of LDH labels, such as""icann.org"" is not
   an IDN."
