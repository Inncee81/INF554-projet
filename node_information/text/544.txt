Here's Even More Audio of Shane Gillis From ‘Saturday Night Live’ Gleefully
Saying Slurs

While the YouTube video has since been made private, the audio footage from
the May 2019 recording of 'Real Ass Podcast' remains online.

   Newly anointed Saturday Night Live cast member Shane Gillis called
   Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang a "Jew c---k" in a
   podcast episode recorded in May of this year. The episode of Real Ass
   Podcast, hosted by comedians Luis J. Gomez and Zac Amico, was
   previously accessible in a YouTube video that has since been made
   private. The episode's audio, however, is still available online.

   illis-comedian-podcast-the-newest-hire-on-saturday-night-live?utm_sourc
   e=stylizedembed_vice.com&utm_campaign=wjwxxw&site=vice

   Gillis's hiring as one of SNL's new featured players was announced on
   Thursday. He came under fire within hours over racist and homophobic
   slurs in episodes of his own podcast, co-hosted with Matt McCusker,
   recorded last year. He released a statement that night describing
   himself as "a comedian who pushes boundaries" but sometimes misses.
   "I'm happy to apologize to anyone who's actually offended by anything
   I've said," Gillis wrote. "My intention is never to hurt anyone but I
   am trying to be the best comedian I can be and sometimes that requires
   risks."

   Gillis took several of those "risks" in the Real Ass Podcast episode,
   number 402, recorded on Memorial Day 2019. The reference to Yang
   revolves around a callback to a moment earlier in the episode, around
   46 minutes and 30 seconds in. In that segment, Gomez riffs about a
   candy he describes as a small wax bottle containing an unsatisfying
   amount of sweet liquid (he appears to be describing the Nik-L-Lip).
   "What a fuckin' scam that was," he says. He starts to say, "whoever
   came up with that is the—" when Gillis jumps in and says "c----s." The
   entire group—Gomez, Amico, Gillis, and comic Mike Figs—appears to erupt
   in laughter, and one of the comics sings "ch-ch-ch-chi-ch-c----s" over
   a drum sting. "Shane Gillis crushing it with a one-word racist
   punchline," Gomez says. "One of my favorites."

   Gillis's subsequent use of the slur occurs around one hour and six
   minutes into the episode. The comics are riffing about Bernie Sanders,
   whom Gillis describes as Mario to Dick Cheney's Wario. The riff
   descends into awkwardness, and Gillis says his Wario joke was the best
   joke of the episode. Gomez responds, "your c---k line was 40 times
   better." Some cross-talk ensues in which Gillis remarks on his frequent
   use of that slur, before directing it to Sanders: "That Jew c---k?
   Commie Jew c---k? Next, please, next. Gimme your next candidate, Dems.
   Jew c---k, next. Actually, they are running a Jew c---k—Chang, dude."
   Then the conversation turns to author and life coach Tony Robbins.

   These were not the only instances of hateful language directed toward
   Asian people in the episode. About an hour in, the group prepares for a
   segment in which they watch a random podcast; in this case, their
   producer has chosen the video podcast "Make Money Travel Blogging
   Featuring Jacob Fu." Upon learning the name, the group, led by Gillis,
   breaks out into exaggerated Chinese accents. When the video starts
   playing, Gillis exclaims, "I was making fun of these guys for being
   Asian—they're so hot. Look at these hot guys, dude… he speaks so much
   better than all of us." He chides one of his fellow comics to stop
   speaking in a mocking accent. "Now it's very racist. These guys speak
   great, they're handsome… Those are nice handsome boys having fun."

   Then Gillis appears to start describing the group. "Fat ugly idiots
   promoting hate, that's what this is," he says. "That's what this is?"
   Gomez responds. "Yeah, look at all of us," Gillis says. "We're all
   shitty people. At least those Asians were having fun."

   VICE has reached out to Gillis and NBC for comment.

A Guide to VH1's Drunk, Loud, Unapologetic Golden Age of Reality TV

'Flavor of 'Rock of Love,' 'Flavor of Love,' 'I Love New York,' and others
are on Prime, so it's time to revisit Somethin's staircase poop.

   Credit: VH1

   Amazon did a great service recently when they made almost the entire
   catalog of VH1's mid- to late-00s reality TV series available to stream
   on Prime. Spanning roughly from 2006 to 2010, a time period which
   yielded such glorious shows as Flavor of Love, Rock of Love, and I Love
   New York, this is, undoubtedly, an opportunity to re-immerse oneself in
   the golden era of trash television. Without these now-classic shows,
   the world would never know Tiffany "New York" Pollard, the most GIFable
   queen of the entire internet. It would never learn that "people who eat
   basil are lame," or that "stripper shoes go with any outfit," among
   other gems of wisdom from Rock of Love Bus's glorious (and often
   wasted) cast member Ashley Klarich. Truly, this earth would have been
   worse off had it never been privy to Tykeisha "Somethin" Thomas from
   Flavor of Love season 2 infamously defecating on the staircase after a
   clock ceremony (more on this later), or Nikki taking a test-tube shot
   out of Gia's vagina on Rock of Love. These contestants and their
   hijinks were far from the Hannahs and Laurens of The Bachelor universe,
   unafraid to let their freak flags wave, get laid, get drunk, be loud,
   and drag each other ruthlessly.

   While there's now an entire universe of 90 Day Fiancé and more than
   half a dozen Real Housewives franchises fulfilling our raccoon-like
   need to devour absolute garbage, VH1's staple lineup of 00s reality TV
   just hit differently. These shows were unhinged in strange and
   hilarious ways, and remain endlessly quotable, memeable, and, now,
   nostalgic for reality TV fans. These characters' willingness to go to
   astronomical levels of absurdity and all-out, televised chaos for the
   object of their (heavily staged) affection remains mesmerizing,
   undoubtedly egged on by producers and accentuated by editors' additions
   of tongue-in-cheek sound and visual effects (like Flavor of Love's
   Hottie getting a bike chime noise every time she blinked her big, false
   lashes at someone).

   Now, years after their sell-by date, we can joyously revisit these
   wonderfully subversive pieces of reality TV perfection. Here's a
   helpful guide to VH1's greatest shows, all of which embody the wildness
   of an abandoned amusement park run by feral badgers.

If it's rap legends, boss bitches, and bodily fluids you crave, get a taste
of Flavor of Love.

   After his breakup with 80s actress Brigitte Nielsen (their relationship
   was documented in the aptly titled series Strange Love, a spin-off of
   The Surreal Life), VH1 producers gave Public Enemy's Flavor Flav the
   chance to find The One on Flavor of Love, a dating series that parodied
   The Bachelor. Unlike The Bachelor, however, the series featured a
   racially diverse cast of women vying for one of Flav's trademark clocks
   to wear around their necks, signifying that they would advance to the
   next round. While many Black writers called out the show for being
   exploitative and perpetuating offensive stereotypes, the series was a
   ratings beast that lasted three seasons and led to multiple spinoffs,
   and the women that stepped into Flav's mansion became some of the
   greatest contestants in reality TV history thanks to their
   unapologetic, unadulterated personalities. They kept it real at all
   times, leading to scenes and lines that are still fondly memorialized
   on the internet to this day. There was Hottie's assurance that everyone
   says she reminds them of Beyoncé; Pumkin launching a spit missile at
   New York; the aforementioned poop on the staircase incident (Somethin
   explained that she tried to hold it, but her stomach said, "Bitch,
   you've got me fucked up;" Flav then applauded Somethin for being "real
   with it"); and too many moments from Tiffany "New York" Pollard to
   count. For two seasons, New York ran the other women ragged,
   implementing grade-A trash talk, stare-downs, and fearlessness in
   pursuit of her man Flav. Her iconic level of drama rendered her worthy
   of various spin-offs, a Brooklyn art show of works created in her
   honor, and a throne as the reigning as the queen of reaction GIFs.
   Every minute of television where the camera is on New York is worth the
   watch.

   Watch on: Seasons 1 and 3 on Amazon Prime, Seasons 1 and 2 on Hulu

If you stan stripper heels, giant breast implants, and hair teased to the
heavens, look no further than Rock of Love.

   yle-from-bret-michaelss-girls-on-bars?utm_source=stylizedembed_vice.com
   &utm_campaign=ywa5ey&site=vice

   For three seasons, Bret Michaels—best known as the lead singer of
   hair-metal band Poison and the co-star of Pamela Anderson's
   lesser-known sex tape—searched America (and whatever part of France the
   extremely horny Angelique is from) to find his tour bus partner for
   life. The incessantly sloppy-drunk contestants came in hot, armed with
   an arsenal of clear heels, ass-cheek-grazing polyester dresses, and an
   insatiable desire to make out with Bret Michaels. But they were more
   than Sunset Strip groupies, strippers, and porn stars; they were women
   on a mission to get their man (and some screen time). There were
   standouts from all three seasons, like the big-haired, 80s metal
   goddess Heather, who got Michaels's name tattooed on her neck; the
   cackling, painfully earnest cowgirl Rodeo; and mean girl Ashley, whose
   magnificent implants and the way she said "bitch" made her extra
   larger-than-life. But those women were just a few in a kaleidoscope of
   big personalities, including one contestant who took everyone's used
   socks after a hockey match to keep for her personal use. In the end,
   Bret never found his true match, but the search yielded hours of
   premium entertainment.

   Watch on: Amazon Prime and Hulu

You love Tiffany Pollard? Then you'll definitely love I Love New York.

   After two unsuccessful efforts to win Flav's final clock, Pollard
   landed a spin-off dating show of her own. For two seasons, Pollard and
   her frighteningly brutal mom, Sister Patterson, put a group of studs
   and duds through the absolute ringer as they pledged their undying love
   for New York. Within that group were some standouts that made for
   excellent television, like excruciatingly dweeby white boy Mr. Boston,
   mouthy "stallionaire" Chance, his more tender brother Real (who
   tragically died of colon cancer in 2015), outspoken little person
   Midget Mac, Italian mama's boy Frank the Entertainer, and countless
   others. There was toe sucking, speedo wearing, a pretty bad nosebleed,
   and a fervent church service led by Sister Patterson. It was worth
   watching for Pollard's electrifying presence alone, but became a true
   carnival thanks to the full cast and their antics.

   Watch on: Hulu

If dudes who look like Criss Angel get you going, pick Daisy of Love.

   Rock of Love season 2 runner-up Daisy de la Hoya (yes, she is related
   to boxer Oscar de la Hoya) didn't leave with the man of her rock 'n'
   roll dreams. But the heavily lip-plumped rock chick did score her own
   one-season spin-off in which 20 dudes that look like they ransacked
   Dave Navarro's closet fought for her affection. The show also featured
   a set of glammed-out triplets who claimed to be Swedish rock stars in a
   band called Snake of Eden and enjoyed eating raw hot dogs out of the
   package. It's a leather-cuff and nautical-star tornado in there, and
   it's gold.

   Watch on: Amazon Prime and Hulu

If it's a group of lingerie-clad women flipping off outdated ideas of
respectability you like, go with Charm School.

   Charm School sought to do the impossible: reform the hard-partying and
   harder-fighting women from Flavor of Love and Rock of Love, and turn
   them into polite, well-behaved ladies. It did so in grossly outdated
   ways, like telling the women to dress and behave less sexually. But the
   ladies fought back in every possible way, finding it hard to leave
   their boozing, trash-talking, and wearing-lingerie-as-outerwear ways
   behind them. (Bless them for that.) Hosted by Mo'Nique, Sharon
   Osbourne, and Ricki Lake in seasons 1, 2, and 3, respectively, the show
   saw contestants forced to perform challenges aimed at molding them into
   business-savvy, self-sufficient women, and in some cases, contestants
   seemed to actually care about evolving into better versions of
   themselves. But many others weren't even trying, and the show will be
   forever remembered as the one where Osbourne beat up aspiring trophy
   wife Megan Hauserman after she insulted Ozzy Osbourne during the season
   2 reunion. Not the most charming moment.

That Iconic Pic of Phoebe Waller-Bridge Smoking Was Almost Blocked by Amazon

"Smoking is always off-limits," a source reportedly said.

   The 2019 Emmys were mostly a wonky mess full of awkward TikTok jokes
   and terrifying Meryl Streep masks, but at least one genuinely good
   thing came out of it: that truly blessed image of Fleabag's Phoebe
   Waller-Bridge chilling so hard after winning a zillion much-deserved
   Emmys. The world collectively lost its mind when BBC comedy head Josh
   Cole tweeted it out last week, and since then, it has circulated
   nonstop with a million different captions about its aspirational
   qualities. But regardless, let's just take a minute and soak it in once
   again, because the sheer awesome power of the image has yet to lose its
   luster:

   It is a vibe worthy of at least an Emmy nomination on its own, but
   according to Hollywood Reporter, we almost didn't get to see it at
   all—because, apparently, Amazon doesn't approve of its stars smoking.

   Sources told the THR that Amazon was on-hand during that fateful
   Chateau Marmont afterparty, and already successfully foiled a few
   photographers from taking pictures of Waller-Bridge as she celebrated
   her post-Emmys win by ripping a cig. Luckily, the Amazon folks weren't
   fast enough to stop Cole from shooting his shot, but THR's source
   imagines the studio isn't exactly happy about it.

   com&utm_campaign=8xwvex&site=vice

   "I'm sure people are upset that [Cole's] photo made it out," the source
   said, according to Hollywood Reporter. "Smoking is always off-limits.
   But she was having fun and acting carefree."

   If by "having fun and acting carefree" the source meant "elegantly
   basking in the kind of meteoric success that the rest of us can only
   dream of," then, yes, that seems right. We common plebes are all lucky
   that Cole managed to evade the Amazon wet blankets and deliver us this
   sacred photo.

   Thank you for your service, Cole. The world needed to bare witness to
   such a blessed moment. We are forever grateful.

What Happened to 'Fresh Prince' Star Karyn Parsons?

The actress opens up to VICE about her very un-Hilary Banks-like life.

   What Ever Happened to...? is a biweekly investigation into the
   whereabouts of former icons. This installment dives deep into the life
   of Karyn Parsons, perhaps best known as Hilary Banks from the Fresh
   Prince of Bel-Air.

   If the 90s had a TV poster child for its shameless excess and unbridled
   confidence, her name would be Hilary Banks.
   Advertisement

   From 1990 to 1996, Karyn Parsons played The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air's
   eldest Banks sibling who, much like the shopping malls she so loved to
   frequent, lived squarely in a void of shallow consumerism. Hilary Banks
   was the Gordon Gekko of Rodeo Drive and represented an American Dream
   in which even a privileged, valley(-adjacent) girl with no common sense
   could stumble into a career as a national talk show host.

   But in the years after Fresh Prince ended, Parsons' name recognition
   faded in a world still decades away from salivating over every morsel
   of 90s nostalgia.

   "Not that I expected people to know who I was, but even when I'd try to
   tell casting directors what I'd done before, they would have no idea,"
   she tells VICE. "I started feeling really stupid trying to get them to
   know what Fresh Prince was and who I was on it. It was embarrassing.
   I'd feel like a moron, like, 'Oh, it was this show in the 90s.'"

   Now, this is a story all about how Karyn Parsons' post-sitcom life got
   flipped, turned upside down into one of advocacy, novels, and, yes,
   possibly reboots.

In Santa Monica, born and raised

   There were no "Dad, I need $300" moments in Parsons' childhood. While
   Parsons technically grew up less than eight miles from ritzy Bel-Air,
   her modest 1970s and 80s upbringing was a far cry from that of the
   Banks children. Rather than being waited on by a live-in British
   butler, Parsons spent most of her youth moving to various "little
   apartments" around then-"hippie-ish" Santa Monica with her mom, a
   deputy-sheriff-turned-bra-and-swimsuit-model-turned-librarian, while
   her father was "mostly absent."

   "We were lower middle class, borderline—we weren't poor. I never went
   without food or anything like that," she says. "But there was a period
   where my mom needed food stamps."

   Parsons identifies as biracial, the product of "a bizarre, odd couple"
   made up of "this really quirky-looking, Woody Allen-like guy" and "this
   amazing Tamara Dobson, Cleopatra Jones-looking, six-foot-tall Amazon
   woman." And she was one of the only "mixed kids" at her public school
   (Lenny Kravitz was another).

   "Even growing up with a white father and a Black mother, I didn't
   suffer a lot of feeling really uncomfortable about how different I was
   from others. I think that had a lot to do with the spirit of the time.
   It was a very Free to Be... You and Me upbringing. Not that I didn't
   experience racism, because of course I did—I was called the N-word—but
   it wasn't as overt as some other friends of mine experienced at that
   age."

   She focused her energy on becoming an actress, a dream that could have
   met an early end in ninth grade when she was dramatically banned from
   her high school theater program after one of her friends cheated off
   another's paper.

   "I was totally innocent! I wish I could brag and say that I was one of
   the troublemakers, but I was just one of the peanut gallery on the
   side," she says. "We were all banned from any production for the rest
   of our stay at the school. I look back now and I'm like, that shit
   would not fly with my daughter. I would be in there so fast with that
   theater arts teacher, like, 'Are you out of your mind?' But I don't
   think I told my mom. I don't think I breathed a word to her. I just
   kind of suffered this horrible fate and sucked it up."

   Her punishment may have been a blessing in disguise. Without a creative
   outlet at school, Parsons threw herself full force into a serious
   community acting workshop, where she studied Stanislavski and Hagen and
   spent any extra time she had on the audition circuit.

   Enter executive producer Quincy Jones and a pilot for a new
   fish-out-of-water sitcom centered on an affluent Black family. In 1990,
   with just three bit TV roles to her name—which, to be fair, was still
   more acting experience than Will Smith had at the time—Parsons nabbed
   the role of Hilary Banks.

The princess of Bel-Air

   We owe the existence of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air to Will Smith's tax
   problems. Nearly bankrupt and millions in debt to the IRS after his
   early musical success, Smith jumped at the chance for a steady,
   lucrative gig. For the first three seasons, 70 percent of his TV
   paychecks went straight to the government.

   While the NBC sitcom took time to find its ratings footing (by its
   third season, it was America's most popular show with an all-Black
   cast), its stars clicked instantly.

   "I suddenly had a sister [Tatyana Ali], I had a little brother [Alfonso
   Ribeiro], Will was like a brother," Parsons says. "Even the crew was
   like family. Everyone embraced each other and cared about each other.
   Even if it stopped right with the pilot, it would have still been a
   life-changing experience for me."

   Perhaps most crucially for Parsons was the arrival of a new father
   figure in the form of James Avery, the actor who played Uncle Phil. "He
   was so much like 'Dad.' He took that role very seriously on camera and
   off. My dad was not a typical dad, and James was," she says. "He was
   very affectionate and warm and always paid attention to who I was going
   out with, and if he saw them, he had to shake his finger in their face.
   He was great." (Avery died in 2013 at age 68 from complications
   following open heart surgery.)

   But in 1996, after six seasons and 148 episodes, NBC cancelled Fresh
   Prince and the close-knit cast went their separate ways. "It was
   devastating to suddenly be stripped away from them," says Parsons.
   "Everybody else went home to their families when it was over, and I
   pretty much went home to my two dogs and that was it."

More than one night at The Roxbury

   It took time for Parsons' new reality to set in. Virtually her entire
   adulthood had been spent cloaked in the comforting monotony of studio
   audience laughs and craft services lunches. Now, she found herself in a
   daze, and it took a run-in with her former junior-high friend Lenny
   Kravitz—whose mom had been a sitcom star on The Jeffersons—to shake her
   out of it.

   "I bumped into him not that long after Fresh Prince had been off, and
   he was the first person who looked at me and said, 'But how are you
   really doing?' Whether he meant it to laser in like that, it hit me,"
   she says. "It was the first time I really acknowledged that I wasn't
   doing that well. I was kind of tap dancing as fast as I could and not
   paying attention to the fact that it was a struggle."

   Meanwhile, substantial roles for women of color in the 90s were few and
   far between. During seasonal breaks on Fresh Prince, Parsons had
   managed to book films like Major Payne and Class Act but found it
   difficult to find decent projects even once freed of the hectic
   schedule of network TV.

   "There were a handful of actresses that were doing the work, and most
   of their names were Halle Berry," she laughs. "I was always like,
   'Halle got it again!' It seemed like there were so few roles and Halle
   was working like crazy, deservedly so."

   Parsons carved out her own opportunity in the form of a feminist sitcom
   called Lush Life that she co-created, produced, and starred in with pal
   Lori Petty. But the series premiered to dismal reviews (from mostly
   male critics) in September 1996, and after just four episodes aired,
   Fox pulled the plug.

   "It was a learning experience. Man, I learned so much doing that show,"
   Parsons says. "I've never worked so hard, but all of the new Fox
   comedies were taken off [when studio execs changed that year]. It
   didn't matter how well we had tested—because our show had tested really
   well—everything got yanked."

   Outside of work, Parsons and Petty became regulars at Hollywood's
   legendary Roxbury nightclub, known for its VIP clientele and celebrity
   drama.

   "I had a lot of fun times there, but there was also a lot of that
   chasing the dragon kind of thing," she says. "I remember it got to the
   point when Lori and I had worked out, and we'd show up at the Roxbury
   with our hair pulled up and no makeup in sweatpants and sneakers, and
   the bouncer would let us through, past everybody else, into the club.
   We had gotten so lazy about it. It was weird. All that shine was
   probably wearing off a little bit. You go expecting that same feeling,
   and then after a while, it's kind of like, why are we here?"

Starting over

   Advertisement

   Eager for a change of scenery, Parsons moved to New York and continued
   acting in films like Mixing Nia and The Ladies Man, as well as Denis
   Leary's short-lived 2001 detective comedy The Job. Her cross-country
   move also led her to her now-husband, filmmaker Alexandre Rockwell,
   whom she met at a mutual friend's restaurant opening. They married in
   2003, and welcomed a daughter named Lana that same year. Their son,
   Nico, followed in 2007.

   "My interests were changing," she says. "It became very difficult to do
   everything, to memorize lines for a part and have to get someone to
   last-minute watch the kids—to race across town and do all that, and if
   you got a call back, do it again. I'd find myself dropping the ball a
   lot."

   Parsons began focusing on writing, and in 2005 founded the non-profit
   organization Sweet Blackberry, aimed at educating children about
   little-known parts of African American history. The idea had been
   simmering for years, ever since her librarian mom had first brought
   stories like that of Henry "Box" Brown—a slave who literally mailed
   himself to freedom—to her attention.

   "When I was pregnant with my daughter, that's when I started really
   thinking about what are they going to teach her in school, and what am
   I supposed to teach her? How do I supplement her education as a
   parent?" Parsons says. "As I was talking a lot about Black history and
   stories that you don't hear about, my husband was like, you need to do
   this."

   Fourteen years later, Sweet Blackberry has grown from a passion project
   into a thriving organization with a series of animated short films
   available on DVD and Netflix narrated by the likes of Alfre Woodard,
   Chris Rock, and Queen Latifah. Parsons also added children's novelist
   to her extensive resume. Her first book, How High the Moon, came out
   this March and tells the story of a light-skinned Black girl growing up
   in the Jim Crow-era South. Partly based on her own mother's early life
   in South Carolina and Boston, Parson’s debut was praised for being "as
   historically illuminating as Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry."

Reboots and reunions

   Now hard at work on her second novel and busy turning the Sweet
   Blackberry films into picture books, Parsons still makes time for
   reunions with her Fresh Prince family—and is mulling possible future
   collaborations.

   "Whenever the cast all gets together, inevitably Will will be like, 'We
   should do this all the time,'" she says. "And we all look at him like,
   'It's you that's hard to nail down!' It's like we all just pick up
   where we left off."

   Notably absent from their get-togethers: original Aunt Viv actress
   Janet Hubert, who was fired after season three and replaced by Daphne
   Maxwell Reid. In the years since, Hubert has spoken out about her
   strained relationship with the cast, alleging drama with Smith
   ultimately led to her ousting.

   "I would love to have Janet at the reunions if there wasn't tension,"
   says Parsons. "But I don't think she'd want to come anyway because
   she's been very upset about how things went down with her firing. That
   was a difficult situation, and it's not one that she's at peace with.
   It was odd how it all went down. I don't think it was easy for anybody
   to witness. I don't think it was expected—It wasn't expected by me,
   that's for sure."

   While in the past Parsons has said she's "not interested" in any sort
   of Fresh Prince 2.0 following Avery's death, she clarifies now that the
   only thing off-limits to her is a "straight-up reboot."

   "I love these folks, and I loved working with them," she says. "If they
   did a different incarnation of the show—if we were suddenly animated or
   if it was a spinoff kind of thing, then I can see the potential."

   Imagine: Hilary coping with her VSCO Girl daughters! Uncle Carlton
   forced to move in with them after getting caught up in a college
   admissions scandal to get Baby Nicky into ULA! Will Smith stopping by
   for a producer credit and occasional headline-making cameo! Netflix,
   snap this up.

   And although Parsons, who turns 50 this month, has yet to hear any
   formal discussion of a revamped series, it's clear Smith is eager to
   keep the show on fans' minds: This week, he announced a new sportswear
   collection, Bel-Air Athletics, based on his immortal looks from the
   series and coinciding with a recently launched verified @freshprince
   Instagram account.

   "Maybe Will has something up his sleeve," she says. "If folks are
   interested in me being involved in a reboot, of course, I wouldn't
   hesitate."

Here's Even More Audio of Shane Gillis From ‘Saturday Night Live’ Gleefully
Saying Slurs

While the YouTube video has since been made private, the audio footage from
the May 2019 recording of 'Real Ass Podcast' remains online.

   This article originally appeared on VICE US

   Newly anointed Saturday Night Live cast member Shane Gillis called
   Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang a "Jew c---k" in a
   podcast episode recorded in May of this year. The episode of Real Ass
   Podcast, hosted by comedians Luis J. Gomez and Zac Amico, was
   previously accessible in a YouTube video that has since been made
   private. The episode's audio, however, is still available online.

   IFRAME:
   https://www.vice.com/en_us/embed/article/43ka33/who-the-hell-is-shane-g
   illis-comedian-podcast-the-newest-hire-on-saturday-night-live?utm_sourc
   e=stylizedembed_vice.com&utm_campaign=wjwxxw&site=vice

   Gillis's hiring as one of SNL's new featured players was announced on
   Thursday. He came under fire within hours over racist and homophobic
   slurs in episodes of his own podcast, co-hosted with Matt McCusker,
   recorded last year. He released a statement that night describing
   himself as "a comedian who pushes boundaries" but sometimes misses.
   "I'm happy to apologize to anyone who's actually offended by anything
   I've said," Gillis wrote. "My intention is never to hurt anyone but I
   am trying to be the best comedian I can be and sometimes that requires
   risks."

   Gillis took several of those "risks" in the Real Ass Podcast episode,
   number 402, recorded on Memorial Day 2019. The reference to Yang
   revolves around a callback to a moment earlier in the episode, around
   46 minutes and 30 seconds in. In that segment, Gomez riffs about a
   candy he describes as a small wax bottle containing an unsatisfying
   amount of sweet liquid (he appears to be describing the Nik-L-Lip).
   "What a fuckin' scam that was," he says. He starts to say, "whoever
   came up with that is the—" when Gillis jumps in and says "c----s." The
   entire group—Gomez, Amico, Gillis, and comic Mike Figs—appears to erupt
   in laughter, and one of the comics sings "ch-ch-ch-chi-ch-c----s" over
   a drum sting. "Shane Gillis crushing it with a one-word racist
   punchline," Gomez says. "One of my favorites."

   Gillis's subsequent use of the slur occurs around one hour and six
   minutes into the episode. The comics are riffing about Bernie Sanders,
   whom Gillis describes as Mario to Dick Cheney's Wario. The riff
   descends into awkwardness, and Gillis says his Wario joke was the best
   joke of the episode. Gomez responds, "your c---k line was 40 times
   better." Some cross-talk ensues in which Gillis remarks on his frequent
   use of that slur, before directing it to Sanders: "That Jew c---k?
   Commie Jew c---k? Next, please, next. Gimme your next candidate, Dems.
   Jew c---k, next. Actually, they are running a Jew c---k—Chang, dude."
   Then the conversation turns to author and life coach Tony Robbins.

   These were not the only instances of hateful language directed toward
   Asian people in the episode. About an hour in, the group prepares for a
   segment in which they watch a random podcast; in this case, their
   producer has chosen the video podcast "Make Money Travel Blogging
   Featuring Jacob Fu." Upon learning the name, the group, led by Gillis,
   breaks out into exaggerated Chinese accents. When the video starts
   playing, Gillis exclaims, "I was making fun of these guys for being
   Asian—they're so hot. Look at these hot guys, dude… he speaks so much
   better than all of us." He chides one of his fellow comics to stop
   speaking in a mocking accent. "Now it's very racist. These guys speak
   great, they're handsome… Those are nice handsome boys having fun."

   Then Gillis appears to start describing the group. "Fat ugly idiots
   promoting hate, that's what this is," he says. "That's what this is?"
   Gomez responds. "Yeah, look at all of us," Gillis says. "We're all
   shitty people. At least those Asians were having fun."

   VICE has reached out to Gillis and NBC for comment.

A Guide to VH1's Drunk, Loud, Unapologetic Golden Age of Reality TV

'Flavor of 'Rock of Love,' 'Flavor of Love,' 'I Love New York,' and others
are on Prime, so it's time to revisit Somethin's staircase poop.

   Credit: VH1

   Amazon did a great service recently when they made almost the entire
   catalog of VH1's mid- to late-00s reality TV series available to stream
   on Prime. Spanning roughly from 2006 to 2010, a time period which
   yielded such glorious shows as Flavor of Love, Rock of Love, and I Love
   New York, this is, undoubtedly, an opportunity to re-immerse oneself in
   the golden era of trash television. Without these now-classic shows,
   the world would never know Tiffany "New York" Pollard, the most GIFable
   queen of the entire internet. It would never learn that "people who eat
   basil are lame," or that "stripper shoes go with any outfit," among
   other gems of wisdom from Rock of Love Bus's glorious (and often
   wasted) cast member Ashley Klarich. Truly, this earth would have been
   worse off had it never been privy to Tykeisha "Somethin" Thomas from
   Flavor of Love season 2 infamously defecating on the staircase after a
   clock ceremony (more on this later), or Nikki taking a test-tube shot
   out of Gia's vagina on Rock of Love. These contestants and their
   hijinks were far from the Hannahs and Laurens of The Bachelor universe,
   unafraid to let their freak flags wave, get laid, get drunk, be loud,
   and drag each other ruthlessly.

   While there's now an entire universe of 90 Day Fiancé and more than
   half a dozen Real Housewives franchises fulfilling our raccoon-like
   need to devour absolute garbage, VH1's staple lineup of 00s reality TV
   just hit differently. These shows were unhinged in strange and
   hilarious ways, and remain endlessly quotable, memeable, and, now,
   nostalgic for reality TV fans. These characters' willingness to go to
   astronomical levels of absurdity and all-out, televised chaos for the
   object of their (heavily staged) affection remains mesmerizing,
   undoubtedly egged on by producers and accentuated by editors' additions
   of tongue-in-cheek sound and visual effects (like Flavor of Love's
   Hottie getting a bike chime noise every time she blinked her big, false
   lashes at someone).

   Now, years after their sell-by date, we can joyously revisit these
   wonderfully subversive pieces of reality TV perfection. Here's a
   helpful guide to VH1's greatest shows, all of which embody the wildness
   of an abandoned amusement park run by feral badgers.

If it's rap legends, boss bitches, and bodily fluids you crave, get a taste
of Flavor of Love.

   After his breakup with 80s actress Brigitte Nielsen (their relationship
   was documented in the aptly titled series Strange Love, a spin-off of
   The Surreal Life), VH1 producers gave Public Enemy's Flavor Flav the
   chance to find The One on Flavor of Love, a dating series that parodied
   The Bachelor. Unlike The Bachelor, however, the series featured a
   racially diverse cast of women vying for one of Flav's trademark clocks
   to wear around their necks, signifying that they would advance to the
   next round. While many Black writers called out the show for being
   exploitative and perpetuating offensive stereotypes, the series was a
   ratings beast that lasted three seasons and led to multiple spinoffs,
   and the women that stepped into Flav's mansion became some of the
   greatest contestants in reality TV history thanks to their
   unapologetic, unadulterated personalities. They kept it real at all
   times, leading to scenes and lines that are still fondly memorialized
   on the internet to this day. There was Hottie's assurance that everyone
   says she reminds them of Beyoncé; Pumkin launching a spit missile at
   New York; the aforementioned poop on the staircase incident (Somethin
   explained that she tried to hold it, but her stomach said, "Bitch,
   you've got me fucked up;" Flav then applauded Somethin for being "real
   with it"); and too many moments from Tiffany "New York" Pollard to
   count. For two seasons, New York ran the other women ragged,
   implementing grade-A trash talk, stare-downs, and fearlessness in
   pursuit of her man Flav. Her iconic level of drama rendered her worthy
   of various spin-offs, a Brooklyn art show of works created in her
   honor, and a throne as the reigning as the queen of reaction GIFs.
   Every minute of television where the camera is on New York is worth the
   watch.

   Watch on: Seasons 1 and 3 on Amazon Prime, Seasons 1 and 2 on Hulu

If you stan stripper heels, giant breast implants, and hair teased to the
heavens, look no further than Rock of Love.

   yle-from-bret-michaelss-girls-on-bars?utm_source=stylizedembed_vice.com
   &utm_campaign=ywa5ey&site=vice

   For three seasons, Bret Michaels—best known as the lead singer of
   hair-metal band Poison and the co-star of Pamela Anderson's
   lesser-known sex tape—searched America (and whatever part of France the
   extremely horny Angelique is from) to find his tour bus partner for
   life. The incessantly sloppy-drunk contestants came in hot, armed with
   an arsenal of clear heels, ass-cheek-grazing polyester dresses, and an
   insatiable desire to make out with Bret Michaels. But they were more
   than Sunset Strip groupies, strippers, and porn stars; they were women
   on a mission to get their man (and some screen time). There were
   standouts from all three seasons, like the big-haired, 80s metal
   goddess Heather, who got Michaels's name tattooed on her neck; the
   cackling, painfully earnest cowgirl Rodeo; and mean girl Ashley, whose
   magnificent implants and the way she said "bitch" made her extra
   larger-than-life. But those women were just a few in a kaleidoscope of
   big personalities, including one contestant who took everyone's used
   socks after a hockey match to keep for her personal use. In the end,
   Bret never found his true match, but the search yielded hours of
   premium entertainment.

   Watch on: Amazon Prime and Hulu

You love Tiffany Pollard? Then you'll definitely love I Love New York.

   After two unsuccessful efforts to win Flav's final clock, Pollard
   landed a spin-off dating show of her own. For two seasons, Pollard and
   her frighteningly brutal mom, Sister Patterson, put a group of studs
   and duds through the absolute ringer as they pledged their undying love
   for New York. Within that group were some standouts that made for
   excellent television, like excruciatingly dweeby white boy Mr. Boston,
   mouthy "stallionaire" Chance, his more tender brother Real (who
   tragically died of colon cancer in 2015), outspoken little person
   Midget Mac, Italian mama's boy Frank the Entertainer, and countless
   others. There was toe sucking, speedo wearing, a pretty bad nosebleed,
   and a fervent church service led by Sister Patterson. It was worth
   watching for Pollard's electrifying presence alone, but became a true
   carnival thanks to the full cast and their antics.

   Watch on: Hulu

If dudes who look like Criss Angel get you going, pick Daisy of Love.

   Rock of Love season 2 runner-up Daisy de la Hoya (yes, she is related
   to boxer Oscar de la Hoya) didn't leave with the man of her rock 'n'
   roll dreams. But the heavily lip-plumped rock chick did score her own
   one-season spin-off in which 20 dudes that look like they ransacked
   Dave Navarro's closet fought for her affection. The show also featured
   a set of glammed-out triplets who claimed to be Swedish rock stars in a
   band called Snake of Eden and enjoyed eating raw hot dogs out of the
   package. It's a leather-cuff and nautical-star tornado in there, and
   it's gold.

   Watch on: Amazon Prime and Hulu

If it's a group of lingerie-clad women flipping off outdated ideas of
respectability you like, go with Charm School.

   Charm School sought to do the impossible: reform the hard-partying and
   harder-fighting women from Flavor of Love and Rock of Love, and turn
   them into polite, well-behaved ladies. It did so in grossly outdated
   ways, like telling the women to dress and behave less sexually. But the
   ladies fought back in every possible way, finding it hard to leave
   their boozing, trash-talking, and wearing-lingerie-as-outerwear ways
   behind them. (Bless them for that.) Hosted by Mo'Nique, Sharon
   Osbourne, and Ricki Lake in seasons 1, 2, and 3, respectively, the show
   saw contestants forced to perform challenges aimed at molding them into
   business-savvy, self-sufficient women, and in some cases, contestants
   seemed to actually care about evolving into better versions of
   themselves. But many others weren't even trying, and the show will be
   forever remembered as the one where Osbourne beat up aspiring trophy
   wife Megan Hauserman after she insulted Ozzy Osbourne during the season
   2 reunion. Not the most charming moment.

   Watch on: All seasons on Amazon Prime, season 1 on Hulu

That Iconic Pic of Phoebe Waller-Bridge Smoking Was Almost Blocked by Amazon

"Smoking is always off-limits," a source reportedly said.

   The 2019 Emmys were mostly a wonky mess full of awkward TikTok jokes
   and terrifying Meryl Streep masks, but at least one genuinely good
   thing came out of it: that truly blessed image of Fleabag's Phoebe
   Waller-Bridge chilling so hard after winning a zillion much-deserved
   Emmys. The world collectively lost its mind when BBC comedy head Josh
   Cole tweeted it out last week, and since then, it has circulated
   nonstop with a million different captions about its aspirational
   qualities. But regardless, let's just take a minute and soak it in once
   again, because the sheer awesome power of the image has yet to lose its
   luster:

   It is a vibe worthy of at least an Emmy nomination on its own, but
   according to Hollywood Reporter, we almost didn't get to see it at
   all—because, apparently, Amazon doesn't approve of its stars smoking.

   Sources told the THR that Amazon was on-hand during that fateful
   Chateau Marmont afterparty, and already successfully foiled a few
   photographers from taking pictures of Waller-Bridge as she celebrated
   her post-Emmys win by ripping a cig. Luckily, the Amazon folks weren't
   fast enough to stop Cole from shooting his shot, but THR's source
   imagines the studio isn't exactly happy about it.

   com&utm_campaign=8xwvex&site=vice

   "I'm sure people are upset that [Cole's] photo made it out," the source
   said, according to Hollywood Reporter. "Smoking is always off-limits.
   But she was having fun and acting carefree."

   If by "having fun and acting carefree" the source meant "elegantly
   basking in the kind of meteoric success that the rest of us can only
   dream of," then, yes, that seems right. We common plebes are all lucky
   that Cole managed to evade the Amazon wet blankets and deliver us this
   sacred photo.

   Thank you for your service, Cole. The world needed to bare witness to
   such a blessed moment. We are forever grateful.

What Happened to 'Fresh Prince' Star Karyn Parsons?

The actress opens up to VICE about her very un-Hilary Banks-like life.

   What Ever Happened to...? is a biweekly investigation into the
   whereabouts of former icons. This installment dives deep into the life
   of Karyn Parsons, perhaps best known as Hilary Banks from the Fresh
   Prince of Bel-Air.

   If the 90s had a TV poster child for its shameless excess and unbridled
   confidence, her name would be Hilary Banks.
   Advertisement

   From 1990 to 1996, Karyn Parsons played The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air's
   eldest Banks sibling who, much like the shopping malls she so loved to
   frequent, lived squarely in a void of shallow consumerism. Hilary Banks
   was the Gordon Gekko of Rodeo Drive and represented an American Dream
   in which even a privileged, valley(-adjacent) girl with no common sense
   could stumble into a career as a national talk show host.

   But in the years after Fresh Prince ended, Parsons' name recognition
   faded in a world still decades away from salivating over every morsel
   of 90s nostalgia.

   "Not that I expected people to know who I was, but even when I'd try to
   tell casting directors what I'd done before, they would have no idea,"
   she tells VICE. "I started feeling really stupid trying to get them to
   know what Fresh Prince was and who I was on it. It was embarrassing.
   I'd feel like a moron, like, 'Oh, it was this show in the 90s.'"

   Now, this is a story all about how Karyn Parsons' post-sitcom life got
   flipped, turned upside down into one of advocacy, novels, and, yes,
   possibly reboots.

In Santa Monica, born and raised

   There were no "Dad, I need $300" moments in Parsons' childhood. While
   Parsons technically grew up less than eight miles from ritzy Bel-Air,
   her modest 1970s and 80s upbringing was a far cry from that of the
   Banks children. Rather than being waited on by a live-in British
   butler, Parsons spent most of her youth moving to various "little
   apartments" around then-"hippie-ish" Santa Monica with her mom, a
   deputy-sheriff-turned-bra-and-swimsuit-model-turned-librarian, while
   her father was "mostly absent."

   "We were lower middle class, borderline—we weren't poor. I never went
   without food or anything like that," she says. "But there was a period
   where my mom needed food stamps."

   Parsons identifies as biracial, the product of "a bizarre, odd couple"
   made up of "this really quirky-looking, Woody Allen-like guy" and "this
   amazing Tamara Dobson, Cleopatra Jones-looking, six-foot-tall Amazon
   woman." And she was one of the only "mixed kids" at her public school
   (Lenny Kravitz was another).

   "Even growing up with a white father and a Black mother, I didn't
   suffer a lot of feeling really uncomfortable about how different I was
   from others. I think that had a lot to do with the spirit of the time.
   It was a very Free to Be... You and Me upbringing. Not that I didn't
   experience racism, because of course I did—I was called the N-word—but
   it wasn't as overt as some other friends of mine experienced at that
   age."

   She focused her energy on becoming an actress, a dream that could have
   met an early end in ninth grade when she was dramatically banned from
   her high school theater program after one of her friends cheated off
   another's paper.

   "I was totally innocent! I wish I could brag and say that I was one of
   the troublemakers, but I was just one of the peanut gallery on the
   side," she says. "We were all banned from any production for the rest
   of our stay at the school. I look back now and I'm like, that shit
   would not fly with my daughter. I would be in there so fast with that
   theater arts teacher, like, 'Are you out of your mind?' But I don't
   think I told my mom. I don't think I breathed a word to her. I just
   kind of suffered this horrible fate and sucked it up."

   Her punishment may have been a blessing in disguise. Without a creative
   outlet at school, Parsons threw herself full force into a serious
   community acting workshop, where she studied Stanislavski and Hagen and
   spent any extra time she had on the audition circuit.

   Enter executive producer Quincy Jones and a pilot for a new
   fish-out-of-water sitcom centered on an affluent Black family. In 1990,
   with just three bit TV roles to her name—which, to be fair, was still
   more acting experience than Will Smith had at the time—Parsons nabbed
   the role of Hilary Banks.

The princess of Bel-Air

   We owe the existence of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air to Will Smith's tax
   problems. Nearly bankrupt and millions in debt to the IRS after his
   early musical success, Smith jumped at the chance for a steady,
   lucrative gig. For the first three seasons, 70 percent of his TV
   paychecks went straight to the government.

   While the NBC sitcom took time to find its ratings footing (by its
   third season, it was America's most popular show with an all-Black
   cast), its stars clicked instantly.

   "I suddenly had a sister [Tatyana Ali], I had a little brother [Alfonso
   Ribeiro], Will was like a brother," Parsons says. "Even the crew was
   like family. Everyone embraced each other and cared about each other.
   Even if it stopped right with the pilot, it would have still been a
   life-changing experience for me."

   Perhaps most crucially for Parsons was the arrival of a new father
   figure in the form of James Avery, the actor who played Uncle Phil. "He
   was so much like 'Dad.' He took that role very seriously on camera and
   off. My dad was not a typical dad, and James was," she says. "He was
   very affectionate and warm and always paid attention to who I was going
   out with, and if he saw them, he had to shake his finger in their face.
   He was great." (Avery died in 2013 at age 68 from complications
   following open heart surgery.)

   But in 1996, after six seasons and 148 episodes, NBC cancelled Fresh
   Prince and the close-knit cast went their separate ways. "It was
   devastating to suddenly be stripped away from them," says Parsons.
   "Everybody else went home to their families when it was over, and I
   pretty much went home to my two dogs and that was it."

More than one night at The Roxbury

   It took time for Parsons' new reality to set in. Virtually her entire
   adulthood had been spent cloaked in the comforting monotony of studio
   audience laughs and craft services lunches. Now, she found herself in a
   daze, and it took a run-in with her former junior-high friend Lenny
   Kravitz—whose mom had been a sitcom star on The Jeffersons—to shake her
   out of it.

   "I bumped into him not that long after Fresh Prince had been off, and
   he was the first person who looked at me and said, 'But how are you
   really doing?' Whether he meant it to laser in like that, it hit me,"
   she says. "It was the first time I really acknowledged that I wasn't
   doing that well. I was kind of tap dancing as fast as I could and not
   paying attention to the fact that it was a struggle."

   Meanwhile, substantial roles for women of color in the 90s were few and
   far between. During seasonal breaks on Fresh Prince, Parsons had
   managed to book films like Major Payne and Class Act but found it
   difficult to find decent projects even once freed of the hectic
   schedule of network TV.

   "There were a handful of actresses that were doing the work, and most
   of their names were Halle Berry," she laughs. "I was always like,
   'Halle got it again!' It seemed like there were so few roles and Halle
   was working like crazy, deservedly so."

   Parsons carved out her own opportunity in the form of a feminist sitcom
   called Lush Life that she co-created, produced, and starred in with pal
   Lori Petty. But the series premiered to dismal reviews (from mostly
   male critics) in September 1996, and after just four episodes aired,
   Fox pulled the plug.

   "It was a learning experience. Man, I learned so much doing that show,"
   Parsons says. "I've never worked so hard, but all of the new Fox
   comedies were taken off [when studio execs changed that year]. It
   didn't matter how well we had tested—because our show had tested really
   well—everything got yanked."

   Outside of work, Parsons and Petty became regulars at Hollywood's
   legendary Roxbury nightclub, known for its VIP clientele and celebrity
   drama.

   "I had a lot of fun times there, but there was also a lot of that
   chasing the dragon kind of thing," she says. "I remember it got to the
   point when Lori and I had worked out, and we'd show up at the Roxbury
   with our hair pulled up and no makeup in sweatpants and sneakers, and
   the bouncer would let us through, past everybody else, into the club.
   We had gotten so lazy about it. It was weird. All that shine was
   probably wearing off a little bit. You go expecting that same feeling,
   and then after a while, it's kind of like, why are we here?"

Starting over

   Eager for a change of scenery, Parsons moved to New York and continued
   acting in films like Mixing Nia and The Ladies Man, as well as Denis
   Leary's short-lived 2001 detective comedy The Job. Her cross-country
   move also led her to her now-husband, filmmaker Alexandre Rockwell,
   whom she met at a mutual friend's restaurant opening. They married in
   2003, and welcomed a daughter named Lana that same year. Their son,
   Nico, followed in 2007.

   "My interests were changing," she says. "It became very difficult to do
   everything, to memorize lines for a part and have to get someone to
   last-minute watch the kids—to race across town and do all that, and if
   you got a call back, do it again. I'd find myself dropping the ball a
   lot."

   Parsons began focusing on writing, and in 2005 founded the non-profit
   organization Sweet Blackberry, aimed at educating children about
   little-known parts of African American history. The idea had been
   simmering for years, ever since her librarian mom had first brought
   stories like that of Henry "Box" Brown—a slave who literally mailed
   himself to freedom—to her attention.

   "When I was pregnant with my daughter, that's when I started really
   thinking about what are they going to teach her in school, and what am
   I supposed to teach her? How do I supplement her education as a
   parent?" Parsons says. "As I was talking a lot about Black history and
   stories that you don't hear about, my husband was like, you need to do
   this."

   Fourteen years later, Sweet Blackberry has grown from a passion project
   into a thriving organization with a series of animated short films
   available on DVD and Netflix narrated by the likes of Alfre Woodard,
   Chris Rock, and Queen Latifah. Parsons also added children's novelist
   to her extensive resume. Her first book, How High the Moon, came out
   this March and tells the story of a light-skinned Black girl growing up
   in the Jim Crow-era South. Partly based on her own mother's early life
   in South Carolina and Boston, Parson’s debut was praised for being "as
   historically illuminating as Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry."

Reboots and reunions

   Now hard at work on her second novel and busy turning the Sweet
   Blackberry films into picture books, Parsons still makes time for
   reunions with her Fresh Prince family—and is mulling possible future
   collaborations.

   "Whenever the cast all gets together, inevitably Will will be like, 'We
   should do this all the time,'" she says. "And we all look at him like,
   'It's you that's hard to nail down!' It's like we all just pick up
   where we left off."

   Notably absent from their get-togethers: original Aunt Viv actress
   Janet Hubert, who was fired after season three and replaced by Daphne
   Maxwell Reid. In the years since, Hubert has spoken out about her
   strained relationship with the cast, alleging drama with Smith
   ultimately led to her ousting.

   "I would love to have Janet at the reunions if there wasn't tension,"
   says Parsons. "But I don't think she'd want to come anyway because
   she's been very upset about how things went down with her firing. That
   was a difficult situation, and it's not one that she's at peace with.
   It was odd how it all went down. I don't think it was easy for anybody
   to witness. I don't think it was expected—It wasn't expected by me,
   that's for sure."

   While in the past Parsons has said she's "not interested" in any sort
   of Fresh Prince 2.0 following Avery's death, she clarifies now that the
   only thing off-limits to her is a "straight-up reboot."

   "I love these folks, and I loved working with them," she says. "If they
   did a different incarnation of the show—if we were suddenly animated or
   if it was a spinoff kind of thing, then I can see the potential."

   Imagine: Hilary coping with her VSCO Girl daughters! Uncle Carlton
   forced to move in with them after getting caught up in a college
   admissions scandal to get Baby Nicky into ULA! Will Smith stopping by
   for a producer credit and occasional headline-making cameo! Netflix,
   snap this up.

   And although Parsons, who turns 50 this month, has yet to hear any
   formal discussion of a revamped series, it's clear Smith is eager to
   keep the show on fans' minds: This week, he announced a new sportswear
   collection, Bel-Air Athletics, based on his immortal looks from the
   series and coinciding with a recently launched verified @freshprince
   Instagram account.

   "Maybe Will has something up his sleeve," she says. "If folks are
   interested in me being involved in a reboot, of course, I wouldn't
   hesitate."
