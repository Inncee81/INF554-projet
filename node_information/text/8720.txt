From rapper to pilgrim: French celebrity Diam’s life-changing visit to a
Muslim friend

     * "Before converting to Islam, I felt a sadness in my life", Mélanie
       Georgiades tells Arab News

   Updated 09 August 2019

   JEDDAH: She had money, fame, influence and power. By the age of 23, she
   had millions of fans, sold more than 4 million albums and won numerous
   awards.

   Writing and performing numerous hit singles and records one after the
   other, by 2007, Mélanie Georgiades, better known by her stage name
   Diam’s, seemed to have it all, living the life that many dreamed of.

   Yet, despite her success, she felt unfulfilled and deeply troubled
   about her life, something that made her search for answers, finding new
   hope and happiness in life in converting to Islam.

   “All this stuff, the money, the success, the power did not make me
   happy,” Georgiades told Arab News while in Makkah. “I was searching for
   happiness; I was very, very sad, and I was alone. I was wondering why I
   was on this earth. I knew it was not to be rich or famous, because I
   had those things, and they did not make me happy. So, I began searching
   for answers to all my questions.”

   As hard as Georgiades looked for those answers, they eluded her despite
   her successful music career.

   Then, one day in 2008, having just had her two most musically
   successful years in which she won the MTV European Music Award for Best
   French Artist as well as the NRJ Music Awards for Best Artist, Best
   Album, and Best Song, Georgiades’ life changed while visiting her
   friend, Sousou, who was a Muslim.

     It was a revelation. I became intimately convinced that God existed.
     The more I was reading, the more convinced I became. Up until then,
     I believed in one God, but I was Christian in my heart, or rather,
     did not know exactly what I was, except sad.

     Mélanie Georgiades

   During that visit, Sousou asked that she be excused for a few minutes
   to go perform her evening prayers in the other room. Suddenly,
   Georgiades felt compelled to join her friend in prayer. Despite not
   knowing how Muslims prayed, she followed what Sousou was doing and
   prostrated herself before Allah for the first time in her life.

   “When I prayed with her and I prostrated myself, I felt being connected
   with God,” Georgiades said.

   Soon after that, she obtained a copy of the Holy Qur’an and began
   reading it while on a trip to Mauritius.

   “It was a revelation,” she said. “I became intimately convinced that
   God existed. The more I was reading, the more convinced I became. Up
   until then, I believed in one God, but I was Christian in my heart, or
   rather, did not know exactly what I was, except sad.”

   In December 2008, Georgiades converted to Islam and disappeared
   entirely from the music scene and the public’s eyes. However, in 2009,
   she found herself quickly thrust back into it when a press photographer
   photographed her coming out of a mosque in Gennevilliers, in France,
   wearing the hijab and covered from head to toe in a burka.

   Those photographs were published in Paris Match magazine and were met
   with shock and horror by French society who knew her as Diam’s, the
   hip-hop music icon who performed while wearing tight pants and a
   tank-top.

   With the publication of that photo, she found herself being vilified in
   the French press.

   “Diam’s’ veil is a step backwards, a defeat,” Djemila Benhabib, a
   Canadian journalist who shared Georgiades’ Greek Cypriot roots, wrote
   indignantly. Benhabib was known for her strong opposition to what she
   calls Muslim fundamentalism.

    At the time, France was debating passing a law banning anyone from
   wearing a veil or covering their face while in a public place. Those
   photographs soon became central in that debate, leading to Georgiades
   finding herself the subject of public hatred.

   In November of 2009, Georgiades felt it necessary to explain to her
   fans what led her to change her focus in life toward religion, and
   returned to music for one last time, releasing her single “Children of
   the Desert” from her album “SOS.”

   In the song she describes the intolerance of society in France, stating
   that society had been far from supportive of her after she converted to
   Islam, leaving her feeling betrayed herself looking for a new life
   elsewhere.

   The lyrics of that last song, “Children of the Desert,” described how
   she felt at the time of her unveiling as a Muslim, writing the lyrics,
   “It was either humanitarian help or trying to become a billionaire, I
   made my choice and to hell with you, may those who love me follow
   me.”“This is going to be my second Hajj, but this time I am coming with
   a different mindset.”

   Despite her troubles, she was more at peace than at any other time in
   her life.

   “Before converting to Islam, I felt a sadness in my life because I did
   not realize that all I had to do was talk to God,” Georgiades said.
   “Now, everything that is good in my life, or bad, I know that I have
   Allah who listens to me and answers my prayers.”

   Some years later, in 2017, Georgiades was able to move to Saudi Arabia
   along with her husband, a former Franco-Tunisian rapper, Faouzi
   Tarkhani. For the past two years they have made their home in the
   Kingdom, away from the Islamophobia and disdain she suffered in France.

   Georgiades and her husband have traveled to Makkah to perform Hajj this
   year.
   Among the other international celebrities performing Hajj this year are
   football stars Vassiriki Abou Diaby and Philippe Christanval, Tunisian
   martials arts champion Thabet Naghmouchi, and Tunisian paralympics gold
   medalist Raoua Tlili. (Essam Alghalib)

   “This is going to be my second Hajj, but this time I am coming with a
   different mindset,” she said. “Last time I came, I was a new Muslim and
   did not know the religion very well back then. But because I have now
   been a Muslim for many years, I have learned many things about Islam
   and the Sunnah and the Prophet (PBUH) and about the story of this land
   and of the Haramain. This Hajj will be quite different for me as I
   realize more now about the significance of the journey’s rituals and
   steps. It will be an even more spiritual experience than before,
   Inshallah.”

   Georgiades was not the only celebrity or influencer to be invited by
   the Ministry of Hajj and Umrah to perform the pilgrimage this year.

   Other celebrities invited by the ministry include Vassiriki Abou Diaby,
   who played for the Arsenal and Marseille football clubs, Philippe
   Christanval, who played for the Monaco and Barcelona Football Clubs,
   Thabet Naghmouchi, the reigning world champion in Kempo Karate from
   Tunisia, as well as Raoua Tlili, who won a gold medal for Tunisia in
   the discus throw at the London 2017 World Para Athletics Championships.

   All are now in Makkah ready for the pilgrimage to begin.

Iran’s claims about Saudi messages are inaccurate says Al-Jubeir

     * Al-Jubeir said Iran needs to stop interfering in the internal
       issues of Arab states
     * Tensions between the two states rose after the Sep. 14 Aramco
       attacks

   DUBAI: Iranian claims Saudi Arabia sent its government messages is
   inaccurate, Saudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel Al-Jubeir
   has said in a series of tweets.

   “What happened was that friendly nations were seeking to calm the
   situation, and we told them the Kingdom is always seeking peace and
   stability in the region,” Jubeir said.

   Al-Jubeir reiterated the Saudi stance towards Iran, urging the Islamic
   Republic to stop supporting terrorism and disruption through the
   interference in internal issues of Arab states, producing weapons of
   mass destruction and creating ballistic missile programs.

   “Act like a normal country, and not like a rouge terrorism-supporting
   state,” he added.

   Tensions between the two states increased after Saudi Arabia blamed
   Tehran for the Sep. 14 Aramco oil facilities attack, which was claimed
   by Houthi militia.

   Iran denies the charges, although they support the Houthis in Yemen.

   “The Kingdom has not and will not discuss Yemen with the Iranian
   regime,” Al-Jubeir said.

   Yemen belongs to Yemenis, and the Iranian interference is the reason
   behind the war, he added.

From rapper to pilgrim: French celebrity Diam’s life-changing visit to a
Muslim friend

     * "Before converting to Islam, I felt a sadness in my life", Mélanie
       Georgiades tells Arab News

   Updated 09 August 2019

   JEDDAH: She had money, fame, influence and power. By the age of 23, she
   had millions of fans, sold more than 4 million albums and won numerous
   awards.

   Writing and performing numerous hit singles and records one after the
   other, by 2007, Mélanie Georgiades, better known by her stage name
   Diam’s, seemed to have it all, living the life that many dreamed of.

   Yet, despite her success, she felt unfulfilled and deeply troubled
   about her life, something that made her search for answers, finding new
   hope and happiness in life in converting to Islam.

   “All this stuff, the money, the success, the power did not make me
   happy,” Georgiades told Arab News while in Makkah. “I was searching for
   happiness; I was very, very sad, and I was alone. I was wondering why I
   was on this earth. I knew it was not to be rich or famous, because I
   had those things, and they did not make me happy. So, I began searching
   for answers to all my questions.”

   As hard as Georgiades looked for those answers, they eluded her despite
   her successful music career.

   Then, one day in 2008, having just had her two most musically
   successful years in which she won the MTV European Music Award for Best
   French Artist as well as the NRJ Music Awards for Best Artist, Best
   Album, and Best Song, Georgiades’ life changed while visiting her
   friend, Sousou, who was a Muslim.

     It was a revelation. I became intimately convinced that God existed.
     The more I was reading, the more convinced I became. Up until then,
     I believed in one God, but I was Christian in my heart, or rather,
     did not know exactly what I was, except sad.

     Mélanie Georgiades

   During that visit, Sousou asked that she be excused for a few minutes
   to go perform her evening prayers in the other room. Suddenly,
   Georgiades felt compelled to join her friend in prayer. Despite not
   knowing how Muslims prayed, she followed what Sousou was doing and
   prostrated herself before Allah for the first time in her life.

   “When I prayed with her and I prostrated myself, I felt being connected
   with God,” Georgiades said.

   Soon after that, she obtained a copy of the Holy Qur’an and began
   reading it while on a trip to Mauritius.

   “It was a revelation,” she said. “I became intimately convinced that
   God existed. The more I was reading, the more convinced I became. Up
   until then, I believed in one God, but I was Christian in my heart, or
   rather, did not know exactly what I was, except sad.”

   In December 2008, Georgiades converted to Islam and disappeared
   entirely from the music scene and the public’s eyes. However, in 2009,
   she found herself quickly thrust back into it when a press photographer
   photographed her coming out of a mosque in Gennevilliers, in France,
   wearing the hijab and covered from head to toe in a burka.

   Those photographs were published in Paris Match magazine and were met
   with shock and horror by French society who knew her as Diam’s, the
   hip-hop music icon who performed while wearing tight pants and a
   tank-top.


   IFRAME: https://www.youtube.com/embed/N1dz9FfR7nI


   With the publication of that photo, she found herself being vilified in
   the French press.

   “Diam’s’ veil is a step backwards, a defeat,” Djemila Benhabib, a
   Canadian journalist who shared Georgiades’ Greek Cypriot roots, wrote
   indignantly. Benhabib was known for her strong opposition to what she
   calls Muslim fundamentalism.

    At the time, France was debating passing a law banning anyone from
   wearing a veil or covering their face while in a public place. Those
   photographs soon became central in that debate, leading to Georgiades
   finding herself the subject of public hatred.

   In November of 2009, Georgiades felt it necessary to explain to her
   fans what led her to change her focus in life toward religion, and
   returned to music for one last time, releasing her single “Children of
   the Desert” from her album “SOS.”

   In the song she describes the intolerance of society in France, stating
   that society had been far from supportive of her after she converted to
   Islam, leaving her feeling betrayed herself looking for a new life
   elsewhere.

   The lyrics of that last song, “Children of the Desert,” described how
   she felt at the time of her unveiling as a Muslim, writing the lyrics,
   “It was either humanitarian help or trying to become a billionaire, I
   made my choice and to hell with you, may those who love me follow
   me.”“This is going to be my second Hajj, but this time I am coming with
   a different mindset.”

   Despite her troubles, she was more at peace than at any other time in
   her life.

   “Before converting to Islam, I felt a sadness in my life because I did
   not realize that all I had to do was talk to God,” Georgiades said.
   “Now, everything that is good in my life, or bad, I know that I have
   Allah who listens to me and answers my prayers.”

   Some years later, in 2017, Georgiades was able to move to Saudi Arabia
   along with her husband, a former Franco-Tunisian rapper, Faouzi
   Tarkhani. For the past two years they have made their home in the
   Kingdom, away from the Islamophobia and disdain she suffered in France.

   Georgiades and her husband have traveled to Makkah to perform Hajj this
   year.
   Among the other international celebrities performing Hajj this year are
   football stars Vassiriki Abou Diaby and Philippe Christanval, Tunisian
   martials arts champion Thabet Naghmouchi, and Tunisian paralympics gold
   medalist Raoua Tlili. (Essam Alghalib)

   “This is going to be my second Hajj, but this time I am coming with a
   different mindset,” she said. “Last time I came, I was a new Muslim and
   did not know the religion very well back then. But because I have now
   been a Muslim for many years, I have learned many things about Islam
   and the Sunnah and the Prophet (PBUH) and about the story of this land
   and of the Haramain. This Hajj will be quite different for me as I
   realize more now about the significance of the journey’s rituals and
   steps. It will be an even more spiritual experience than before,
   Inshallah.”

   Georgiades was not the only celebrity or influencer to be invited by
   the Ministry of Hajj and Umrah to perform the pilgrimage this year.

   Other celebrities invited by the ministry include Vassiriki Abou Diaby,
   who played for the Arsenal and Marseille football clubs, Philippe
   Christanval, who played for the Monaco and Barcelona Football Clubs,
   Thabet Naghmouchi, the reigning world champion in Kempo Karate from
   Tunisia, as well as Raoua Tlili, who won a gold medal for Tunisia in
   the discus throw at the London 2017 World Para Athletics Championships.

   All are now in Makkah ready for the pilgrimage to begin.

Iran’s claims about Saudi messages are inaccurate says Al-Jubeir

     * Al-Jubeir said Iran needs to stop interfering in the internal
       issues of Arab states
     * Tensions between the two states rose after the Sep. 14 Aramco
       attacks

   DUBAI: Iranian claims Saudi Arabia sent its government messages is
   inaccurate, Saudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel Al-Jubeir
   has said in a series of tweets.

   “What happened was that friendly nations were seeking to calm the
   situation, and we told them the Kingdom is always seeking peace and
   stability in the region,” Jubeir said.

   Al-Jubeir reiterated the Saudi stance towards Iran, urging the Islamic
   Republic to stop supporting terrorism and disruption through the
   interference in internal issues of Arab states, producing weapons of
   mass destruction and creating ballistic missile programs.

   “Act like a normal country, and not like a rouge terrorism-supporting
   state,” he added.

   Tensions between the two states increased after Saudi Arabia blamed
   Tehran for the Sep. 14 Aramco oil facilities attack, which was claimed
   by Houthi militia.

   Iran denies the charges, although they support the Houthis in Yemen.

   “The Kingdom has not and will not discuss Yemen with the Iranian
   regime,” Al-Jubeir said.

   Yemen belongs to Yemenis, and the Iranian interference is the reason
   behind the war, he added.
