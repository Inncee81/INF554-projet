Posted 2018-12-31FluxBB 1.5.11 released

   I am glad to finally announce the next patch release of FluxBB: version
   1.5.11.

Feature updates

     * Increase minimum password length
     * Prohibit links in topic subjects (based on existing anti-spam
       permission)
     * Allow longer SMTP passwords
     * Return correct HTTP status code on error and maintenance pages (to
       prevent search engines from indexing)
     * Prevent duplicate bans
     * User profiles: Use user's date/time formats, not the viewer's
     * Improve error message for very short searches

   Please check out the details in the full changelog. In addition, this
   release fixes nine bugs, some of which affect...

Security

     * Proper CSRF protection for rebuilding the search index, logging in
       and promoting users
     * Stop using insecure random number generator on certain PHP versions
     * Fix insufficient escaping of HTML output in installer and error
       pages

   This release has benefited from contributions by jasonrohrer, nsuchy
   and Visman. Thank you!

   I also want to thank TheBritain, Visman, Li of SEC Consult
   Vulnerability Lab and Omar Kurt of Netsparker for respectfully and
   responsibly disclosing security-relevant issues.

Project update

   As you know, this is the first release in a long time. I have decided
   to continue giving FluxBB the maintenance it deserves. However, I need
   support to achieve this. Before I announce all of my plans, as a token
   of goodwill and to regain some trust, I plan to release the
   long-awaited v1.6 within the next few weeks. This release will clean up
   some of the dusty bits under the hood of FluxBB. By removing support
   for old PHP and browser versions, we can lay the foundations to
   carefully modernize the codebase, while staying true to the spirit of
   FluxBB. This means that 1.5.11 is the last release to support PHP 4
   (which is horribly outdated). In addition, 1.6 will get some
   much-needed love in the realm of security hardening.

   With that out of the way: please go ahead and download the new version
   on the downloads page. If you are upgrading an existing forum, you can
   find instructions and resources on the upgrade page.

   Enjoy using FluxBB and stay tuned for more news on v1.6!
