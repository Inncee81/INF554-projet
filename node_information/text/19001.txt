   Assistant Professor, Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern
   University

   Assistant professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern
   University, and Northwestern Institute on Complex Systems (NICO).

   How do we, humans, understand the world: categorize and accumulate
   our knowledge, and thereby innovate idea, culture, and technologies? Is
   there any universal mechanism that governs such innovation process that
   eventually generates both social and economic wealth across different
   societies? A common conceptualization of innovation in both the
   biological and socio-economic domains sees it as an adaptive process of
   recombinant search over a space of configurational possibilities. I
   develop a mathematical framework for recombinant search in the space of
   configurational possibilities supported strongly by empirical data. The
   better we understand the mechanism of innovation the better we
   understand the mechanism of wealth creation.

   Research goals: Develop a mathematical framework for economic growth
   through innovation and tacit knowledge accumulation based strongly on
   empirical data; Understand universality in the way humans categorizes
   the world, accumulate knowledge, and innovate new technologies.

   Fields: PhD and BA in Statistical Physics at Korea Advanced Institute
   of Science and Technology; Research fellow at the Mathematical
   Institute at University of Oxford; Institute for New Economic Thinking;
   applied mathematics, physics, network theory, urban scaling theory,
   urban economics, urban geography, knowledge spillover, linguistics,
   lexical semantics, innovation, science of science, economic growth
   theory; research fellow at Santa Fe Institute and Harvard Kennedy
   School.

David Krakauer

   President and William H. Miller Professor of Complex Systems

   David’s research focuses on the evolutionary history of information
   processing mechanisms in biology and culture. This includes genetic,
   neural, linguistic and cultural mechanisms. The research spans multiple
   levels of organization, seeking analogous patterns and principles in
   genetics, cell biology, microbiology and in organismal behavior and
   society. At the cellular level David has been interested in molecular
   processes, which rely on volatile, error-prone, asynchronous,
   mechanisms, which can be used as a basis for decision making and
   patterning. David also investigates how signaling interactions at
   higher levels, including microbial and organismal, are used to
   coordinate complex life cycles and social systems, and under what
   conditions we observe the emergence of proto-grammars. Much of this
   work is motivated by the search for 'noisy-design' principles in
   biology and culture emerging through evolutionary dynamics that span
   hierarchical structures.

   Research projects includes work on the molecular logic of signaling
   pathways, the evolution of genome organization (redundancy, multiple
   encoding, quantization and compression), robust communication over
   networks, the evolution of distributed forms of biological information
   processing, dynamical memory systems, the logic of transmissible
   regulatory networks (such as virus life cycles) and the many ways in
   which organisms construct their environments (niche construction).
   Thinking about niche constructing niches provides us with a new
   perspective on the major evolutionary transitions.

   Many of these areas are characterized by the need to encode heritable
   information (genetic, epigenetic, auto-catalytic or linguistic) at
   distinct levels of biological organization, where selection pressures
   are often independent or in conflict. Furthermore, components are noisy
   and degrade and interactions are typically diffusively coupled. At each
   level David asks how information is acquired, stored, transmitted,
   replicated, transformed and robustly encoded.

   The big question that many are asking is what will evolutionary theory
   look like once it has become integrated with the sciences of adaptive
   information (information theory and computation), and of course, what
   will these sciences then look like?

   Krakauer was previously chair of the faculty and a resident professor
   and external professor at the Santa Fe Institute. A graduate of the
   University of London, where he went on to earn degrees in biology, and
   computer science. Dr. Krakauer received his D.Phil. in evolutionary
   theory from Oxford University in 1995. He remained at Oxford as a
   postdoctoral research fellow, and two years later was named a Wellcome
   Research Fellow in mathematical biology and lecturer at Pembroke
   College. In 1999, he accepted an appointment to the Institute for
   Advanced Study in Princeton and served as visiting professor of
   evolution at Princeton University. He moved on to the Santa Fe
   Institute as a professor three years later and was made faculty chair
   in 2009. Dr. Krakauer has been a visiting fellow at the Genomics
   Frontiers Institute at the University of Pennsylvania and a Sage Fellow
   at the Sage Center for the Study of the Mind at the University of Santa
   Barbara. In 2012 Dr. Krakauer was included in the Wired Magazine Smart
   List as one of 50 people "who will change the World."

   David Krakauer also served as the Director of the Wisconsin Institute
   for Discovery, the Co-Director of the Center for Complexity and
   Collective Computation, and was a Professor of Genetics at the
   University of Wisconsin, Madison.

   How do we, humans, understand the world: categorize and accumulate
   our knowledge, and thereby innovate idea, culture, and technologies? Is
   there any universal mechanism that governs such innovation process that
   eventually generates both social and economic wealth across different
   societies? A common conceptualization of innovation in both the
   biological and socio-economic domains sees it as an adaptive process of
   recombinant search over a space of configurational possibilities. I
   develop a mathematical framework for recombinant search in the space of
   configurational possibilities supported strongly by empirical data. The
   better we understand the mechanism of innovation the better we
   understand the mechanism of wealth creation.

   Research goals: Develop a mathematical framework for economic growth
   through innovation and tacit knowledge accumulation based strongly on
   empirical data; Understand universality in the way humans categorizes
   the world, accumulate knowledge, and innovate new technologies.

David Krakauer

   President and William H. Miller Professor of Complex Systems

   David’s research focuses on the evolutionary history of information
   processing mechanisms in biology and culture. This includes genetic,
   neural, linguistic and cultural mechanisms. The research spans multiple
   levels of organization, seeking analogous patterns and principles in
   genetics, cell biology, microbiology and in organismal behavior and
   society. At the cellular level David has been interested in molecular
   processes, which rely on volatile, error-prone, asynchronous,
   mechanisms, which can be used as a basis for decision making and
   patterning. David also investigates how signaling interactions at
   higher levels, including microbial and organismal, are used to
   coordinate complex life cycles and social systems, and under what
   conditions we observe the emergence of proto-grammars. Much of this
   work is motivated by the search for 'noisy-design' principles in
   biology and culture emerging through evolutionary dynamics that span
   hierarchical structures.

   Research projects includes work on the molecular logic of signaling
   pathways, the evolution of genome organization (redundancy, multiple
   encoding, quantization and compression), robust communication over
   networks, the evolution of distributed forms of biological information
   processing, dynamical memory systems, the logic of transmissible
   regulatory networks (such as virus life cycles) and the many ways in
   which organisms construct their environments (niche construction).
   Thinking about niche constructing niches provides us with a new
   perspective on the major evolutionary transitions.

   Many of these areas are characterized by the need to encode heritable
   information (genetic, epigenetic, auto-catalytic or linguistic) at
   distinct levels of biological organization, where selection pressures
   are often independent or in conflict. Furthermore, components are noisy
   and degrade and interactions are typically diffusively coupled. At each
   level David asks how information is acquired, stored, transmitted,
   replicated, transformed and robustly encoded.

   The big question that many are asking is what will evolutionary theory
   look like once it has become integrated with the sciences of adaptive
   information (information theory and computation), and of course, what
   will these sciences then look like?

   Krakauer was previously chair of the faculty and a resident professor
   and external professor at the Santa Fe Institute. A graduate of the
   University of London, where he went on to earn degrees in biology, and
   computer science. Dr. Krakauer received his D.Phil. in evolutionary
   theory from Oxford University in 1995. He remained at Oxford as a
   postdoctoral research fellow, and two years later was named a Wellcome
   Research Fellow in mathematical biology and lecturer at Pembroke
   College. In 1999, he accepted an appointment to the Institute for
   Advanced Study in Princeton and served as visiting professor of
   evolution at Princeton University. He moved on to the Santa Fe
   Institute as a professor three years later and was made faculty chair
   in 2009. Dr. Krakauer has been a visiting fellow at the Genomics
   Frontiers Institute at the University of Pennsylvania and a Sage Fellow
   at the Sage Center for the Study of the Mind at the University of Santa
   Barbara. In 2012 Dr. Krakauer was included in the Wired Magazine Smart
   List as one of 50 people "who will change the World."

   David Krakauer also served as the Director of the Wisconsin Institute
   for Discovery, the Co-Director of the Center for Complexity and
   Collective Computation, and was a Professor of Genetics at the
   University of Wisconsin, Madison.
