   retail (Former Employee) –  Pretoria, Gauteng – 18 August 2019
   It's good startup to a student to work on this company me I am looking
   for upgrade because it's no longer reach my cost of life due to
   financial. Because in life you need to have references from companies
   for you to be able to find a job and be a hard worker so that company
   gave me a good experience, how to heddle different types of people so
   that why am good at communicating

   Depending on the kind of people you are working with on the shift,it
   can be a great day. Learned to work calmly under pressure and be
   proactive
   crew member (Current Employee) –  Mayville Pretoria – 13 August 2019
   It is a great company to work for but sometimes the environment can be
   extremely stressful because of different factors. It's a fast paced
   environment and pushes you to work under pressure. It's a better
   environment when you are working as a team.

   Fun at work
   Teller/Cashier (Former Employee) –  Parow, Western Cape – 12 August
   2019
   manage cash register
   attend to client's orders
   build rapport
   weekdays it's manageable but weekends there is a lot of food traffic
   queue and orders which needs undivided attention but a lot of focus.
   Once the cash register makes an inviting comeback (open/closing each
   time) that lets you know that things are just starting to take off.
   Hardest part - is to work doubleshift due to one of the staff to
   replace you when your shift ends, has not pitched up for work - you
   have to arrange transport on the last minute.
   Hours are not steady
   Enjoy - customer service / interact with customers
   Pros
   free lunch
   Cons
   double shift

   flexi (Former Employee) –  Brackenfell, Western Cape – 23 July 2019
   I really had a great experience at Mc Donalds. I was always happy to be
   there and the only thing that stood out for me was team work. We were
   working very hard to make sure that we serve the best for customers
   even though there were tough times when some staff members do not
   co-operate. The management was hands on and they were doing their best
   to make sure that everyone is happy and satisfied.

   It's good startup to a student to work on this company me I am looking
   for upgrade because it's no longer reach my cost of life due to
   financial. Because in life you need to have references from companies
   for you to be able to find a job and be a hard worker so that company
   gave me a good experience, how to heddle different types of people so
   that why am good at communicating

   Depending on the kind of people you are working with on the shift,it
   can be a great day. Learned to work calmly under pressure and be
   proactive
   crew member (Current Employee) –  Mayville Pretoria – 13 August 2019
   It is a great company to work for but sometimes the environment can be
   extremely stressful because of different factors. It's a fast paced
   environment and pushes you to work under pressure. It's a better
   environment when you are working as a team.

   Fun at work
   Teller/Cashier (Former Employee) –  Parow, Western Cape – 12 August
   2019
   manage cash register
   attend to client's orders
   build rapport
   weekdays it's manageable but weekends there is a lot of food traffic
   queue and orders which needs undivided attention but a lot of focus.
   Once the cash register makes an inviting comeback (open/closing each
   time) that lets you know that things are just starting to take off.
   Hardest part - is to work doubleshift due to one of the staff to
   replace you when your shift ends, has not pitched up for work - you
   have to arrange transport on the last minute.
   Hours are not steady
   Enjoy - customer service / interact with customers
   Pros
   free lunch
   Cons
   double shift

   fun workplace
   flexi (Former Employee) –  Brackenfell, Western Cape – 23 July 2019
   I really had a great experience at Mc Donalds. I was always happy to be
   there and the only thing that stood out for me was team work. We were
   working very hard to make sure that we serve the best for customers
   even though there were tough times when some staff members do not
   co-operate. The management was hands on and they were doing their best
   to make sure that everyone is happy and satisfied.
