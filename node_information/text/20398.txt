Abstract

   :
   Recommender systems have gained a lot of popularity due to their large
   adoption in various industries such as entertainment and tourism.
   Numerous research efforts have focused on formulating and advancing
   state-of-the-art of systems that recommend the right set of items to
   the right person. However, these recommender systems are hard to
   compare since the published evaluation results are computed on diverse
   datasets and obtained using different methodologies. In this paper, we
   researched and prototyped an offline evaluation framework called
   Sequeval that is designed to evaluate recommender systems capable of
   suggesting sequences of items. We provide a mathematical definition of
   such sequence-based recommenders, a methodology for performing their
   evaluation, and the implementation details of eight metrics. We report
   the lessons learned using this framework for assessing the performance
   of four baselines and two recommender systems based on Conditional
   Random Fields (CRF) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), considering
   two different datasets. Sequeval is publicly available and it aims to
   become a focal point for researchers and practitioners when
   experimenting with sequence-based recommender systems, providing
   comparable and objective evaluation results.

1. Introduction

   Recommender Systems (RSs) are software tools capable of suggesting
   items to users according to their preferences [1]. A popular
   recommendation technique, called Collaborative Filtering (CF), consists
   of learning users’ preferences by only relying on their interactions
   with the items available in a catalog. For example, using a
   nearest-neighbor search (memory-based CF) or a machine learning model
   (model-based CF), it is possible to select the most relevant items for
   each user who has interacted enough with the system [2]. An alternative
   approach to this problem is represented by content-based RSs, which can
   generate suggestions by matching users’ profiles with the features of
   the items [3,4]. Another family of recommendation methods proposed in
   the literature is represented by hybrid algorithms, capable of
   combining both collaborative and content-based filtering for mitigating
   the individual weaknesses of the previous techniques [5].
   While these recommendation approaches usually guarantee interesting
   results in traditional domains, such as movie recommendation, they are
   not capable of capturing the temporal evolution of users’
   preferences [6]. For example, different authors [7,8,9] argue that
   movies watched recently provide more useful information about a certain
   user than those she consumed in a distant past. It is, in fact,
   reasonable to assume that a recent item may have a high influence on
   the choice of the next one.
   Therefore, a RS that exploits sequential data for predicting the sole
   next item that will be consumed by a user can be defined as sequential
   recommender [10]. Several works related to sequential recommenders are
   available in the literature. For example, Zhou et al. [11] exploited a
   sequential pattern mining algorithm for recommending which page to
   visit next in a website, while Rendle et al. [8] relied on Markov
   chains for suggesting products considering previous purchases.
   Recently, He et al. [9] designed a recommender system capable of
   modeling how users’ interests evolve over time. While all these methods
   usually consider user preferences observed during the training phase as
   sequences, no temporal ordering is available at recommendation time, as
   only one item, or a list of items ranked by relevance, is suggested to
   users. Because of the popularity of CF techniques, most of sequential
   recommenders are based on such approaches [12], but in principle it is
   also possible to design systems capable of analyzing sequences
   according to content-based methods.
   In general, even if the problem of creating a sequence of words
   starting from an initial one is a well-known task inside the natural
   language processing community [13], the idea of creating personalized
   sequences of items is less widespread in the context of RSs [14]. For
   this reason, it would be interesting to be able to exploit the temporal
   ordering not only during the training phase but also for generating
   sequences of recommended items, such as in the task of language
   modeling. Some solutions to this problem have already been proposed in
   industry, and also few researchers have discussed how to automatically
   construct music playlists [15] or suggest sequences of
   points-of-interest to tourists [16] starting from seed items.
   However, early studies conducted in this field lack of a common
   definition of the problem that they are trying to address. For example,
   session-based RSs only consider the last session of the current
   user [17], while sequence-aware recommenders also exploit the history
   of past sessions [12] and they can be considered equivalent to
   sequential recommenders. Furthermore, it is not clear if item
   repetitions are allowed in the suggestions or not.
   In this work, we argue that it is possible to consider RSs capable of
   creating personalized sequences of an arbitrary length as a
   generalization of a sequential recommender because the latter is only
   able of creating sequences of length one. In contrast to traditional
   RSs that usually create lists of items ranked by relevance, in the
   following we will define a recommender that exploits a temporal
   dimension both in the training and in the generation phase as a
   sequence-based recommender, as it observes and suggests sequences of
   items meant be consumed in a particular order.
   On the other side, several evaluation protocols and metrics for
   analyzing novel RSs via offline experiments are available, to capture
   the different aspects of the recommendation algorithm [18]. However,
   the lack of a standardized way of performing such in vitro experiments
   leads to results that are often incomparable [19]. To the best of our
   knowledge, no evaluation framework for sequence-based RSs has already
   been proposed. The motivating hypothesis of this study is that in the
   context of sequence-based RSs, traditional evaluation metrics need to
   be computed at the level of sequences instead of the level of users.
   In our view, an evaluation framework consists of a methodology for
   performing an experimental comparison, a set of metrics, and a software
   tool that implements them. Therefore, the main aim of this work is to
   address the following research questions and to introduce an offline
   evaluation framework for sequence-based RSs that we called Sequeval.

   RQ1
          What is the formal definition of a sequence-based recommender
          system?

   RQ2
          How already established metrics can be extended and adapted for
          evaluating a sequence-based recommender system?

   RQ3
          Against which baselines a sequence-based recommender system can
          be compared?

   Because our evaluation approach is agnostic with respect to the
   implementation details of the algorithms under analysis, it can be
   successfully exploited to also assess the performance of systems based
   on alternative recommendation methods [20] or dealing with
   unconventional categories of items, for example 3D movies [21] or
   cultural digital contents [22], especially if they are supposed to be
   consumed by users in a sequential order.
   Besides, by openly releasing a Python implementation of Sequeval, we
   aim to encourage the use of the proposed framework as an attempt to
   standardize the evaluation of sequence-based RSs, mitigating the
   comparability problem in RSs research.
   The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we
   review related works; in Section 3 we present the mathematical
   definition of a sequence-based recommender system; in Section 4 we
   introduce Sequeval by describing its evaluation protocol, metrics, and
   implementation details; in Section 5 we perform an empirical analysis
   of the framework with two different datasets. Finally, in Section 6, we
   formulate our conclusions and we outline future works.

2. Related Work

   In this section, we distinguish among works related to RSs capable of
   exploiting sequences of items (Section 2.1), evaluation protocols and
   metrics for performing an offline comparison (Section 2.2), and their
   experimental reproducibility (Section 2.3).

2.1. Sequential Recommenders

   Several examples of sequential recommenders are available in the
   literature [12]. Zhou et al. [11] proposed a web recommender system
   based on a sequential pattern mining algorithm. The recommender is
   trained with the access logs of a website and its goal is to predict
   the pages that are likely to be visited by a certain user, given her
   previously visited pages. The authors proposed to store the model in a
   tree-like structure, relying on a technique originally designed for
   matching substrings over a finite alphabet of characters. A
   recommendation is then created by matching the sequence of pages
   already visited by the target user with the sequences previously
   analyzed by the algorithm.
   In the context of market basket analysis, it is also possible to
   exploit the sequence of previous transactions to predict what a
   customer is going to buy next [23]. Rendle et al. [8] proposed a method
   based on personalized transition graphs over Markov chains, while Wang
   et al. [10] designed a recommender capable of modeling both the
   sequential information from previous purchases and the overall
   preferences by a hybrid representation.
   Bellogín and Sánchez [24] proposed a similarity metric designed to
   compare users in the context of CF RSs. This metric takes into account
   the temporal sequence of users’ ratings to identify common behaviors.
   The authors argue that it is possible to consider a sequence of items
   as a string, where each character represents an item, and compare them
   using the longest common subsequence algorithm [25].
   Recently, He et al. [9] introduced the concept of translation-based
   recommendation. While a traditional RS only considers the pairwise
   interactions between items and users, their idea is to model a
   third-order relationship among a user, the items she interacted with in
   the past, and the item she is going to visit next. Each user can be
   represented as a vector in a transition space: given the current item,
   it is possible to compute where the next one will be located. At
   recommendation time, it is possible to generate a list of suggested
   items by relying on a nearest-neighbor search.
   On the other hand, the task of generating recommendations of sequences
   was already discussed and presented in a seminal work by Herlocker et
   al. [14]. The authors suggested that it would be intriguing to be able
   to suggest, in the music domain, not only the songs that will be
   probably liked by a certain user, but also a playlist of songs that is
   globally pleasing. Moreover, they also proposed to apply this
   recommendation methodology in the context of scientific literature,
   where it is necessary to read a sequence of articles to become familiar
   with a certain topic of interest.
   The former problem was later addressed by Chen et al. [15], who
   designed and implemented a recommender system capable of generating
   personalized playlists by modeling them as Markov chains. Their
   algorithm is capable of learning, from a set of training playlists, how
   to represent each song as a point in a latent space. Then, starting
   from a seed song, it is possible to create a playlist of an arbitrary
   length by repeatedly sampling the transition probabilities between
   adjacent songs. The resulting playlist is personalized because of the
   chosen seed. Furthermore, each user can influence the generation
   process by specifying some parameters: for example, a user might be
   more interested in popular songs, while another one in songs that are
   strictly related to the given seed.
   Another typical application for a sequence-based recommender is the
   next point-of-interest (POI) prediction problem [12]. Given some
   training sequences of previously liked geographical locations, this
   task consists of predicting a sequence of venues that is pleasing for a
   given user. Feng et al. [16] proposed an algorithm capable of creating
   sequences of POIs that have not been already visited. The authors
   developed a Metric Embedding algorithm that captures both the
   sequential information and individual preference. Such metric is then
   exploited to create a Markov chain model capable of representing the
   transition probabilities between a given POI and the next one. The key
   features that are implicitly considered in the embedding creation phase
   are the conceptual similarity and the geographical distance of the
   analyzed venues.
   A different line of research is represented by recommenders capable of
   analyzing sequences of multimedia objects. For example, Albanese et
   al. [26] proposed a hybrid recommender system for retrieving multimedia
   content based on the theory of social choice and capable of exploiting,
   among other signals, the implicit browsing preferences of its users.
   Later, the authors of [27] introduced a multimedia recommendation
   algorithm capable of combining semantic descriptors and usage patterns.
   The proposed approach can manage different media types and it enables
   users to explore several multimedia channels at the same time. Possible
   applications of such technologies are represented by browsing tools for
   virtual museums [28] and recommenders of cultural heritage sites [29].
   Differently from the previously reported works, our main aim is not to
   propose a novel recommendation algorithm, but a general method to
   standardize how the sequences of recommended items are generated and
   evaluated in an offline setting.

2.2. Offline Evaluation

   To the best of our knowledge, the first survey that deals with the
   problem of evaluating a recommender system was conducted by Herlocker
   et al. [14]. In their work, the authors discuss when it is appropriate
   to perform an offline evaluation and when it is necessary to carry on
   an online, or in vivo, experiment. The former is particularly useful to
   select a small set of potentially good candidates that will be further
   compared in a real scenario. However, to be complete and trustworthy,
   such a evaluation needs to rely on a set of well-defined metrics, that
   should be able to capture all characteristics of the recommended items.
   They review several accuracy metrics usually exploited by different
   authors and they classify them into three categories: predictive
   accuracy metrics, classification accuracy metrics, and rank accuracy
   metrics. These groups are strictly related to the purpose of the
   recommender system: predicting a rating for each user-item pair,
   identifying an item as appropriate or not for a user, and creating an
   ordered list of recommended items for a user. Furthermore, the authors
   suggest that it is necessary to avoid relying only on accuracy to draw
   a reliable conclusion: for this reason, they also review and discuss
   the metrics of coverage, learning rate, novelty, serendipity, and
   confidence.
   Gunawardana and Shani [18] proposed a set of general guidelines for
   designing experiments with the purpose of evaluating RSs. Such
   experiments can be classified as offline trails, user studies, or
   online analysis that involve a live system. Several properties of a
   recommender system can be evaluated: for example, the most common ones
   are user preference, prediction accuracy, coverage, and utility. The
   authors argue that the possibility of measuring these properties is
   strongly influenced by the kind of study and, in the most extreme
   scenario, some of them cannot be obtained. For example, it is very
   difficult to measure users’ preference in an offline setting.
   For each property, different commonly exploited metrics are presented
   and discussed. Even if the main metrics proposed for evaluating the
   most popular properties are widely known and understood, usually there
   is little agreement about the most appropriate metrics for
   characterizing the least common properties. For example, several
   definitions, and several metrics, related to the property of utility
   are available in the literature. The authors also point out that a key
   decision of offline experiment design is the splitting protocol because
   this choice will greatly influence the final outcome of the measures.

2.3. Experimental Reproducibility

   Different authors analyzed the experimental reproducibility of offline
   evaluations. For example, Jannach et al. [19] compared several
   recommendation algorithms in an offline experiment, analyzing their
   performance by relying on a comprehensive evaluation framework. The
   authors considered different splitting protocols and metrics, designed
   to characterize both the accuracy, in terms of rating and ranking, and
   the coverage of the suggested items. The results of the experimental
   trails suggest that some common algorithms, despite their high
   accuracy, tend to only recommend popular items that are probably not
   very interesting for the users of a real system. This problem is
   related to the popularity biases introduced by the offline evaluation
   protocol: for this reason, it is not advisable to compare different
   algorithms by relying only on measures related to their accuracy. In
   addition, different splitting protocols produce significantly different
   and non-comparable outcomes.
   Bellogín et al. [30] proposed an evaluation framework designed
   following the methodologies of the Information Retrieval (IR) field.
   They suggest that the evaluation procedures available in IR are
   widespread: for this reason, they could be successfully exploited by
   the RS community to create a shared evaluation protocol based on
   ranking, as this setting is more similar to the one of a live system.
   Unfortunately, three different decisions need to be taken to achieve
   this goal.
   The items considered for the evaluation could be all items available in
   the dataset, or only the items available in the test set. The
   non-relevant items for a certain user could be represented by all items
   in the test set not rated by that user, or by a subset of it with a
   fixed size. Finally, the global metric could be computed by averaging
   its value on all users, or on all ratings available in the test set.
   Different design choices will result in different evaluation protocols
   and results. The authors also identify two sources of biases in offline
   evaluations protocols: the sparsity bias and the popularity bias.
   Several software tools are available with the purpose of simplifying
   the process of comparing the performance of recommendation algorithms.
   They typically include some evaluation protocols and a reference
   implementation of well-known techniques. Said and Bellogín [31]
   compared several of these tools to check if their results are
   consistent. They discovered that the values obtained with the same
   dataset and algorithm may vary significantly among different
   frameworks. For this reason, it is not feasible to directly compare the
   scores reported by these tools, because they are obtained relying on
   several protocols. The discrepancies reported by the authors are mainly
   caused by the data splitting protocol, the strategy used to generate
   the candidate items, and the implementation choices related to the
   evaluation metrics.

3. Sequence-Based Recommender Systems

   Before analyzing the evaluation framework, we introduce the problem of
   recommending sequences and we provide an answer to RQ1. In a
   traditional recommender system, users express positive or negative
   preferences about a certain item. An item may be, for example, a
   product, a song, or a place. In contrast, we assume that when a user
   consumes or interacts with an item, she expresses an implicit rating
   about it. This assumption in the literature goes under the name of
   implicit feedback [14]. Because we are also considering the temporal
   dimension to build the sequences, each rating is associated with a
   timestamp that represents the point in time when it was recorded.
   Definition 1.
   Given the space of items
   [MATH: <semantics> <mi mathvariant="script">I</mi> </semantics> :MATH]
   , the space of users
   [MATH: <semantics> <mi mathvariant="script">U</mi> </semantics> :MATH]
   , the space of timestamps
   [MATH: <semantics> <mi mathvariant="script">T</mi> </semantics> :MATH]
   , a rating
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi mathvariant="bold">r</mi> <mo>∈</mo> <mi
   mathvariant="script">R</mi> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   is a tuple
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi mathvariant="bold">r</mi> <mo>=</mo>
   <mo>(</mo> <mi>ι</mi> <mo>,</mo> <mi>υ</mi> <mo>,</mo> <mi>τ</mi>
   <mo>)</mo> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   , where
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi>ι</mi> <mo>∈</mo> <mi
   mathvariant="script">I</mi> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   is the item for which the user
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi>υ</mi> <mo>∈</mo> <mi
   mathvariant="script">U</mi> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   expressed a positive preference at the timestamp
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi>τ</mi> <mo>∈</mo> <mi
   mathvariant="script">T</mi> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   .
   By relying on the set of ratings
   [MATH: <semantics> <mi mathvariant="script">R</mi> </semantics> :MATH]
   available in the system, it is possible to construct the sequences that
   will be used to train and to evaluate the recommender. Each sequence
   only includes the ratings expressed by a single user. On the other
   hand, each user may produce several sequences.
   The concept of sequence is similar to the concept of session in a
   traditional web interaction: if two ratings are distant in time more
   than an interval
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi>δ</mi> <mi>τ</mi> </mrow> </semantics>
   :MATH]
   , then they belong to different sequences. Some ratings may be isolated
   and, for this reason, not part of any sequence. The most appropriate
   value for
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi>δ</mi> <mi>τ</mi> </mrow> </semantics>
   :MATH]
   depends on the domain: for example, in the POI recommendation scenario,
   it could be considered of a few hours as reported in [16].
   Definition 2.
   A sequence
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi mathvariant="bold">s</mi> <mo>∈</mo> <mi
   mathvariant="script">S</mi> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]

   A sequence-based recommender is an RS capable of suggesting a
   personalized sequence that is built starting from a seed rating
   [MATH: <semantics> <msub> <mi mathvariant="bold">r</mi> <mn>0</mn>
   </msub> </semantics> :MATH]
   , considering the example sequences already available in the system and
   the specific behavior of a certain user. The seed rating is
   characterized by a seed item
   [MATH: <semantics> <msub> <mi>ι</mi> <mn>0</mn> </msub> </semantics>
   :MATH]
   , a target user
   [MATH: <semantics> <mi>υ</mi> </semantics> :MATH]
   , and an initial timestamp
   [MATH: <semantics> <msub> <mi>τ</mi> <mn>0</mn> </msub> </semantics>
   :MATH]
   . The seed item can be represented by any item that belongs to the
   catalog, but, more in general, it is a point in the space of items
   [MATH: <semantics> <mi mathvariant="script">I</mi> </semantics> :MATH]
   . For example, in the music domain, it could identify not only a
   particular song, but also an artist, a genre, or a mood. The target
   user is the user to whom the sequence is recommended, while the initial
   timestamp represents the point in time in which the recommendation is
   created. The generated sequence is of a fixed length and it contains
   exactly k ratings. Please note that if
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi>k</mi> <mo>=</mo> <mn>1</mn> </mrow>
   </semantics> :MATH]

   Thus, a sequence-based recommender system typically works by learning
   from a set of sequences

   <mi>t</mi> <mi>r</mi> <mi>a</mi> <mi>i</mi> <mi>n</mi> <mi>i</mi>

   the conditional probability of the next rating
   [MATH: <semantics> <msub> <mi mathvariant="bold">r</mi> <mi>k</mi>
   </msub> </semantics> :MATH]
   to the sequence of previous ones

   <mo>−</mo> <mn>1</mn> </mrow> </msub> <mo>〉</mo> </mrow> </semantics>
   :MATH]
   , i.e., the factors of the right-hand side of Equation (2). Sampling
   sequences directly from Equation (2) would require computing the
   probabilities of all the
   [MATH: <semantics> <msup> <mrow> <mo>|</mo> <mi>I</mi> <mo>|</mo>
   </mrow> <mi>k</mi> </msup> </semantics> :MATH]
   possible sequences, where
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mo>|</mo> <mi>I</mi> <mo>|</mo> </mrow>
   </semantics> :MATH]
   is the size of the vocabulary of items and k is the length of the
   sequences. Since this becomes easily computationally unfeasible, we opt
   for a greedy approach, in which at each step we sample the next most
   likely item. A sampling function
   [MATH: <semantics> <mi>ρ</mi> </semantics> :MATH]
   is defined to select a particular next rating from the previous ones at
   each step:
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <msub> <mover accent="true"> <mi
   mathvariant="bold">r</mi> <mo>^</mo> </mover> <mi>k</mi> </msub>

   </mrow> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   (4)
   A trivial example of
   [MATH: <semantics> <mi>ρ</mi> </semantics> :MATH]
   is the
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi>a</mi> <mi>r</mi> <mi>g</mi> <mi>m</mi>
   <mi>a</mi> <mi>x</mi> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   function, which simply selects the most probable next rating. In the
   following, we will assume that
   [MATH: <semantics> <mi>ρ</mi> </semantics> :MATH]
   is implemented by a weighted random sampling function.
   Algorithm 2 formalizes the procedure for generating a personalized
   sequence, given a seed rating
   [MATH: <semantics> <msub> <mi mathvariant="bold">r</mi> <mn>0</mn>
   </msub> </semantics> :MATH]
   , and a length k, i.e., it describes the sampling function
   [MATH: <semantics> <mi>σ</mi> </semantics> :MATH]
   . For k times, the next rating of the recommended sequence is generated
   using the function
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi>p</mi> <mi>r</mi> <mi>e</mi> <mi>d</mi>
   <mi>i</mi> <mi>c</mi> <mi>t</mi> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   . The function
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi>p</mi> <mi>r</mi> <mi>e</mi> <mi>d</mi>
   <mi>i</mi> <mi>c</mi> <mi>t</mi> <mo>:</mo> <mi
   mathvariant="script">S</mi> <mo>→</mo> <mi mathvariant="script">R</mi>
   </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   implements the sampling function
   [MATH: <semantics> <mi>ρ</mi> </semantics> :MATH]
   and it returns the most probable next rating for the current input
   sequence. In practice, the sequence-based recommender system can
   estimate the probability that the next rating of the current sequence
   will include a particular item at a certain timestamp.
   Please note that the greedy procedure described in Algorithm 2 is not
   the only way to create samples of sequences, and thus, the user of the
   evaluation framework or the designer of the recommendation method are
   free to define other ways and strategies for that end.

   To compute some metrics that are part of the evaluation framework, it
   is necessary to know the number of items that are associated with a
   certain sequence. For this reason, we define the set
   [MATH: <semantics> <msub> <mi mathvariant="script">I</mi> <mi
   mathvariant="bold">s</mi> </msub> </semantics> :MATH]
   as the set of items that are part of the sequence
   [MATH: <semantics> <mi mathvariant="bold">s</mi> </semantics> :MATH]
   , and the set
   [MATH: <semantics> <msub> <mi mathvariant="script">R</mi> <mi
   mathvariant="bold">s</mi> </msub> </semantics> :MATH]
   as the set of ratings that are part of the sequence
   [MATH: <semantics> <mi mathvariant="bold">s</mi> </semantics> :MATH]
   . Therefore,
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mrow> <mo>|</mo> </mrow> <msub> <mi
   mathvariant="script">I</mi> <mi mathvariant="bold">s</mi> </msub>
   <mrow> <mo>|</mo> </mrow> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   is the number of distinct items available in
   [MATH: <semantics> <mi mathvariant="bold">s</mi> </semantics> :MATH]
   , while
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mrow> <mo>|</mo> </mrow> <msub> <mi
   mathvariant="script">R</mi> <mi mathvariant="bold">s</mi> </msub>
   <mrow> <mo>|</mo> </mrow> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   represents the length of
   [MATH: <semantics> <mi mathvariant="bold">s</mi> </semantics> :MATH]
   , i.e., the number of ratings available in
   [MATH: <semantics> <mi mathvariant="bold">s</mi> </semantics> :MATH]
   .
   For instance, we can suppose that the set of ratings
   [MATH: <semantics> <mi mathvariant="script">R</mi> </semantics> :MATH]
   is equal to
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mo>{</mo> <mrow> <mo>(</mo> <msub>

4. Sequeval

   Comparing the performance of several recommenders with an experiment
   that involves a live system is not always feasible or appropriate. For
   this reason, it is necessary to first perform a preliminary evaluation
   in an offline scenario [18]. In such a setting, we can assess the
   performance of the algorithms by comparing with baselines,
   understanding the strengths and weaknesses of those, and thus avoiding
   affecting real users negatively in their experience with the system.
   The results of an offline experiment will be less trustworthy than the
   ones obtained from an online study because there was no real
   interaction with the system [32], but they are usually exploited as the
   first stage in the preparation of the in vivo experimentation.
   Even if an offline study is only the first step in the process of
   evaluating a recommender, it is necessary to rely on a solid evaluation
   protocol and a set of well-defined metrics that are able to capture all
   the characteristics of the analyzed algorithm [33]. In the following,
   we will introduce an offline evaluation framework for sequence-based
   RSs that we called Sequeval.
   Our framework is based on the concept of sequence as formalized in
   Section 3. First, an initial dataset is transformed into a set of
   sequences following Algorithm 1. Then, the sequences are split between
   training and test sets. At this point, one or more external
   recommenders are plugged into the framework: they are exposed to the
   training sequences and they are asked to create suggested sequences
   starting from the same seeds of the test ones. A possible strategy for
   suggesting additional sequences is described in Algorithm 2, but the
   user can define other approaches. Finally, considering the
   recommendations available, the framework can compute different
   evaluation metrics.
   In details, Sequeval is made of an evaluation protocol, presented in
   Section 4.1, a set of evaluation metrics, described in Section 4.2, and
   a software implementation that is introduced in Section 4.3.

4.1. Evaluation Protocol

   One of the first problems that an evaluation framework should consider
   is how to split the dataset between the training set and the test set.
   This task is not trivial, as it will deeply influence the outcome of
   the experimentation [31]. Since we are dealing with sequences, we need
   to split the set of sequences
   [MATH: <semantics> <mi mathvariant="script">S</mi> </semantics> :MATH]
   in a training and test set such that
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi mathvariant="script">S</mi> <mo>=</mo>
   <msub> <mi mathvariant="script">S</mi> <mrow> <mi>t</mi> <mi>r</mi>
   <mi>a</mi> <mi>i</mi> <mi>n</mi> <mi>i</mi> <mi>n</mi> <mi>g</mi>
   </mrow> </msub> <mo>∪</mo> <msub> <mi mathvariant="script">S</mi>
   <mrow> <mi>t</mi> <mi>e</mi> <mi>s</mi> <mi>t</mi> </mrow> </msub>
   </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   .
   Several solutions to this problem are possible: a simple but effective
   one is to perform the splitting by randomly assigning sequences to
   these sets according to a certain ratio, typically the
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mn>80</mn> <mo>%</mo> </mrow> </semantics>
   :MATH]
   for training and the
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mn>20</mn> <mo>%</mo> </mrow> </semantics>
   :MATH]
   for testing. If the number of sequences available is limited, it is
   necessary to perform a cross-validation. Another possibility is to
   identify an appropriate point in time and to consider all the sequences
   created before it as part of the training set, and after it as part of
   the test set. This protocol simulates the behavior of a recommender
   introduced at that point in time and it avoids too optimistic results
   caused by the knowledge of future events [34]. The latter solution can
   be considered the most reliable one, but if we do not have any temporal
   information because the sequences have already been created, it is
   necessary to adopt a random protocol.
   More in general, it is impossible to identify a splitting method that
   is appropriate for every experiment, as it depends on the domain and on
   the dataset available. For this reason, Sequeval does not impose the
   adoption of a particular splitting protocol, but the experimenter can
   choose the most appropriate one.
   To compute the metrics that are part of the evaluation framework, the
   sequence-based recommender is trained with all the sequences
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi mathvariant="bold">s</mi> <mo>∈</mo>
   <msub> <mi mathvariant="script">S</mi> <mrow> <mi>t</mi> <mi>r</mi>
   <mi>a</mi> <mi>i</mi> <mi>n</mi> <mi>i</mi> <mi>n</mi> <mi>g</mi>
   </mrow> </msub> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   . Then, for each test sequence
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi mathvariant="bold">s</mi> <mo>∈</mo>
   <msub> <mi mathvariant="script">S</mi> <mrow> <mi>t</mi> <mi>e</mi>
   <mi>s</mi> <mi>t</mi> </mrow> </msub> <mo>:</mo> <mi
   mathvariant="bold">s</mi> <mo>=</mo> <mrow> <mo>〈</mo> <msub> <mi
   mathvariant="bold">r</mi> <mn>1</mn> </msub> <mo>,</mo> <msub> <mi
   mathvariant="bold">r</mi> <mn>2</mn> </msub> <mo>,</mo> <mo>…</mo>
   <mo>,</mo> <msub> <mi mathvariant="bold">r</mi> <mi>n</mi> </msub>
   <mo>〉</mo> </mrow> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   , we predict a recommended sequence
   [MATH: <semantics> <mover> <mi mathvariant="bold">s</mi> <mo>¯</mo>
   </mover> </semantics> :MATH]
   of length k using
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <msub> <mi mathvariant="bold">r</mi>
   <mn>1</mn> </msub> <mo>=</mo> <mrow> <mo>(</mo> <msub> <mi>ι</mi>
   <mn>1</mn> </msub> <mo>,</mo> <mi>υ</mi> <mo>,</mo> <msub> <mi>τ</mi>
   <mn>1</mn> </msub> <mo>)</mo> </mrow> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   as seed rating, i.e.,
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mover> <mi mathvariant="bold">s</mi>
   <mo>¯</mo> </mover> <mo>=</mo> <mi>sequence</mi> <mrow> <mo>(</mo>
   <msub> <mi mathvariant="bold">r</mi> <mn>1</mn> </msub> <mo>,</mo>
   <mi>k</mi> <mo>)</mo> </mrow> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   . Therefore,
   [MATH: <semantics> <mover> <mi mathvariant="bold">s</mi> <mo>¯</mo>
   </mover> </semantics> :MATH]
   is a sequence suggested by the recommender, for the same user and
   starting from the same item of
   [MATH: <semantics> <mi mathvariant="bold">s</mi> </semantics> :MATH]
   . We also define
   [MATH: <semantics> <msup> <mi mathvariant="bold">s</mi> <mo>′</mo>
   </msup> </semantics> :MATH]
   as the reference sequence, i.e.,
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <msup> <mi mathvariant="bold">s</mi>
   <mo>′</mo> </msup> <mo>=</mo> <mrow> <mo>〈</mo> <msub> <mi
   mathvariant="bold">r</mi> <mn>2</mn> </msub> <mo>,</mo> <msub> <mi
   mathvariant="bold">r</mi> <mn>3</mn> </msub> <mo>,</mo> <mo>…</mo>
   <mo>,</mo> <msub> <mi mathvariant="bold">r</mi> <mi>n</mi> </msub>
   <mo>〉</mo> </mrow> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   or
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <msup> <mi mathvariant="bold">s</mi>
   <mo>′</mo> </msup> <mo>=</mo> <mi mathvariant="bold">s</mi> <mo>−</mo>
   <mrow> <mo>〈</mo> <msub> <mi mathvariant="bold">r</mi> <mn>1</mn>
   </msub> <mo>〉</mo> </mrow> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   . The reference sequence is equal to the original sequence, but the
   first rating is omitted, as it was already exploited for creating the
   recommended sequence. This procedure is graphically illustrated in
   Figure 1.

4.2. Evaluation Metrics

   The second component of Sequeval is a set of eight metrics that we
   present in the following. In order to address RQ2, we include in such
   set not only classic metrics such as coverage and precision but also
   less widespread ones such as novelty, diversity, and serendipity.
   Furthermore, we introduce the metric of perplexity, as it is explicitly
   designed for characterizing sequences [35]. In contrast, we decided to
   avoid measuring recall because it is clear that the number of
   recommended items is often likely to be much lower than the total
   number of relevant items.

4.2.1. Coverage

   In general, the coverage of a recommender is a measure that captures
   the number of items in the catalog over which the system can make
   suggestions [18]. For example, in an online store scenario, it could
   represent the percentage of products that are recommended to users in a
   certain period of time. An algorithm with a higher coverage is
   generally considered more useful because it better helps users to
   explore the catalog.
   We generate a set of recommended sequences considering as seed the
   first rating of all sequences in the test set
   [MATH: <semantics> <msub> <mi mathvariant="script">S</mi> <mrow>
   <mi>t</mi> <mi>e</mi> <mi>s</mi> <mi>t</mi> </mrow> </msub>
   </semantics> :MATH]
   for a recommender that suggests sequences of length k. Afterward, we
   compute the distinct number of items available in the sequences created
   and we divide the result by the cardinality of the set
   [MATH: <semantics> <mi mathvariant="script">I</mi> </semantics> :MATH]
   .
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi>coverage</mi> <mrow> <mo>(</mo>
   <mi>k</mi> <mo>)</mo> </mrow> <mo>=</mo> <mfrac> <mrow> <mrow>
   <mo>|</mo> </mrow> <msub> <mo>⋃</mo> <mrow> <mi
   mathvariant="bold">s</mi> <mo>∈</mo> <msub> <mi
   mathvariant="script">S</mi> <mrow> <mi>t</mi> <mi>e</mi> <mi>s</mi>
   <mi>t</mi> </mrow> </msub> </mrow> </msub> <msub> <mi
   mathvariant="script">I</mi> <mrow> <mi>sequence</mi> <mo>(</mo> <msub>
   <mi mathvariant="bold">r</mi> <mn>1</mn> </msub> <mo>,</mo> <mi>k</mi>
   <mo>)</mo> </mrow> </msub> <mrow> <mo>|</mo> </mrow> </mrow> <mrow>
   <mo>|</mo> <mi mathvariant="script">I</mi> <mo>|</mo> </mrow> </mfrac>
   </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   (5)
   This metric expresses the percentage of items that the sequence-based
   recommender can suggest when generating sequences similar to the ones
   available in the test set and it is strictly related to its
   cardinality. This approach is similar to the metric of prediction
   coverage described by Herlocker et al. [14].

4.2.2. Precision

   Precision is a widespread metric in the context of IR evaluation [36]
   and it represents the fraction of retrieved documents that are
   relevant. For a traditional recommender system, precision measures the
   fraction of recommended items that are relevant for a certain
   user [37]. If we consider a sequence-based recommender, it is necessary
   to compute this metric for each sequence
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi mathvariant="bold">s</mi> <mo>∈</mo>
   <msub> <mi mathvariant="script">S</mi> <mrow> <mi>t</mi> <mi>e</mi>
   <mi>s</mi> <mi>t</mi> </mrow> </msub> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   , instead of each user.

   </msup> </semantics> :MATH]
   . This is an extension to the traditional definition of precision that
   also considers the fact that an item may appear multiple times inside a
   sequence.
   The number of relevant items is divided by the minimum number between
   the length of the reference sequence
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mrow> <mo>|</mo> </mrow> <msub> <mi

   and the length of the recommended sequence k. We decided to adopt this
   solution to avoid penalizing an algorithm that is evaluated considering
   reference sequences shorter than the recommended sequences.

4.2.3. nDPM

   The Normalized Distance-based Performance Metric (nDPM) was originally
   proposed by Yao in the context of information retrieval [38]. The
   intuition of the author is that in order to compare a system ranking
   with a reference user ranking, it is necessary to consider all the
   possible pairs of items available in the system ranking: they can be
   agreeing, contradictory, or compatible with respect to the user
   ranking. We decided to adopt such a metric instead of the Normalized
   Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG) [39] because, in a sequence of
   recommendations, it is not necessarily true that the first items are
   more important than the last ones.

   <mo>,</mo> <mi>c</mi> <mo>〉</mo> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]

   <mo>)</mo> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   .
   The value of this metric will result close to 1 when the sequences
   generated by the recommender are contradictory, to 0 when they have the
   same ranking, and to
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mn>0.5</mn> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   when the ordering is irrelevant because they contain different items. A
   low precision will imply a nDPM very close to
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mn>0.5</mn> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   .

4.2.4. Diversity

   The metric of sequence diversity included in this framework is inspired
   by the metric of Intra-List Similarity proposed by Ziegler et al. [40].
   The recommended sequences are considered to be lists of items and the
   obtained value is not related to their internal ordering. The purpose
   of this metric is understanding if the sequences contain items that are
   sufficiently diverse. A higher diversity may be beneficial for the
   users, as they are encouraged to better explore the catalog [41].

   is a generic similarity measure between two items. This measure may be
   taxonomy-driven or content-based: for example, a possible content-based
   similarity measure is the cosine similarity. The resulting value is a
   number in the interval
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mo>[</mo> <mn>0</mn> <mo>,</mo> <mn>2</mn>
   <mo>]</mo> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   : higher values represent a higher diversity.

4.2.5. Novelty

   Vargas et al. [42] suggested that it would be useful to be able to
   characterize the novelty of the recommendations. They proposed a metric
   that rewards algorithms capable of identifying items that have a low
   probability of being already known by a specific user because they
   belong to the long-tail of the catalog. We have included such metric in
   our framework to assess whether the items available in the suggested
   sequences are not too obvious.

   . We can define the probability of observing the item
   [MATH: <semantics> <mi>ι</mi> </semantics> :MATH]
   as the number of ratings related to
   [MATH: <semantics> <mi>ι</mi> </semantics> :MATH]
   in the training sequences divided by the total number of ratings
   available. We also assume that

   </msub> <mrow> <mo>(</mo> <mn>0</mn> <mo>)</mo> </mrow> <mo>≐</mo>
   <mn>0</mn> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   by definition, to avoid considering as novel items for which we do not
   have any information, i.e., the items that do not appear in the
   training sequences.

4.2.6. Serendipity

   Serendipity can be defined as the capability of identifying items that
   are both attractive and unexpected [43]. Ge et al. proposed to measure
   the serendipity of a recommender by relying on the precision of the
   generated lists after having discarded the items that are too
   obvious [33].
   To create a list of obvious items, it is possible to exploit a
   primitive recommender that is a recommender only capable of making
   obvious suggestions. For example, a primitive recommender could be
   implemented using the Most Popular (MP) baseline, which is defined in
   Section 4.3. It is reasonable to assume that popular items do not
   contribute to the serendipity of the recommendations because they are
   already well known by many users.
   By modifying the metric of precision described in Section 4.2.2, it is
   possible to introduce the concept of serendipity in the evaluation of a
   sequence-based recommender. In this case, the primitive recommender
   will always create a sequence of length k that contains the items that
   are have been observed with the highest frequency in the training set.

   <mo>^</mo> </mover> </semantics> :MATH]
   as the sequence generated by the primitive recommender from the same
   seed of
   [MATH: <semantics> <mover> <mi mathvariant="bold">s</mi> <mo>¯</mo>
   </mover> </semantics> :MATH]
   , i.e.,
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mover accent="true"> <mi

   mathvariant="bold">r</mi> <mn>1</mn> </msub> <mo>,</mo> <mi>k</mi>
   <mo>)</mo> </mrow> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   . Moreover, the sequence
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mover> <mi mathvariant="bold">s</mi>
   <mo>¯</mo> </mover> <mo>−</mo> <mover accent="true"> <mi
   mathvariant="bold">s</mi> <mo>^</mo> </mover> </mrow> </semantics>
   :MATH]
   contains all the ratings related to the items available in
   [MATH: <semantics> <mover> <mi mathvariant="bold">s</mi> <mo>¯</mo>
   </mover> </semantics> :MATH]
   that are not present in
   [MATH: <semantics> <mover accent="true"> <mi mathvariant="bold">s</mi>
   <mo>^</mo> </mover> </semantics> :MATH]
   . The resulting value will be a number in the interval
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mo>[</mo> <mn>0</mn> <mo>,</mo> <mn>1</mn>
   <mo>]</mo> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   , lower than or equal to precision. The difference between precision
   and serendipity represents the percentage of obvious items that are
   correctly suggested.

4.2.7. Confidence

   The metric of confidence reflects how much the system trusts its own
   suggestions and it is useful for understanding how robust the learned
   model is [44]. It is usually computed as the average probability that
   the suggested items are correct. This metric expresses the point of
   view of the recommender, as the probability is reported by the model.
   Therefore, the metric is always equal to 1 with the MP recommender, as
   it is certain of the predictions.
   A sequence-based recommender generates the next item of the sequence by
   considering all the previous items. For this reason, we can interpret
   the conditional probability of obtaining a certain item, given the
   sequence of previous ones, as the confidence that the system has in
   that suggestion.

   <mn>0</mn> </msub> <mo>≐</mo> <msub> <mi>ι</mi> <mn>1</mn> </msub>
   </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   , i.e., the zero-th item of the recommended sequence is its seed item.
   Therefore, this metric is computed by also considering the probability
   of obtaining the first item
   [MATH: <semantics> <msub> <mover> <mi>ι</mi> <mo>¯</mo> </mover>
   <mn>1</mn> </msub> </semantics> :MATH]
   , given the seed item of
   [MATH: <semantics> <mover> <mi mathvariant="bold">s</mi> <mo>¯</mo>
   </mover> </semantics> :MATH]
   .

4.2.8. Perplexity

   Perplexity is a widespread metric in the context of neural language
   modeling evaluation [35], typically used to measure the quality of the
   generated phrases. Because there is a strong similarity between
   creating a sequence of natural language words and sequence of
   recommended items given an initial seed, perplexity can be also
   successfully exploited in this context.
   This metric can be defined as the exponential in base 2 of the average
   negative log-likelihood of the model, i.e., the cross-entropy of the
   model. For models based on the cross-entropy loss function such as
   neural networks, the perplexity can also be seen as a measure of
   convergence of the learning algorithm. Differently from the metric of
   confidence, the conditional probability
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi>P</mi> <mo>(</mo> <msub> <mi>ι</mi>

   is computed considering the items of the test sequence

   , and not of the recommended sequence
   [MATH: <semantics> <mover> <mi mathvariant="bold">s</mi> <mo>¯</mo>
   </mover> </semantics> :MATH]
   . For this reason, it does not express the point of view of the
   recommender.

   Intuitively, the obtained value represents the number of items from
   which an equivalent random recommender should choose to obtain a
   similar sequence. The lower is the perplexity, the better is the system
   under evaluation. Therefore, the perplexity of a random recommender is
   equal to
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mo>|</mo> <mi mathvariant="script">I</mi>
   <mo>|</mo> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   . If the performance of the recommender is worse than a random one, the
   perplexity will be higher than
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mo>|</mo> <mi mathvariant="script">I</mi>
   <mo>|</mo> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   : for example, if only one conditional probability is equal to zero,
   then

   <mo>∞</mo> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   .

4.3. Implementation

   The third component of Sequeval is sequeval [45], a Python
   implementation of the evaluation framework which is publicly available
   on GitHub (https://github.com/D2KLab/sequeval). This implementation is
   based on the protocol presented in Section 4.1 and it includes the
   metrics described in Section 4.2.
   In details, sequeval is a Python package designed following a modular
   structure. For each component, we defined an abstract class and then we
   realized one or more possible implementations to enable software
   extensibility. For example, we have implemented an input module capable
   of processing a textual file in a MovieLens-like format (UIRT), but the
   support to other dataset formats can be easily added. The module
   representing the recommender system under analysis includes an abstract
   class that is based on the sequence generation logic formalized in
   Algorithm 2.
   To exploit the proposed framework, it is necessary to realize an
   implementation of the abstract recommender that must be capable, given
   the user and the current item of the sequence, of predicting the
   probabilities for the possible items of being the next one inside the
   recommended sequence. If the weighted random sampling generation logic
   is not appropriate, it is possible to override the relative method and
   to define an alternative recommendation approach.
   For obtaining the experimental results, it is necessary to write an
   evaluation script that relies on this library. We provide a simple
   evaluation script which can be used to perform different experiments.
   This script can be easily modified to accommodate novel recommendation
   techniques.
   We also created an extensive test suite achieving the 98% of code
   coverage for validating the robustness of our implementation and for
   better supporting future improvements. The total development cost of
   this Python library could be estimated around 40 h.
   For demonstrative purposes, we have implemented four baseline
   recommenders, which are illustrated in the following and represent our
   answer to RQ3. These baselines can be interpreted as an adaptation of
   classic non-personalized recommendation techniques to our
   sequence-based scenario.
     * Most Popular The MP recommender analyzes the sequences available in
       the training set to compute the popularity of each item, i.e., the
       number of times an item appears in the training sequences. Then, at
       recommendation time, it ignores the seed rating, and it always
       creates a sequence that contains the MP item as the first rating,
       the second MP item as the second rating, and so on. More formally,
       the probability that the item
       [MATH: <semantics> <msub> <mi>ι</mi> <mi>i</mi> </msub>
       </semantics> :MATH]
       will appear in the i-th rating of the sequence is
       [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi>P</mi> <mo>(</mo> <msub> <mi>ι</mi>
       <mi>i</mi> </msub> <mo>)</mo> <mo>=</mo> <mn>1</mn> </mrow>
       </semantics> :MATH]
       , where i also represents the position of the item in the ranking
       of the MP ones.
     * Random The random recommender simply creates sequences composed of
       ratings that contain an item randomly sampled from a uniform
       probability distribution. The seed rating is discarded and the
       probability of observing the item
       [MATH: <semantics> <msub> <mi>ι</mi> <mi>i</mi> </msub>
       </semantics> :MATH]
       is
       [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi>P</mi> <mo>(</mo> <msub> <mi>ι</mi>
       <mi>i</mi> </msub> <mo>)</mo> <mo>=</mo> <mn>1</mn> <mo>/</mo>
       <mo>|</mo> <mi mathvariant="script">I</mi> <mo>|</mo> </mrow>
       </semantics> :MATH]
       , where
       [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mo>|</mo> <mi
       mathvariant="script">I</mi> <mo>|</mo> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
       represents the number of items available in the system.
     * Unigram The unigram recommender can generate sequences that contain
       ratings with items sampled with a probability proportional to the
       number of times they were observed in the training sequences. In
       particular, the probability of observing the item
       [MATH: <semantics> <msub> <mi>ι</mi> <mi>i</mi> </msub>
       </semantics> :MATH]
       is equal to the number of ratings containing
       [MATH: <semantics> <msub> <mi>ι</mi> <mi>i</mi> </msub>
       </semantics> :MATH]
       divided by the total number of ratings available in the training
       sequences. As with the previous baselines, the seed rating is
       ignored during the recommendation phase.
     * Bigram The bigram recommender estimates the 1-st order transition
       probabilities among all possible pair of items available in the
       training sequences. The add-one smoothing technique is exploited to
       avoid the attribution of a strict zero probability to the pairs
       that were not observed during the training phase [46]. At
       recommendation time, the seed rating is exploited for selecting the
       first item, and then each item will influence the choice of the
       next one. The probability of sampling item
       [MATH: <semantics> <msub> <mi>ι</mi> <mi>i</mi> </msub>
       </semantics> :MATH]
       after item
       [MATH: <semantics> <msub> <mi>ι</mi> <mrow> <mi>i</mi> <mo>−</mo>
       <mn>1</mn> </mrow> </msub> </semantics> :MATH]
       is equal to the number of times this transition occurred in the
       training sequences plus one divided by the total number of
       transitions available.

5. Experimental Analysis

   In this section, we perform an experimental analysis of Sequeval by
   relying on its implementation described in Section 4.3 for comparing
   the behavior of the four baselines with a recommender system based on
   Conditional Random Fields (CRF) [47] and another one that exploits
   Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) [48]. The purpose of this comparison is
   to assess the validity of the framework by conducting an offline
   evaluation in a realistic scenario. Furthermore, we aim to investigate
   the efficiency of the proposed approach by analyzing the amount of time
   required to compute the numerical scores per each recommender system,
   considering datasets of different sizes.

5.1. Experimental Setup

   The main parameters that need to be specified according to our
   evaluation framework are the
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi>δ</mi> <mi>τ</mi> </mrow> </semantics>
   :MATH]
   value used to generate the sequences, the splitting protocol, and the
   length of the recommended sequences k. The
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi>δ</mi> <mi>τ</mi> </mrow> </semantics>
   :MATH]
   value and the splitting protocol depend on the dataset and they are
   reported in Section 5.2. For performing this empirical analysis, we
   have decided to exploit the
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mn>80</mn> <mo>%</mo> </mrow> </semantics>
   :MATH]
   of the dataset for training the recommenders and the remaining
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mn>20</mn> <mo>%</mo> </mrow> </semantics>
   :MATH]
   for testing purposes. The length of the recommended sequences depends
   on the specifications of the target application: for this evaluation,
   we have chosen to set
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi>k</mi> <mo>=</mo> <mn>5</mn> </mrow>
   </semantics> :MATH]
   .
   To compute the metric of diversity, we have selected the cosine
   similarity among the training sequences as the proximity measure
   between two items. In fact, we assume that two items are similar if
   they appear the same number of times inside the same training
   sequences. Furthermore, we have assumed that if an item is unknown, its
   similarity with another one is zero by definition.
   In the following, we provide the rationale for the usage and the
   implementation details of the two RSs based on CRF and RNN.

   CRF
          We have implemented a CRF-based recommender system using the
          CRFsuite software package
          (http://www.chokkan.org/software/crfsuite). Since we are
          interested in predicting an item given the previous one, we have
          considered to be feature vectors the training sequences without
          their last rating and as corresponding output vectors the same
          sequences without their first rating. We have used the gradient
          descent algorithm with the L-BFGS method [49] as the training
          technique. We have chosen to generate both the state and the
          transition features that do not occur in the dataset and we have
          set the maximum number of iterations allowed for the
          optimization algorithm to 100.

   RNN
          We have also experimented with a sequence recommender,
          originally designed for the tourism domain, based on RNN [50]
          that are specifically meant to deal with sequential data.
          The hyper-parameters of the network have been optimized through
          a manual search on the validation set in [50], obtaining:
          [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi mathvariant="normal">n</mi>
          <mo>_</mo> <mi>layers</mi> <mo>=</mo> <mn>3</mn> </mrow>
          </semantics> :MATH]
          ,
          [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi>dropout</mi> <mo>=</mo>
          <mn>0.2</mn> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
          ,
          [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi>learning</mi> <mo>_</mo>
          <mi>rate</mi> <mo>=</mo> <mn>0.0001</mn> </mrow> </semantics>
          :MATH]
          ,
          [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi mathvariant="normal">n</mi>
          <mo>_</mo> <mi>hidden</mi> <mo>=</mo> <mn>64</mn> </mrow>
          </semantics> :MATH]
          , and
          [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi mathvariant="normal">n</mi>
          <mo>_</mo> <mi>epochs</mi> <mo>=</mo> <mn>10</mn> </mrow>
          </semantics> :MATH]
          . The main difference of RNNs with respect to standard
          feed-forward neural networks is the presence of a hidden state
          variable
          [MATH: <semantics> <msub> <mi>h</mi> <mi>t</mi> </msub>
          </semantics> :MATH]
          , whose value depends both on the input data presented at time
          [MATH: <semantics> <msub> <mi>x</mi> <mi>t</mi> </msub>
          </semantics> :MATH]
          and on the previously hidden state
          [MATH: <semantics> <msub> <mi>h</mi> <mrow> <mi>t</mi>
          <mo>−</mo> <mn>1</mn> </mrow> </msub> </semantics> :MATH]
           [48] using loop connections. A typical application of RNNs in
          neural language modeling is the generation of text by
          recursively applying a “next word prediction” [51]. In the same
          spirit, we address the problem of next item prediction. The
          probability of the next rating given the previous ones
          [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi>P</mi> <mo>(</mo> <msub> <mi
          mathvariant="bold">r</mi> <mi>k</mi> </msub> <mo>|</mo> <mrow>

          <mn>1</mn> </mrow> </msub> <mo>〉</mo> </mrow> <mo>)</mo> </mrow>
          </semantics> :MATH]
          is learned during the training process of the neural network
          without the need for specifying a particular memory window as in
          Markov models.

   For conducting this experimental campaign, we relied on a machine
   equipped with two 12-cores Intel Xeon processors (E5-2680 v3 at
   2.50 GHz) and 128 GB of RAM. However, note that sequeval is a
   single-threaded application and its memory requirements are actually
   much lower, around 2.5 GB with the most demanding dataset at our
   disposal.

5.2. Datasets

   We have performed the experimental analysis considering two different
   datasets, namely Yes.com and Foursquare. The former is related to the
   musical domain, while the latter deals with check-ins performed at
   specific POIs.
   Because we are interested in modeling sequences, it is important that
   the temporal information available is actually meaningful. For example,
   the popular MovieLens datasets [52] cannot be exploited for our
   purposes because the timestamps are associated with the action of
   assigning a rating on the platform and not with the action of watching
   a movie. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that, if we apply
   Algorithm 1 to the MovieLens 1M dataset with
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi>δ</mi> <mi>τ</mi> <mo>=</mo> <mn>1</mn>
   <mspace width="4pt" /> <mi mathvariant="normal">h</mi> </mrow>
   </semantics> :MATH]
   , we obtain unrealistic sequences with an average length of about 56
   movies.
   The Yes.com and Foursquare datasets are characterized by a different
   distribution of their items, i.e., songs and venue categories, as it
   can be observed from Figure 2. In particular, Foursquare contains few
   items that are extremely popular, while Yes.com presents a plot that is
   smoother. This conclusion is numerically supported by the values of
   entropy [53] obtained for the two distributions, which are
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mn>4.95</mn> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   for Foursquare and
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mn>6.75</mn> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   for Yes.com. Furthermore, the number of sequences available in
   Foursquare is about 40 times higher with respect to Yes.com. Table 1
   summarizes the number of users, items, ratings, and sequences available
   in these datasets, which are described in detail in the following
   sections.

5.2.1. Yes.com

   This dataset contains several playlists originally collected by Shuo
   Chen from Yes.com in the context of his research on Metric
   Embedding [15]. Such website provided a set of APIs
   (http://web.archive.org/web/20150316134941/http://api.yes.com) for
   programmatically retrieving songs aired by different radio stations in
   the United States. By crawling them in the period from December 2010 to
   May 2011, he managed to obtain
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mn>2</mn> <mo>,</mo> <mn>840</mn> <mo>,</mo>
   <mn>553</mn> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   transitions. Even if Yes.com is no longer active, the playlist dataset
   is publicly available
   (https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~shuochen/lme/data_page.html).
   Yes.com does not include the timestamps, but only the playlists.
   Therefore, we have assumed that each playlist represents a sequence, as
   defined in our evaluation framework. In this case, it is not necessary
   to apply Algorithm 1 because the sequences are already available in the
   dataset in an explicit form. Because a timestamp-based splitting is not
   feasible, we have selected, for this dataset, a random splitting
   protocol for dividing the sequences between training and test set.
   Since we do not have any information regarding the radio stations, it
   is necessary to consider the playlists as if they were created by the
   same user. This approximation is acceptable in the context of sequence
   recommendation and it is allowed by the evaluation framework. In fact,
   differently from traditional evaluation approaches, all the metrics
   that we propose are averaged over the sequences and not over the users.
   Because of the computational complexity of the task, we have randomly
   reduced the complete dataset 10 times its original size and we have
   pruned the songs that appear less than 50 times.

5.2.2. Foursquare

   The second dataset that we have selected for performing the
   experimental evaluation of the framework is similar to the one
   described in [50] and it was created following the same protocol.
   We collected the check-ins performed by the users of the Foursquare
   Swarm mobile application (https://www.swarmapp.com) and publicly shared
   on Twitter from the Twitter API. Then, we retrieved the category of the
   place associated with the check-in thanks to the Foursquare API. For
   this reason, the items of the dataset are represented by the venue
   categories available in the Foursquare taxonomy
   (https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/resources/categories). The
   collection phase lasted from October to December 2017.
   To avoid exploiting the interactions generated by automated scripts, we
   have discarded the users that performed multiple check-ins in less than
   one minute. We have also pruned the check-ins associated with the venue
   categories that are usually not of interest for a tourist, for example
   the ones related to workplaces. For generating the sequences more
   efficiently, we decided to also remove the users that have performed
   less than 10 check-ins in total.
   We have set the
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mi>δ</mi> <mi>τ</mi> </mrow> </semantics>
   :MATH]
   parameter of the evaluation framework to 8 h. Regarding the splitting
   protocol, we have selected the timestamp-based one, considering the
   timestamp associated with the first rating as the timestamp of the
   sequence.

5.3. Results

   Table 2 summarizes the figures of the evaluation conducted with
   Yes.com. The MP recommender achieved a fair precision, but at the price
   of a very low coverage, because its predictions are deterministic.
   Unsurprisingly, the lowest precision and the highest novelty and
   diversity are associated with the random recommender. In contrast, the
   unigram, the bigram, and the CRF recommenders obtained comparable
   scores of precision, but the bigram is the most appealing of these
   three techniques, because of its lower perplexity and higher novelty.
   We can observe that the RNN recommender achieved the highest precision
   and the lowest perplexity, resulting in be the most promising algorithm
   for future online experimentations. Its nDPM is slightly lower than
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mn>0.5</mn> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   , meaning that the items are usually predicted in the correct order. We
   can also observe that its serendipity is close to the value of
   precision: for this reason, it is possible to assume that most of the
   sequences are not obvious.
   Table 3 lists, instead, the results obtained with Foursquare. In this
   case, the MP recommender system accounted for the highest precision,
   meaning that the top-5 items are extremely widespread, but, as usual,
   its coverage is very limited, and it achieved the lowest novelty. On
   the other hand, the random recommender scored the lowest precision, and
   the highest coverage and novelty. The differences among the unigram,
   the bigram, and the CRF recommenders are more striking than in the
   previous experiment: with this dataset, the unigram accounted for
   higher precision because of the popularity of some items, while the
   bigram for the lowest perplexity.
   The RNN recommender system obtained the second-best precision and
   perplexity, resulting in a good compromise if we are interested in
   optimizing both these metrics. Its fair coverage and the low value of
   serendipity are other hints of the fact that the Foursquare dataset
   contains few items that are very popular: this characteristic was, in
   fact, learned and exploited by the recommender.
   Finally, we report in Table 4 the amount of time needed for computing
   the previously described evaluation metrics per recommendation
   algorithm with the Foursquare and Yes.com datasets. We observe that in
   the worst case, the evaluation framework was able to conduct an
   experimental campaign in a few hours. The metric of diversity was the
   most computationally expensive one because of the time needed to
   compute the cosine similarity. This fact is particularly evident if we
   consider the seconds spent to evaluate the random recommender with the
   Foursquare dataset.
   As expected, the baseline recommenders are less demanding with respect
   to the CRF and RNN models. However, this analysis is beyond the scope
   of this work, as we are only interested in optimizing the evaluation
   framework. If we do not consider the metric of diversity, we observe
   that the time required for the evaluation phase is linear with respect
   to the size of the dataset.

5.4. Discussion

   In the following, we will analyze the results of the empirical analysis
   to justify the answers to the research questions that were provided in
   Section 3 and in Section 4. In particular, our main aim is to explain
   why it is necessary to rely on a framework that includes several
   metrics to evaluate a sequence-based recommender system.
   In Section 3 we have introduced the concept of rating and we have
   defined it considering three different elements: an item, a user, and a
   timestamp. The idea of associating a user with an item is the basic
   principle of almost every recommender, while the timestamp is necessary
   in order to introduce a temporal dimension, and, therefore, the
   possibility of creating and suggesting sequences, as proposed in RQ1.
   Nevertheless, we have successfully applied our evaluation framework in
   an experiment based on the Yes.com dataset, which does not include any
   user. Even though a more general use case has been considered during
   its formalization, it is possible to also exploit it in other
   scenarios, still obtaining an interesting picture of the recommenders.
   As described in Section 4.2, our answer to RQ2 is an evaluation
   framework that includes eight different metrics, capable of capturing
   the various characteristics of the algorithms available. For example,
   even if the precision of the MP recommender system is very high when
   tested with Foursquare, we can immediately discard it because of its
   low coverage. In the same way, the interesting values of diversity and
   novelty achieved by the random recommender are associated with an
   unacceptable score of perplexity.
   In Table 5 we present an interpretation of the metrics available in the
   framework. These descriptions are meant to offer a human understanding
   of the results of the offline evaluation. It is worth noticing that
   these metrics consider only some of the properties of a recommender
   system [18]. However, it is our opinion that those properties are the
   most salient ones that can be analyzed in our context, without
   realizing a live system.
   The different characteristics of the datasets exploited during the
   empirical analysis are reflected in their respective figures. In
   particular, while the values of precision obtained by the random
   recommender in the two experiments are comparable, the figures
   associated with both MP and unigram methods are dramatically different.
   This fact suggests that Foursquare contains a few items that are
   extremely popular, as it was already clear from Figure 2.
   On the other hand, the RNN recommender obtained, with both datasets,
   comparable values of precision, but a very different coverage. For this
   reason, we can suppose that this approach, differently from the CRF
   recommender, is capable of better adapting itself to the
   characteristics of the dataset. The fact that we can draw such a
   conclusion supports the validity of Sequeval.
   Furthermore, we have observed that the amount of time required to
   compute the evaluation metrics is linear with respect to the dataset
   size, if we do not consider the metric of diversity. In fact, the
   computational cost of the cosine similarity was too elevated when we
   analyzed the behavior of the random recommender with a more demanding
   dataset. However, because of the modular structure of sequeval, it is
   easy to avoid computing the metric of diversity for such a recommender.
   In line with RQ3, we have described in Section 4.3 four different
   baseline recommenders. From the results of the experiments, it is
   possible to observe that the values obtained by some of them are fixed.
   For example, the MP recommender will always achieve a serendipity equal
   to 0, and a confidence equal to 1. Its perplexity is usually
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mo>+</mo> <mo>∞</mo> </mrow> </semantics>
   :MATH]
   , if at least one of the recommended sequences is incorrect. The items
   suggested are, in fact, considered obvious by definition, and the
   algorithm is certain of the recommendation because its behavior is
   deterministic. In a similar way, the perplexity of the random
   recommender is equal to the total number of items available, i.e.,
   [MATH: <semantics> <mrow> <mo>|</mo> <mi mathvariant="script">I</mi>
   <mo>|</mo> </mrow> </semantics> :MATH]
   , because of the definition of perplexity provided in Section 4.2.8.
   These two baselines are methods commonly exploited in the literature
   for evaluating RSs. Additionally, we have proposed two techniques
   better suited for the sequence recommendation problem. The unigram
   recommender is similar to the MP one, but it is non-deterministic, and
   it obtained a higher novelty. In contrast, the bigram recommender is
   the most complex baseline, because it considers the previous item to
   suggest the next one. For this reason, it always achieved the lowest
   perplexity among the baselines considered.

6. Conclusions

   In this paper, we have discussed the problem of recommending sequences
   of items tailored to the needs of a certain user. We have introduced an
   offline evaluation framework, called Sequeval, capable of handling this
   novel family of RSs in an offline scenario and we have developed an
   implementation of it that is publicly available on GitHub. We have
   included in such a framework an evaluation protocol and eight different
   metrics, to better capture the characteristics of the algorithms
   considered.
   We have performed an empirical analysis of Sequeval by relying on it
   for conducting a comparison among four baselines, a CRF recommender,
   and an RNN-based one. The results have highlighted the fact that this
   framework is flexible, as it can be successfully applied in
   non-standard recommendation scenarios, such as with Yes.com, and
   complete, because of the different metrics included that consider
   several dimensions of the recommended sequences. In addition, we have
   observed that the RNN recommender system can effectively adapt itself
   to the characteristics of the training dataset. This conclusion
   supports the validity of Sequeval as a tool for conducting an offline
   experimentation.
   Nevertheless, it is important being aware of the limitations of such a
   framework. The availability of many metrics may produce results which
   are difficult to interpret, especially if we are uncertain of what are
   the most relevant dimensions in our recommendation scenario. More in
   general, this is a common limitation of offline experiments, and it
   needs to be addressed by comparing the most promising algorithms in a
   subsequent online trail.
   The formal definitions provided in Section 3 have been conceived as an
   extension of the seminal works on RSs capable of recommending
   sequences. For this reason, it is possible to set the length of the
   recommended sequences to 1 if we are interested in obtaining a single
   item. In a similar way, the item included in the seed rating can be
   exploited in order to set the context of the recommendation, but it can
   also be ignored if we want a sequence only based on the target user.
   As future work, we plan to study in more depth what are the
   relationships among the different metrics included in the framework,
   with the purpose of integrating them in a final value that expresses
   the overall quality of the recommender. Such global score should be
   related to the recommendation scenario: for example, diversity may be
   important when recommending POIs to a tourist, but less useful in the
   musical domain.
   Furthermore, it would be desirable to be able to create an evaluation
   framework that is adopted by a community of researcher when testing
   their algorithms, harmonizing the evaluation protocols and the
   interpretation of the performance of sequence-based RSs. For this
   reason, it is necessary to identify and to include in it some
   meaningful datasets, related to different domains that could be
   exploited during the evaluation phase, as well as other baselines and
   new RSs. The strategic choice of publicly releasing sequeval fosters
   further reuse and extension.
   Finally, we would like to expand our evaluation framework to also
   support the online experimentation that should be performed after the
   offline analysis. The final goal of this work is, in fact, to enable
   researchers to spend more time in realizing the recommendation
   algorithm as they can rely on an evaluation framework that has already
   been designed and validated.

Abstract

   Recommender systems have gained a lot of popularity due to their large
   adoption in various industries such as entertainment and tourism.
   Numerous research efforts have focused on formulating and advancing
   state-of-the-art of systems that recommend the right set of items to
   the right person. However, these recommender systems are hard to
   compare since the published evaluation results are computed on diverse
   datasets and obtained using different methodologies. In this paper, we
   researched and prototyped an offline evaluation framework called
   Sequeval that is designed to evaluate recommender systems capable of
   suggesting sequences of items. We provide a mathematical definition of
   such sequence-based recommenders, a methodology for performing their
   evaluation, and the implementation details of eight metrics. We report
   the lessons learned using this framework for assessing the performance
   of four baselines and two recommender systems based on Conditional
   Random Fields (CRF) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), considering
   two different datasets. Sequeval is publicly available and it aims to
   become a focal point for researchers and practitioners when
   experimenting with sequence-based recommender systems, providing
   comparable and objective evaluation results. View Full-Text

Abstract

   Concentrations of ambient fine particles (PM[10]: particles with an
   aerodynamic diameter ≤ 10 µm) are still exceeding current air quality
   standards in many European cities. In Munich (Germany), low emission
   zone and transit bans for heavy-duty vehicles were introduced in 2008
   aiming at reduction of traffic emissions contribution to PM[10]. The
   effects of those measures on PM[10] mass concentrations in Munich were
   investigated with a semiparametric regression model for modeling PM[10]
   levels adjusted for time, background pollution, public holidays and
   wind direction. The reduction of PM[10] concentration after the
   introduction of the measures was larger at a traffic monitoring site
   (13.0 %, 19.6 % in summer, and 6.8 % in winter) and smaller in urban
   background (4.5 %, 5.7 % in summer, and 3.2 % in winter). The effect
   was most pronounced on Fridays and on the weekends in summer. View

Abstract

   Concentrations of ambient fine particles (PM[10]: particles with an
   aerodynamic diameter ≤ 10 µm) are still exceeding current air quality
   standards in many European cities. In Munich (Germany), low emission
   zone and transit bans for heavy-duty vehicles were introduced in 2008
   aiming at reduction of traffic emissions contribution to PM[10]. The
   effects of those measures on PM[10] mass concentrations in Munich were
   investigated with a semiparametric regression model for modeling PM[10]
   levels adjusted for time, background pollution, public holidays and
   wind direction. The reduction of PM[10] concentration after the
   introduction of the measures was larger at a traffic monitoring site
   (13.0 %, 19.6 % in summer, and 6.8 % in winter) and smaller in urban
   background (4.5 %, 5.7 % in summer, and 3.2 % in winter). The effect
   was most pronounced on Fridays and on the weekends in summer. View
