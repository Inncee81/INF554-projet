Help support a great cause by buying this 1969 Honda Z50A K1

   I recently met the man who runs Lil’ Bikes Restoration in Brownsburg,
   Indiana. He restores Honda Z50 and CT70 motorcycles.

   Over the course of the next week, he’s auctioning off a 1969 Honda Z50A
   K1. The proceeds will go to breast cancer awareness via the American
   Cancer Society.

If you’re looking for a casual jacket with some protection built-in, check
out the Scorpion Covert Hoody.

   The Scorpion Covert Hoody is a unique item that looks like street
   clothes. It’s nice riding in regular street clothes, but we all know
   that regular street clothes don’t offer much protection at all, which
   is why this jacket makes so much sense.

   It’s simple, looks like pretty much any other hoody you’d grab off the
   shelf, and offers some much-needed protection.

   alternative. It offers some minor protection with a casual look and

   Lil’ Bikes Restoration Breast Cancer Awareness 1969 Honda Z50A K1

Help support a great cause by buying this 1969 Honda Z50A K1

   I recently met the man who runs Lil’ Bikes Restoration in Brownsburg,
   Indiana. He restores Honda Z50 and CT70 motorcycles.

   Over the course of the next week, he’s auctioning off a 1969 Honda Z50A
   K1. The proceeds will go to breast cancer awareness via the American
   Cancer Society.

If you’re looking for a casual jacket with some protection built-in, check
out the Scorpion Covert Hoody.

   The Scorpion Covert Hoody is a unique item that looks like street
   clothes. It’s nice riding in regular street clothes, but we all know
   that regular street clothes don’t offer much protection at all, which
   is why this jacket makes so much sense.

   It’s simple, looks like pretty much any other hoody you’d grab off the
   shelf, and offers some much-needed protection.
