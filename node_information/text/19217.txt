Nikon Z 85mm F1.8 S sample gallery

   Nikon's latest Z-series prime is one of its most impressive, offering
   very similar optical characteristics to the Z 50mm F1.8 S which we
   liked so much when we tested it back in January. Providing a
   traditional portrait focal length and moderately fast aperture, the Z
   85mm is fairly pricey by the standards of an F1.8 prime, but it's hard
   to argue with the image quality, at any price.

   We've been shooting with the Z 85mm F1.8 S for a few days, to see what
   it can do. Take a look through our full gallery of sample images.
   Is this our most dog-heavy sample gallery yet? it might just be.

   Far too often I feel like official sample images don't do justice to

   Beautiful results of a well made lens. Not sure about the price though.
   I mean, Nikon definitely wins in this category, again, but it is still
   only an F1.8 lens. However, it's a much much nicer option than
   something like a $1000 56F1.2 crop. Which proves the point that crops
   are ridiculously overpriced and overrated.

   I am extremely happy with my Z6 and the lenses 24-70 f/4, 50 f/1.8 and
   35 f/1.8. Happy shooting for two months already. Never seen or tried
   anything like this before (had Nikon DX and FX and also tried some
   Canons and Sonies). Tried 85 f/1.8 in the shop a few days ago and it is
   stellar, can't believe it. I own the F-mount 85 f/1.8 and compared it
   with this new S lens. I was happy to have my F-mount lens + FTZ and
   believed it was just fine for my needs but this new lens is something
   special. Extremely sharp at any f, great bokeh, fairly compact. A bit
   pricey, but Christmas is coming - can't wait for a few more months.

   While the Canon R lenses look as sexy and impressive as they can be, I

   This is exactly why I switched to the Nikon mirrorless from Canon. The
   lens lineup isn't as 'pretty' as Canon, but they're very functional .
   The matte finish is actually growing on me. I think it hides dust and
   finger oil better than the Canon semi-gloss surface.

   Obviously there are enough people who either need (or have been hyped
   intp believing that they need) the sort of wide-aperture super-optics
   that Canon and others are releasing, but yes, F2, F2.8 or F4 lenses are
   fine for most purposes. Lighter, more compact, cheaper and usually of
   equal image quality at the apertures people most commonly use.

   The Sigma 45mm 2.8 is an example of a lens that in some situations, or
   for some people, will actually be perceived as better optically than a
   high end modern 1.2 prime. Given the resolution performance targets
   that modern lenses are expected to achieve in most lens reviews
   (otherwise they'd be trashed) very fast primes have so little on axis
   aberrations left by f2.8 that they can't use them like the Sigma does
   to enhance / modulate rear OOF transitions at smaller apertures.
   I used to think that at 85mm I'd like to have at least f2 but these
   days I'm more and more inclined to favour a f2.8 with nearly non
   existent vignetting and a design philosophy otherwise not dissimilar to
   the Sigma.

   Canon has some cool stuff for sure, but I wonder how many people will
   be using them. I just handled the 28-70 f2 at B&H recently and that
   thing is enormous. Its pushing the envelope for even the modern gear
   people who seem to enjoy carrying around big lenses.

   I applaud Nikon for their sound strategy: why in the age of great high
   ISO and IBIS would we be hauling around big, expensive 1.4 lenses?
   These Nikons seems to be the sweet spot of everything.

   I have the Tamron 85mm 1.8 SP that's used with D500 and Z6 and just

   rendering. Resolution wise the Nikon seems to be the winner but OOF

   Well, Maya, since the S in Nikon’s Z lenses seems to stand for
   “Software-corrected” it’s probable that Nikon’s lens profile removes CA
   and any distortion via software whether the photographer wants Nikon to
   do that or not. 🤣

   Given that software correction can't effectively automatically correct

   Not out of character. Your well known in these forums addiction to
   fantaisies and pseudo-scientific babbling nonsense makes it no surprise
   that you still believe (emphasis on belief as you'll fail to provide
   evidence for that) that Nikon's S primes require any more software
   correction than others.

   I really like this lens.

   Compared to my Nikkor 85mm f/1.4G and Nikkor 85mm f/1.8G, the Nikkor
   85mm f/1.8 S is sharper, has excellent bokeh, and has very minimal
   purple fringing even when used in harsh lighting condition.

   This lens also focuses a bit faster, more accurately and is quieter as
   well. Flare resistance is good as is color.

   Stabilization is also notably better (being a native Z-mount lens means
   IBIS is more effective than an F-mount with an FTZ).

   The times when I felt as pleased with a lens as this was when I got the
   Nikkor 200mm f/2.0, Zeiss 135mm f/2.0, Nikkor 105mm f/1.4E and the
   Nikkor 19mm f/4E PC. It's good to the point where I no longer feel the
   need to use the bigger heavier Nikkor 105mm f/1.4E on FTZ to pair with
   the Nikkor 35mm f/1.8 S on a 2nd Z6. The weight reduction is quite
   substantial.

   Given how good this lens is, I look forward to Nikon producing a Nikkor
   135mm f/1.8 S ... hopefully soon!

   has been been my holy grail of a fast telephoto/portrait lens but the
   new 85 makes you pixel peep at 2:1 to try to find any difference. It’s
   that good. But yes, the 85 1.2 will be more of the same and a faster
   T-stop. And probably $3000. Diminishing returns.

   I compared it to my Sigma 85/1.4 Art. At the same aperture, the Nikkor
   often shows a more nervous bokeh. What I also dislike very much: if the
   AF is off and I enlarge LV to correct it manually, there's a lag
   between turning the focusring and the stepping motor effectively waking
   up. In dark conditions the Z 7 struggles with AF. Might be better with
   the Z 6, but the struggling starts at EV values I'm still able to focus
   the Art.

   It is rather compact and rather sharp, but I'm not blown away. I was
   expecting more at this price and I also would have appreciated a lens
   display - the Z system apparently doens't measure or approximate
   distance.

   Just for instance... if the background is far (enough) away, the
   rendering is nice. But the stone structures just started behind the
   main subject and I can't find the rendering nice.

   I understand your wish to see the complete picture as a 100% crop blows
   up little flaws to elephantic ones. BUt then, the lens costs 1000 $ -
   not exactly a cheapo. And the Z 7 delivers resolution...

   Thanks. It's more a question of putting these crops in context. Alone
   they can't be enough to form an opinion as the transition zone can vary
   a lot depending on many factors and some trade offs here and there can
   provide benefits otherwise. Perhaps I'm wrong but these are not from
   the centre of the frame, right ?

Hands-on with the Canon EOS M200

Meet the Canon EOS M200

   The Canon EOS M200 is a modest update to the M100 that was announced in
   August 2017. Most of the changes are courtesy of the new Digic 8
   processor, which allows for 4K video capture, eye detection autofocus
   and improved battery life.

   Canon didn't change the design of the camera because, frankly, this
   entry-level, selfie-friendly camera didn't need it. But more about that
   in the slides ahead.

   The M200 will be available in October in your choice of white or black
   for $549/£499/€569, which includes the EF-M 15-45mm F4.5-6.3 IS STM
   lens.

   When a camera company releases a camera without giving a prototype to
   reviewers they are saying this camera is not for you. The camera is too
   low end for camera people...our target market is for someone who has
   never used a camera before.

   The M100 has always looked like a ‘handbag’ camera; but get over the
   fact you don’t have a PSAM dial and what you do have is a cracking
   camera with great IQ, fantastic screen and a low cost, pin sharp lens
   range ... even the option to add EF-S lenses!

   In the UK you can pick up a new M100 for sub £300 ... and when you take
   a moment to investigate this camera, you realise it’s a bit of a hidden
   gem! (You can then upgrade to the M5/M6 and carry over the glass).

   This upgrade is about as inspiring as the upgrade from the 20D to the
   30D. The Fuji X-A7 makes a far better case for smartphone users wanting
   to upgrade to an entry level camera with video. The 4K video crop on
   the M200 was inevitable, given the size of the camera, and it doesn't
   bother me. However, it will make the YouTube talking heads happy -
   those egocentric folks who believe that their dull talking head content
   must be in 4K with "cinematic" 24p frame rate.

   If the X-A7 isn't affordable, and you can live without most of the new
   features it comes with, then a refurbished M100 certainly is
   affordable. In Canada, at the time of this post, Best Buy sells
   refurbished M100s for $390 CDN or about $293 US - and you might grab a
   used one for even less.

   Comparing this to Fuji XA7, which costs $700 when the Canon costs $150
   less. $700 is not entry level, that's midrange. This Canon is entry

   $150 is a lot of difference in the entry level segment. That's half a

   As many of us who have used the likes of the EOS M10, followed by the
   EOS M100, we can attest to the "fun factor" involved. In addition to
   superb APS-C IQ levels, whenever I reach for my M100, it becomes such a
   breeze to use. And when holding this camera, it almost defies logic
   that Canon managed to put an APS-C sized sensor in that tiny
   (pocketable) body. There are a multitude of options available in the
   menu structure even though it has a minimalist exterior body design.

   I don't know if I'd want to "upgrade" to this model over the M100, but
   it will still sell quite well (IMO, that is). And as usual - as if
   right on que - the self proclaimed naysayers (doesn't matter what brand
   of camera it is) - will knock this model for this or that reason. But
   that's life I suppose.
   As an M user, I can see this camera continuing to sell just fine,
   perhaps not to folks with the current M100, but more so for new users.
   All of the brands do these incremental upgrades.

   If the camera had an EVF and was therefore being used at eye-level, a

   Grapejam - The M50 and M200 are aimed at completely different markets.

   The M50 is for photographers, most of who regard an EVF as essential
   (with one or two exceptions, such as street photographers).

   The M200 is aimed primarily at the selfie crowd, and at people who
   normally shoot on a smartphone, and prefer to view the scene on the
   rear screen).

   Neither are intended for anyone remotely serious about video. Video in
   most Canon cameras is just something they throw in to satisfy those who
   somehow think a camera without video is "incomplete". If you are at all
   serious about video, you should be looking at Panasonic, not Canon.

   And Yes the M6 is a very nice camera with great features, the first

   But when we look at Sony A7R4 the Canon M6 is pathetic with only 32.5
   MP. And the A9 can shoot 20FPS without much yellow effect in the
   pictures as the sensor is so damn fast. It does focussing very fast,
   and it has a lot of connection ports more (headphone, network etc) Oh
   and the battery life, The A9 is twice as long as with you M6!
   The A9 has a max mechanical shutterspeed of 1/8000 vs 1/4000 for the M6
   and a 1/32000 vs 1/16000 for the M6.
   And the A9 has a much larger sensor. So you are comparing apples with

   @AdamT: I fully agree with you, as my last sentence in my post shows.
   I see the M6 as a great little camera with its flaws (like the lack of
   an EVF, the crop in video, no 24fps etc.) But still an impressive
   camera, that indeed should be compared with the A6400.
   @jnd: The OP was comparing the M6 with the A9 and told that the A9 has
   a poor 24MP resolution.
   And when you reed my post you see that I find the comparison between
   these two cameras ridiculous.
   For the rest I called the M6 a very nice camera with great features,
   the first really exciting Canon update in years. But I like what Canon
   did with this camera, the sensor resolution is not very important for
   me at all.
   What most people forget is that the A9 has a resolution of 6000x4000
   and the M6 has a resolution of 6960x4640 pixels. So the resolution is
   only 960x640 more in every direction. So that is not much for cropping.
   I called the 32 MP pathetic compared to the A7RIV, and I do think that
   the 61MP overkill for most of us.

   Tweet

   Canon has introduced the EOS M200, an entry-level mirrorless camera.
   It's a fairly modest upgrade to one of our favorite cameras, the EOS
   M100. Its new Digic 8 processor allows for Dual Pixel AF with eye
   detection, heavily cropped 4K/24p video and improved battery life.

   Everything else is the same as before: the M200 has a 24MP APS-C
   sensor, compact body with a selfie-friendly touchscreen and an
   easy-to-use interface.

   The EOS M200 will be available in October, bundled with the collapsable
   15-45mm F3.5-6.3 IS STM lens for $549/£499/€569.

   Both are entry level mirrorless, in the same price range. Sony just

   6100 =$750

   The EOS-M cameras are plenty but where's the lenses? The only lens I
   like is the 11-22mm. I can list at least five more really good lenses
   that's needed. None of the other zooms can match the 11-22mm.

   It's true. Except for the barrel distortion, the 11-22 is really good.
   I didn't find any of the others, including the 22mm, to be in the same
   league as the 11-22.

   It lacks a PASM dial and features that exist on much more expensive
   cameras yes; but as you say, it’s targeted at those with smaller
   budgets who don’t operate movie studios ... so what’s your beef other
   than just using this as an (unwarranted) opportunity to moan at Canon!
   This is actually a very good camera and for the many features it
   doesn’t have, it equally has many good ones of note!

   When the founding fathers made 16:9 aspect ratio, they never foresaw
   the absurdity of people shooting it in portrait mode. Sigh.

   Phones should default to 1:1 aspect ratio video capture. EOS-m200's as
   well apparently.

   why would you advocate for 1:1 video? You want massive black bars on
   the sides for ALL video, and not just the ones shot vertical and viewed
   on regular monitors?

   Because people aren't making the decision on 9:16 or 16:9, they're just
   hitting the record button. If you can't trust them to understand it,
   shoot 1:1 and crop later.

   I trust people to notice that their subject fits in 9:16, but is
   cropped in half on 16:9. That's why most people actually shoot
   vertical, to fit their subject.

   Ironically the same reason we shoot stills in portrait orientation even

   M200 is $599. with kit lens. Not sure where you find $400. For entry

   I had the m100 but traded up to a M6 where you can add a EVF if you

   As many of us who have used the likes of the EOS M10, followed by the
   EOS M100, we can attest to the "fun factor" involved. In addition to
   superb APS-C IQ levels, whenever I reach for my M100, it becomes such a
   breeze to use. And when holding this camera, it almost defies logic
   that Canon managed to put an APS-C sized sensor in that tiny
   (pocketable) body. There are a multitude of options available in the
   menu structure even though it has a minimalist exterior body design.

   I don't know if I'd want to "upgrade" to this model over the M100, but
   it will still sell quite well (IMO, that is). And as usual - as if
   right on que - the self proclaimed naysayers (doesn't matter what brand
   of camera it is) - will knock this model for this or that reason. It's
   par for the course and to be expected - sigh...

   As an M user, I can see this camera continuing to sell just fine,
   perhaps not to folks with the current M100, but more so for new users.
   All of the brands do these incremental upgrades.

   So, Canon is continuing with four different lens mounts: EF, EF-S,

   This makes no sense to me at all. It might have disappointed folks, but
   Nikon stopped making the 1-mount series in July 2018 -- as Z became a
   thing -- and I really expected Canon would take some steps to shuffle
   EF-M users to an RF model (which could be an APS-C body with an

   i think the strategy canon is going for is that they will target low

   would milk customers (read 2500$ plus lenses etc) on RF mount.

   They are also doing this in case the business in one mount collapses
   then they would focus on another mount. For example M can go out of
   favour due to smartphones then RF survives on rich customers who want
   something to differentiate from smarphone crowd (also on amateurs and
   pros).

   They are playing safe and watching where future goes.

   miggylicious: EF was the first fully electronic mount, EF-S allowed
   lenses to extend back farther into the body (because the 1.6X crop
   mirror is smaller, hence doesn't hit), and RF is basically a full-frame
   mount allowing the flange to be about where EF-S glass went to. EF-M
   is, well, an attempt to copy Sony E? EF-M lenses are not adaptable to
   anything, while all Canon's others (including the old FL/FD/FDn) are
   adaptable to RF.

   If I were Canon, I'd fire sale EF-M stuff and give some type of
   discount to move to a 1.6X crop RF (which they haven't yet made but
   definitely should). I'd also be planning to discontinue EF/EF-S when
   the DSLR sales make them no longer worth the bother -- which,
   realistically, might take another decade.

   Lots of speculation, and Gesture has it right. The M series has been
   around since 2012 with with first m body, is in its 6th version bodies
   so far in m6. (counting m50 and m6ii and now m200) and there are over 6
   lenses with 3 primes, (including - 28mm macro prime, 32mm f1.4, 22mm
   f2) and 3 zooms (kit 15-45, 55-200, 18-150mm). Someone buying one of
   these bodies will probably only buy 2 to 3 lenses at most. So yes,
   enough lens for compact users. (Add an EFs/EF to M adapter for adding
   your existing lens.)

   This camera completes with Sonys A6xxx models, and a good alternative
   to m43 cameras. The m100, m50 and m6 are very good sellers, which is
   why new models are being released. It is easy to adapt EFs lenses to
   the m series with an adapter. The M series are meant to be a compact
   camera for use.

   This is a different market than the R cameras and RF lenses. The EF and
   EFs lenses are not dead, just slowly decreasing in sales each year, as
   mirrorless in R, and m series continue to grow.

   profhank: if you reuse the ef mount (with millions of lenses already
   available) for mirrorless, you will not have an issue with protruding
   ef-s lenses because it is already mirrorless. and using an adapter
   never gives the same feeling of a direct mounted lens. why not just
   make a mirrorless ef so that you won't need an adapter? and with the
   added space inside, canon could possibly add extremely useful features
   like an ND filter or large heatsinks to prevent overheating for videos.

   Actually thinking about it I suspect they could read all the pixels (as

   line but that would break bayer, so I assume they could read the whole
   sensor (16:9 crop that is) and just do the simplest scaling option of
   using 2x2 bayer blocks to make pixels and upscaling by 10-ish% to give
   4k.

   (The 16:9 crop is 6960 x 3904, making 2x2 pixels gives 3480 x 1952,
   which is about 10% off 3840 x 2160. Note the sensor/processor
   combination in the M6II can 30fps somewhat cropped Raws until it runs
   out of buffer, so reading the whole 16:9 area at 30fps is certainly
   possible..)

   I don't know what film cameras are doing but not downsampling from 6k
   just seems like inherently inferior to me. Of course they shoot raw and

   Just in case people thought the Leopard changed its spots. This is

   I definitely prefer fully articulated, side-hinged LCDs for stills,
   because they are useful in portrait orientation as well. Tilt-only LCDs
   are pretty much useless in portrait mode.

   If I had saved a penny for every person I’ve seen using live view when
   they really should have been using the VF, I could probably afford an
   M200 by now. (The worst one I remember was a guy trying very hard to
   hold a D850 and 24-70VR right in front of his face. Gawd what a waste
   of an awesome piece of gear!) Those people probably wouldn’t even
   notice the VF missing.

   @chadley_chad I see your relativist position and reject it utterly. Of
   course people are free to shoot how they like; that does not mean
   they’re doing it in a suboptimal manner, much less give you any right
   to tell me to shut up.

   The people I would have been saving pennies for were not trying to
   shoot at odd angles or on a tripod, where live view would have had
   distinct advantages. Rather they were shooting with the camera a few
   inches right in front of their faces, and they could have just as
   easily pulled the camera up to their face and shot with the viewfinder.
   Using the viewfinder would have given them more stable postures;
   eliminated screen glare; and in the case of the D850 guy, possibly the
   best ILC AF system in the world rather than one of the worst (Nikon’s
   DSLR live view AF being a bad joke compared to the OVF variety).

   I often hold my camera close to my face because, as a wearer of
   glasses, sometimes it’s just easier to use the LCD than taking off your
   glasses and using the EVF. I guess in your world I should be using
   contacts instead of glasses!

   A new Chinese optics manufacturer has released the DULENS APO 85mm F2,
   a manual medium telephoto prime for Canon EF and Nikon F camera
   systems.

   Although not much is known about DULENS itself, Newsshooter is
   reporting it’s been told that the optical engineer behind DULENS is the

   The lens, which is inspired by the Zeiss Sonnar series, is constructed
   of seven elements in six groups and includes an Apochromatic element to
   reduce chromatic aberration. It measures 5.8cm (2.28in) long, weighs
   350g (12.35oz), features a 29-degree field-of-view, uses a 55mm front
   filter thread and has a minimum focusing distance of 90cm (35.43in).

   Below are a number of high-resolution sample images shared on the
   product listing. These were shot with the lens on a Lumix S1 using an
   EF adapter:

   The lens is available to pre-order in black and silver varieties for
   Canon EF and Nikon F camera systems. It’s currently listed for ¥2999
   (approximately $420) on Chinese retailer Taobao, but Newsshooter says
   the company intends to release the lens in the United States and Europe
   market for $599.

   We have contacted the retailer for more information on the lens and
   availability and will update this article if and when we receive a
   response.

   Interesting. But is it any better than the Nikkor 85/2.0 AiS I already
   have (and bought thirty years ago, used), on a D850? Does anyone know
   if it has the same optical construction? Better coatings?

   Ahh. No. Seven elements in six groups as opposed to five elements in
   five groups in the old Nikkor (which is great on b&w film, but not so
   good with 46 Mp).

   many Chinese lenses cannot pass the flashlight test. I see different
   types of dust inside some are ridiculously big. I don't have problem
   using Chinese made but they don't have pride of their products, such as
   terrible user instructions, no customer services and bad quality
   control. One most important thing is they're only after profits but
   done nothing worthy to the society or environment.

   In the Chinese text they say the optical formula includes:

   - two elements made of glass with anomalous partial dispersion
   - three elements made of lanthanum glass (glass containing lanthanum
   oxide) and
   - one element made of glass with a high index of refraction.

   That's quite a lot of speciality glass!

   The original Sonnar design was patented in Germany in 1929. A patent
   protects not just the patent holder's right to benefit from the
   innovation for a limited period (typically 20-25 years), but just as
   important gives everyone else the knowledge to benefit in the future,
   enabling faster technological development.

   If anything, 20 years is a very long protection period, given modern

   has very high level engineers, and also many invited foreign engineers

   produce STM AF motors and Youngnuo and some others implemented it in
   their lenses. This lens probably will be also nice, but I see some
   unusual price, in China are many manufacturers who producing 85/2

   have very high image quality, as some web-sites tested it and compared

   I think the ultimate test would be how it compares with the Canon EF
   85/1.8 and Nikon 85/1.8. At the same or lower price (depending on
   whether you can get the $420 china-only price), the native Canon/Nikon
   lenses support autofocus, are good optical performers, and have
   first-party compatibility with Nikon/Canon DSLRs.

   At its price point, it also competes with the used Nikon 85/1.4 AF-D.

   I don't see a niche for a $420-600 manual focus 85/2 unless it's
   stunningly good optically.

   Interesting mount choice. As much as I love shooting with DSLR, manual
   focusing on my Canon 5D is simply too painful, unless you use the live
   view screen. The mechanical design looks great, and it would be a great
   lens on mirrorless. Also, agree with most comments here about
   alternatives. The Canon 85/1.8 EF is only about 70g heavier, possible
   same sharpness if not sharper, has great ultrasonic manual/AF, and
   often available for about $400 new.

   Interesting comment, too. The 5D has no live view screen... only 5D
   Mark II or newer. The original 5D and the 5D Mark II can use EE-S
   screens, so focussing is a breeze with manual lenses. I kept my old 5D
   for the EE-S screen alone. It's fantastic.
   The mount choice is also nothing unusual as the original Sonnar Design
   was done for the 135mm film and therefor need a larger distance from
   the focal pane. Mirrorless would change that formula by some margins,
   so the effort would be higher to copy that for Sony or others.

   It's difficult to tell what the build quality or cosmetic finish is

   But I think they made a big mistake by leaving the silver finish around

   Chinese adapters for lenses are the same. I own about 20 of them. The

   loose tolerance as do the bayonets which rarely lock-in well and
   securely. I compare an Olympus-made (Japan) adapter and there is no

   The price point of 600 USD is hard to justify considering the fact that
   you can buy a lens like the Meike 85mm f1.8 (a pretty sharp optic also
   equipped with AF) for a little more than 150 USD of the eBay. I'm using
   it with the official Canon EF adapter on the EOS R and I love the
   images coming out of it and the autofocus is working great (it's not
   the fastest or quietest I've ever seen but it gets the job done).

   While I certainly like the prospect of more native RF lenses reaching

   stopping down to get as sharp as the center, but since most of the
   photos I've taken with have a blurred background it wasn't a problem
   for me.

   So, if this lens can produce the same level of sharpness in its corners

   Meike. Only time will tell after we get to see more samples.

   Are there such things as Apochromatic elements? I assume they mean to

   There are apochromatic groups (made of at least three elements cemented

   compressed than SooC). Not sure I like the Bokeh balls tho...

   'three elements made of lanthanum glass' (i.e. glass that contains

   I rather like the bokeh and sharpness. The model doesn't look too keen
   on being photographed in all of the shots though. The silver version
   looks rather posh : )

   Suspicions arise that most comment will be about AF EF 85mm lenses that
   are slower and cost a fifth of USD599, but we'll see.

   I started with a Minolta 85/2 and A7s ... these lenses remind me of
   that & you can do a lot with such a combo.

   Really like the design. Interesting lens!
   Just change the middle ring colour to orange and here you have your
   E-mount signature line 😉

Xiaomi Mi Mix Alpha 5G will pack a 108MP camera and wrap-around 'Surround
Screen'

   Published Sep 24, 2019 | Brittany Hillen

   Xiaomi has officially introduced its Mi Mix Alpha, a 5G concept phone
   featuring a 'true' bezel-free experience. The phone has a massive
   180.6% screen-to-body ratio, meaning the display wraps around the edges
   of the phone and covers the majority of the device's rear panel.
   Similarly impressive is the device's 108MP camera with its 12032 x 9024
   pixel resolution.

   Xiaomi teased the Mi Mix Alpha's existence in early August at its
   Future Image Technology Communications Conference in Beijing. At the
   time, the company said it would be the first company to pack Samsung's
   108MP ISOCELL sensor into a smartphone, though it didn't provide any
   other details at the time.

     This is #MiMIXAlpha, a surround display 5G concept smartphone.
     Challenge the impossible, to make the future possible.

     — Xiaomi #MiMIXAlpha (@Xiaomi) September 24, 2019

   During its latest event today, Xiaomi introduced the camera that packs
   that sensor, its new Mix Mix Alpha with Surround Screen. This phone
   features aerospace titanium, a single power button on the top,
   pressure-sensitive sides, and a fingerprint sensor hidden underneath
   the display.

     Flip over #MiMIXAlpha and check out what happens.
     pic.twitter.com/q1wQNu4jnC
     — Xiaomi #MiMIXAlpha (@Xiaomi) September 24, 2019

   The Mi Mix Alpha is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+ chipset
   alongside 512GB of storage and 12GB of RAM. Joining the 108MP sensor is
   a secondary rear 12MP telephoto camera with dual PD focus and 2x
   optical zoom. The phone doesn't feature a traditional front 'selfie'
   camera due also having a display on the back of the handset -- the rear
   camera is, technically speaking, a front camera as well.
   [MiMix.jpeg]

   Xiaomi describes the Mi Mix Alpha as a '5G concept smartphone.'
   According to Engadget, the company plans to produce a small number of
   units for sale in China at 19,999 yuan (approx. $2800 / €2,550)
   starting in December, but the company's broader plans for the model,
   including international availability, are unclear at this time.

   the Nikon P1000 lens...?

   OK, maybe it is just me, because I don't see any utility in this
   design.

   A foldable phone makes some sense, because you end up with a much
   larger display screen when unfolded. But a "screen on both sides" phone
   doesn't seem to be useful for anything.

   There are lots of things people might pay more to get. Things like
   longer battery life, faster recharge time, better cameras, better
   screens, more durable bodies, etc. But I just don't think "screen on
   both sides" is one of those things.

   This is just a gimmick to show off something different.

   108mp on a 1/1.3" sensor? Heck, that would be like a thousand

   It looks like it has several cameras, probably computational

   The Suwon District Prosecutor's Office charged 11 people on Thursday

   I doubt that they can even recover development cost for this device.
   At $3,000 (after taxes) is pushing it beyond too far.
   These Chinese phone companies seem to have forgotten their roots.
   Cheaper phones and very competitive prices were the main factors behind
   their survival and then growth.
   It makes far more sense to stay with what has worked in sustaining your

   This camera is insane. Personally I wouldn't use a Chinese smartphone,
   but I would want that camera in my phone. The crop factor compared to
   1" cameras is only 1.3. It's as close to high-end standalone compact
   cameras as APS-H was to full frame. And the aperture is f1.69, meaning
   a full-frame equivalent aperture of f/6! This is the largest aperture
   on any phone ever.

   Hell, this lens has an aperture larger than that of APS-C kit lenses.

   Well, f/6 is larger than what APS-C kit lenses offer at the long end
   but for the wide-angle end (which is what the 1/1.3" camera on this
   phone offers), f/3.5 (actual) and f/5.3 (FF equiv.) is still slightly
   larger.

   But with image stacking (for DR and SNR), the smartphone likely leaves
   APS-C kit lenses in the dust for image quality in regard to the sensor.
   Lens performance might still be better on the kit lenses. And image
   stacking almost always leaves you with an 8-bit JPEG which limits
   post-processing options considerably.

   Canon Eos M Aps-c cameras have f/3.5 at 15mm, but at the same field of
   view (should be ≈16mm) it might be rather f/3.6. The latest Canon Aps-c
   DSLRs even just have f/4 at 18mm.
   And the Xiaomi Alpha is equivalent to f/3.7 OIS on a Canon Aps-c
   camera, so Kristinn is right.
   Xiaomi's lens could be much better than Canon's 15-45mm at 16mm. Many
   copies of the 15-45mm suffer from extreme field curvature and
   especially at f/3.5 the 15-45mm suffers from at least one soft edge.
   The 15-45mm also has distortion and vignetting.

   To my understanding a dust particle on a large lens will affect the
   image quality. So the same dust particle on such a small lens can ruin
   the image completely.

   What about »grease fingerprints« on the lens?

   B/c for now you only can flash out Xiaomi's firmware completely with

   Here is the good news, you may be able to flash out CCP Spyware from

   "Huawei confirms bootloader unlock for Mate 30 Pro"

   Xiaomi will always outsell the "brand names" in poorer countries

   For this price I prefer to get two excellent lenses honestly. I have
   just picked the 240mp pixelshift examples of the A7R 4 and all these
   megapixels are not really impressive tbh. You need a perfect lens to
   exploite this. And the exemple clearly shows the limits here : the lens
   can’t handle such resolutions. I doubt a smartphone lens can handle
   better.
   Pixel war is not the right path, when you reach some limit (let say 30
   mp is enough for 99,9% of poeple).

   Not at all. Just like the 35mm format which is firmly ingrained in our
   heads, same with the vacuum tube unit of measure for sensor size.

   Most smartphone sensors are of size 1/2.3 inch or less, so if Xiaomi's
   is 1/1.33, then it is much larger than the norm.

   In fact, 1/1.33 inch is most likely the largest sensor ever to be
   featured on a smartphone so far.

   Yeah, why don't they call it 3/4" so we can compare it to 4/3" or 1"?

   I was realizing the other day that sensor manufacturers have fallen
   into discrete sizes all 4/3x bigger image circles than the last:
   1/1.8 (9/16"), 1/1.33 (3/4"), 1", 4/3", APS-C (~16/9"), but then
   "full-frame" jumps up 3/2x bigger than APS-C (~8/3", The biggest jump
   in this series), then the medium formats go back to smaller jumps.

   Just for clarification: These are just the names(!) of the sensor

   sensor is NOT (2.3/1.33)² times as large as a 1/2.3" sensor, there is

   It is the diameter of the video vacuum tube which had a flat surface
   about the same size as the sensor. You will find almost all camera
   manufactures will also list the vertical and horizontal size in mm. In
   practice the diameter of most sensors is about 2/3rds that of the
   listed type value. At larger sensor sizes the trend is to use the
   corresponding film size, since video tubes were not made much larger
   than 4/3.

   The 108MP 1/1.33" ISOCELL sensor is 9.6 x 7.2mm with a 12mm diagonal
   and 4:3 format. Close to 16mm film. So relative to micro four thirds
   it's a 0.555x crop factor. Relative to Canon EF-S it's a 0.447 crop

   What's so hard about just listing width and height in whatever your
   unit of choice is?

   With video tube sizing, first you have to figure out what size the
   weird fraction actually is. (At least the numerators are normalized to
   1, but why are we even using fractions in the first place?) Then, you
   have to account for some fudge factor, and you *still* have no idea
   what the actual sensor dimensions are (just what diameter circle it
   roughly fits inside).

   But hey, according to this formula, my 20 year old scanner has a
   1/0.12" sensor! Who knew it was practically a large format camera?!
