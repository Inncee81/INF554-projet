Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program (EDSP) Overview

     * Program Overview
     * EDSP Approach
     * Public Participation

Program Overview

   [INS: T :INS] he Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program (EDSP)[INS: uses
   a  :INS] two tiered approach to screen pesticides, chemicals, and
   environmental contaminants for their potential effect on estrogen,
   androgen and thyroid hormone systems.[INS: The EDSP is outlined in two
   Federal Register Notices published in 1998. :INS]

   The EDSP is mandated to use validated methods for the screening and
   testing chemicals to identify potential endocrine disruptors, determine
   adverse effects, dose-response, assess risk and ultimately manage risk
   under current laws. These methods or assays allow EPA to identify and
   characterize the endocrine activity (specifically, estrogen, androgen
   and thyroid) of pesticides, commercial chemicals, and environmental
   contaminants.

Program History

   In the 1990's, some scientists proposed that certain chemicals might be
   disrupting the endocrine systems of humans and wildlife. A variety of
   chemicals have been found to disrupt the endocrine systems of animals
   in laboratory studies, and compelling evidence shows that endocrine
   systems of certain fish and wildlife have been affected by chemical
   contaminants, resulting in developmental and reproductive problems.

   Based on this and other evidence, Congress passed the Food Quality
   Protection Act (FQPA), which amended the Federal Food, Drug, and
   Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), and the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) Amendments
   in 1996. FQPA requires that EPA screen pesticide chemicals for their
   potential to produce effects similar to those produced by the female
   hormones (estrogen) in humans and gives EPA the authority to screen
   certain other chemicals and to include other endocrine effects.

   In October 1996, under the authority of the Federal Advisory Committee
   Act (FACA), EPA chartered a scientific advisory committee -- the
   Endocrine Disruptor Screening and Testing Advisory Committee (EDSTAC)
   -- to advise EPA on establishing a program to carry out Congress's
   directives. The EDSTAC committee members were charged with developing
   consensus-based recommendations for a scientifically defensible
   screening program that would provide EPA the necessary information to
   make regulatory decisions about the endocrine effects of
   chemicals. Over the course of two years, EDSTAC members thoroughly
   reviewed and discussed scientific information and sought the opinion of
   other experts and members of the public. EDSTAC's Final Report was
   presented to EPA in September 1998.

   milestones.

EDSP Approach

Related Links

     * EDSP in the 21st Century
     * How EPA uses information from the screening program

   The EDSP uses a tiered approach for screening chemicals. Under the
   tiered approach:
     * Tier 1 screening data is used to identify substances that have the
       potential to interact with the endocrine system. Chemicals that go
       through Tier 1 screening and are found to exhibit the potential to
       interact with the estrogen, androgen, or thyroid hormone systems
       will proceed to Tier 2 for testing.
     * Tier 2 testing data identifies any adverse endocrine-related
       effects caused by the substance, and establish a quantitative
       relationship between the dose and that adverse effect. The results
       of Tier 2 testing will be combined with other hazard information
       and exposure assessment on a given chemical resulting in the risk
       assessment. Risk assessments are used to inform risk mitigation
       measures, as necessary, and regulatory decisions concerning
       chemicals.

   As the EDSP screening and testing requirements mature into routine
   evaluations, the Agency intends to utilize the pesticide registration
   review process as the framework for managing its responsibilities
   regarding the endocrine screening of pesticides, and intends to
   eventually incorporate these requirements routinely into the pesticide
   registration review process.

   While EPA has discretionary authority to issue, at any time, testing
   orders requiring manufacturers to conduct Tier 1 assays, the Agency
   plans to assess the performance of the Tier 1 battery based on the test
   data received for the initial list (List 1) of chemicals before
   beginning to routinely issue orders to test additional chemicals. If
   EDSP data exist at the time of a pesticide’s registration review, the
   Agency will consider the data when it makes its Federal Insecticide,
   Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (3)(c)(5) finding under
   registration review.

   Key components of the EDSP include:
    1. Assay Validation
    2. Chemical Selection/Prioritization
    3. Policies and Procedures
    4. Use of High Throughput Screening and Computational Models

Public Participation

   EPA has involved the public, stakeholders, and has coordinated with
   international organizations in implementing EDSP. In October 1996,
   under the authority of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), EPA
   chartered a scientific advisory committee -- the Endocrine Disruptor
   Screening and Testing Advisory Committee (EDSTAC) -- to advise EPA on
   establishing a program to carry out Congress's directives.

   After EDSTAC completed its work and disbanded in 1998, EPA organized a
   Standardization and Validation Task Force (SVTF) consisting of
   representation from a broad range of sectors, including federal
   agencies, agrichemical companies, commodity chemical companies, and
   environmental and public health organizations to coordinate and conduct
   the scientific and technical work necessary to validate the screens and
   tests recommended by the EDSTAC.

   In 2001, SVTF was replaced by the Endocrine Disruptor Methods
   Validation Subcommittee (EDMVS), a subcommittee of an Advisory Council
   (NACEPT) established under the Federal Advisory Committee Act. As a
   charter member and co-chair of the Interagency Coordinating Committee
   on the Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM), EPA followed the
   interagency validation framework in the development and refinement of
   assays to reduce animal use, refine procedures involving animals to
   make them less stressful, and replace animals where scientifically
   appropriate.

   In addition to the ICCVAM approach to assay validation in the United
   States, EPA considered the European approach by the European Center for
   the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM), as well as the
   international approach by the Organization for Economic Co-operation
   and Development (OECD) since some screening assays involved a
   collaborative validation effort with OECD.

   In 2004, the Endocrine Disruptor Methods Validation Advisory Committee
   (EDMVAC) was formed to replace EDMVS. The EDMVAC continued to function
   like EDMVS by providing advice and recommendations to EPA on scientific
   and technical aspects of the Tier 1 screens and Tier 2 assays being
   considered for the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program.

   In 2007, the EDMVAC was disbanded, and the functions of this advisory
   committee were taken over by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and
   Rodenticide Act Science Advisory Panel (FIFRA SAP). The Panel provides
   scientific advice, information, and recommendations to the EPA
   Administrator on pesticides and pesticide related issues as to the
   impact on health and the environment of regulatory actions. The FIFRA
   SAP will continue to evaluate relevant scientific issues, protocols,
   data, and interpretations of the data for the assays during
   the validation process.

   EPA estimated that in 2015 in the United States, more food reached
   landfills and combustion facilities than any other single material in
   our everyday trash, at 22 percent of the amount landfilled and at 22
   percent of the amount combusted with energy recovery. Reducing food
   waste will help the United States address climate change, as 20 percent
   of total U.S. methane emissions come from landfills. By keeping
   wholesome and nutritious food in our communities and out of our
   landfills, we can help address the 42 million Americans that live in
   food insecure households.

U.S. 2030 Food Loss and Waste Reduction Goal

   On September 16, 2015, in alignment with Target 12.3 of the UN
   Sustainable Development Goals, Exit the United States Department of
   Agriculture (USDA) and EPA announced the first ever domestic goal to
   reduce food loss and waste by half by the year 2030. By taking action
   on the U.S. 2030 Food Loss and Waste Reduction goal (2030 FLW reduction
   goal), the United States can help feed the hungry, save money for
   families and businesses and protect the environment. Led by USDA and
   EPA, the federal government is seeking to work with communities,
   organizations and businesses along with our partners in state, tribal
   and local government to reduce food loss and waste by 50 percent over
   the next 15 years.

     __________________________________________________________________

Measuring the Success of the Goal

   To measure and describe progress against the goal, the following two
   different, but equally important, baselines were chosen for the 2030
   FLW reduction goal:
     * For food waste in the United States, EPA’s “Advancing Sustainable
       Materials Management: Facts and Figures” provides an estimate of
       the amount of food going to landfills and combustion with energy
       recovery from residences, commercial establishments (e.g. grocery
       stores and restaurants), and institutional sources (e.g. school
       cafeterias). Preconsumer food generated during the manufacturing
       and packaging of food products is not included in EPA's food waste
       estimates. Using the available data, 2010 was selected as a
       baseline at 218.9 pounds of food waste per person sent to landfills
       and combustion with energy recovery. The 2030 FLW reduction goal
       aims to reduce food waste going to landfills and combustion with
       energy recovery by 50 percent to 109.4 pounds per person.
     * For food loss in the United States, USDA’s Economic Research
       Service has estimated the amount of available food supply that went
       uneaten at the retail and consumer levels. In the baseline year of
       2010, food loss was 31 percent of the food supply, equaling 133
       billion pounds and an estimated value of $161.6 billion. The 2030
       FLW reduction goal aims to cut food loss at the retail and consumer
       level in half, by approximately 66 billion pounds.

   Over the next 15 years, we hope to see 50 percent reductions in both
   baseline measurements.

How Does EPA Plan to Take Action on the Goal?

   Working with USDA and partners in the states and tribes, EPA plans to
   secure action on the 2030 FLW reduction goal by working with leaders in
   the food system (e.g., private, government, nonprofit, academia, faith)
   to promote action and bring more successful interventions and tools to
   advance the sustainable management of food.

   EPA launched a Call to Action by Stakeholders page, which identifies
   current opportunities and challenges in reducing food loss and waste in
   the United States. EPA will continue to help facilitate discussion by
   co-hosting summits where leaders in various sectors can exchange ideas
   and identify needed actions, provide leadership and technical
   assistance, conduct outreach and share information, develop new tools,
   and celebrate the successes of stakeholders.

What is Sustainable Management of Food?

   Sustainable Management of Food is a systematic approach that seeks to
   reduce wasted food and its associated impacts over the entire life
   cycle, starting with the use of natural resources, manufacturing,
   sales, and consumption and ending with decisions on recovery or final
   disposal. EPA works to promote innovation and highlight the value and
   efficient management of food as a resource. Through the sustainable
   management of food, we can help businesses and consumers save money,
   provide a bridge in our communities for those who do not have enough to
   eat, and conserve resources for future generations. Building on the
   familiar concept of "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle," this approach shifts the
   view on environmental protection and more fully recognizes the impacts
   of the food we waste.

What is Wasted Food and Where Does it Come From?

   The term “wasted food” describes food that was not used for its
   intended purpose and is managed in a variety of ways, such as donation
   to feed people, creation of animal feed, composting, anaerobic
   digestion, or sending to landfills or combustion facilities. Examples
   include unsold food from retail stores; plate waste, uneaten prepared
   food, or kitchen trimmings from restaurants, cafeterias, and
   households; or by-products from food and beverage processing
   facilities. EPA uses the overarching term “wasted food” instead of
   “food waste” for food that was not used for its intended purpose
   because it conveys that a valuable resource is being wasted, whereas
   “food waste” implies that the food no longer has value and needs to be
   managed as waste.
     * Excess food refers to food that is recovered and donated to feed
       people.
     * Food waste refers to food such as plate waste (i.e., food that has
       been served but not eaten), spoiled food, or peels and rinds
       considered inedible that is sent to feed animals, to be composted
       or anaerobically digested, or to be landfilled or combusted with
       energy recovery.
     * Food loss refers to unused product from the agricultural sector,
       such as unharvested crops.

   EPA encourages anyone managing wasted food to reference the Food
   Recovery Hierarchy. When the higher levels of the hierarchy are no
   longer feasible, then the food waste left over should be put to
   beneficial use such as composted or sent to be broken down through
   anaerobic digestion. Additional resources on wasted food can be found
   at Further with Food: Center for Food Loss and Waste Solutions.Exit

     __________________________________________________________________

Why is Sustainable Management of Food Important?

   Wasted food is a growing problem in our modern society and an untapped
   opportunity. In 2015 alone, more than 39 million tons of food waste was
   generated, with only 5.3 percent diverted from landfills and
   incinerators for composting. EPA estimates that more food reaches
   landfills and incinerators than any other single material in our
   everyday trash, constituting 22 percent of discarded municipal solid
   waste. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)
   estimates that in 2010, 31 percent or 133 billion pounds of the 430
   billion pounds of food produced was not available for human consumption
   at the retail and consumer levels (i.e., one-third of the food
   available was not eaten).^1

   The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)
   estimated in 2011 that approximately one-third of all food produced for
   human consumption worldwide is lost or wasted.^2 Taking simple steps in
   your everyday life can make a difference in addressing this issue.
   Reducing wasted food is a triple win; it's good for the economy, for
   communities, and for the environment.

Saving Money

   When we waste food, we’re not just creating a problem, we’re also
   missing an opportunity to save businesses and consumers money:
     * Pay Less for Trash Pickup – Organizations might pay less for trash
       pickup by keeping wasted food out of the garbage. Some haulers
       lower fees if wasted food is separated from the trash and sent to a
       compost facility instead of the landfill.
     * Receive Tax Benefits by Donating – If you donate healthy, safe, and
       edible food to hungry people, your organization can claim tax
       benefits. The Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Act protects food donors
       from legal liability.
     * Waste Less and Spend Less – If you or your organization can find
       ways to prevent waste in the first place, you can spend less by
       buying only the food you will use. Preventing wasted food can also
       reduce energy and labor costs associated with throwing away good
       food.

   Top of Page

Helping People

   Preventing wasted food and recovering wholesome, nutritious food can
   help you make a difference in your community:
     * Feed People, Not Landfills – Instead of feeding landfills, we
       should be feeding people in our communities. You can donate a
       variety of foods to many different types of organizations. Contact
       Feeding America Exit or your local food rescue organizations for
       information about where you can donate and what types of food your
       local organization is able to accept.
     * Feed Children – In 2012, the U.S. Department of Agriculture
       National School Lunch Program provided nutritionally balanced,
       low-cost or free lunches to more than 31 million children each
       school day.^4 By redirecting food that would otherwise be wasted to
       homes and schools, we can help feed our country’s children.
     * Create Job Opportunities – Recovering and recycling wasted food
       through donation, salvaging, processing, industrial reuse, and
       composting strengthens infrastructure and creates jobs. Food
       recycling in these sectors employs more than 36,000 people,
       supporting local economies and promoting innovation.^5
     * Feed the World – According to the Food and Agriculture Organization
       of the United Nations, from 2012 to 2014 there were about 805
       million hungry people on earth. They predict that by eliminating
       food loss and wasted food we would have enough food to feed all the
       chronically undernourished. They also expect that we wouldn’t have
       to increase food production or put additional pressure on our
       natural resources to do so.^3

Conserving Resources

   Reducing wasted food does great things for the environment:
     * Reduce Methane from Landfills – When food goes to the landfill,
       it’s similar to tying food in a plastic bag. The nutrients in the
       food never return to the soil. The wasted food rots and produces
       methane gas.
     * Save Resources – Wasted food wastes the water, gasoline, energy,
       labor, pesticides, land, and fertilizers used to make the food.
       When we throw food in the trash, we’re throwing away much more than
       food.
     * ​Return Nutrients to the Soil – If you can’t prevent, reduce or
       donate wasted food, you can compost. By sending food scraps to a
       composting facility instead of to a landfill or composting at home,
       you’re helping make healthy soils. Adding compost to gardens,
       highway construction sites, and poor soils makes great things
       happen. Properly composted organics (wasted food and yard waste)
       improve soil health and structure, improve water retention, support
       more native plants, and reduce the need for fertilizers and
       pesticides.

Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program (EDSP) Overview

     * Program Overview
     * EDSP Approach
     * Public Participation

Program Overview

   [INS: T :INS] he Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program (EDSP)[INS: uses
   a  :INS] two tiered approach to screen pesticides, chemicals, and
   environmental contaminants for their potential effect on estrogen,
   androgen and thyroid hormone systems.[INS: The EDSP is outlined in two
   Federal Register Notices published in 1998. :INS]

   The EDSP is mandated to use validated methods for the screening and
   testing chemicals to identify potential endocrine disruptors, determine
   adverse effects, dose-response, assess risk and ultimately manage risk
   under current laws. These methods or assays allow EPA to identify and
   characterize the endocrine activity (specifically, estrogen, androgen
   and thyroid) of pesticides, commercial chemicals, and environmental
   contaminants.

Program History

   In the 1990's, some scientists proposed that certain chemicals might be
   disrupting the endocrine systems of humans and wildlife. A variety of
   chemicals have been found to disrupt the endocrine systems of animals
   in laboratory studies, and compelling evidence shows that endocrine
   systems of certain fish and wildlife have been affected by chemical
   contaminants, resulting in developmental and reproductive problems.

   Based on this and other evidence, Congress passed the Food Quality
   Protection Act (FQPA), which amended the Federal Food, Drug, and
   Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), and the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) Amendments
   in 1996. FQPA requires that EPA screen pesticide chemicals for their
   potential to produce effects similar to those produced by the female
   hormones (estrogen) in humans and gives EPA the authority to screen
   certain other chemicals and to include other endocrine effects.

   In October 1996, under the authority of the Federal Advisory Committee
   Act (FACA), EPA chartered a scientific advisory committee -- the
   Endocrine Disruptor Screening and Testing Advisory Committee (EDSTAC)
   -- to advise EPA on establishing a program to carry out Congress's
   directives. The EDSTAC committee members were charged with developing
   consensus-based recommendations for a scientifically defensible
   screening program that would provide EPA the necessary information to
   make regulatory decisions about the endocrine effects of
   chemicals. Over the course of two years, EDSTAC members thoroughly
   reviewed and discussed scientific information and sought the opinion of
   other experts and members of the public. EDSTAC's Final Report was
   presented to EPA in September 1998.

   View the interactive EDSP timeline for an overview of program
   milestones.

EDSP Approach

Related Links

     * EDSP in the 21st Century
     * How EPA uses information from the screening program

   The EDSP uses a tiered approach for screening chemicals. Under the
   tiered approach:
     * Tier 1 screening data is used to identify substances that have the
       potential to interact with the endocrine system. Chemicals that go
       through Tier 1 screening and are found to exhibit the potential to
       interact with the estrogen, androgen, or thyroid hormone systems
       will proceed to Tier 2 for testing.
     * Tier 2 testing data identifies any adverse endocrine-related
       effects caused by the substance, and establish a quantitative
       relationship between the dose and that adverse effect. The results
       of Tier 2 testing will be combined with other hazard information
       and exposure assessment on a given chemical resulting in the risk
       assessment. Risk assessments are used to inform risk mitigation
       measures, as necessary, and regulatory decisions concerning
       chemicals.

   As the EDSP screening and testing requirements mature into routine
   evaluations, the Agency intends to utilize the pesticide registration
   review process as the framework for managing its responsibilities
   regarding the endocrine screening of pesticides, and intends to
   eventually incorporate these requirements routinely into the pesticide
   registration review process.

   While EPA has discretionary authority to issue, at any time, testing
   orders requiring manufacturers to conduct Tier 1 assays, the Agency
   plans to assess the performance of the Tier 1 battery based on the test
   data received for the initial list (List 1) of chemicals before
   beginning to routinely issue orders to test additional chemicals. If
   EDSP data exist at the time of a pesticide’s registration review, the
   Agency will consider the data when it makes its Federal Insecticide,
   Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (3)(c)(5) finding under
   registration review.

   Key components of the EDSP include:
    1. Assay Validation
    2. Chemical Selection/Prioritization
    3. Policies and Procedures
    4. Use of High Throughput Screening and Computational Models

Public Participation

   EPA has involved the public, stakeholders, and has coordinated with
   international organizations in implementing EDSP. In October 1996,
   under the authority of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), EPA
   chartered a scientific advisory committee -- the Endocrine Disruptor
   Screening and Testing Advisory Committee (EDSTAC) -- to advise EPA on
   establishing a program to carry out Congress's directives.

   After EDSTAC completed its work and disbanded in 1998, EPA organized a
   Standardization and Validation Task Force (SVTF) consisting of
   representation from a broad range of sectors, including federal
   agencies, agrichemical companies, commodity chemical companies, and
   environmental and public health organizations to coordinate and conduct
   the scientific and technical work necessary to validate the screens and
   tests recommended by the EDSTAC.

   In 2001, SVTF was replaced by the Endocrine Disruptor Methods
   Validation Subcommittee (EDMVS), a subcommittee of an Advisory Council
   (NACEPT) established under the Federal Advisory Committee Act. As a
   charter member and co-chair of the Interagency Coordinating Committee
   on the Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM), EPA followed the
   interagency validation framework in the development and refinement of
   assays to reduce animal use, refine procedures involving animals to
   make them less stressful, and replace animals where scientifically
   appropriate.

   In addition to the ICCVAM approach to assay validation in the United
   States, EPA considered the European approach by the European Center for
   the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM), as well as the
   international approach by the Organization for Economic Co-operation
   and Development (OECD) since some screening assays involved a
   collaborative validation effort with OECD.

   In 2004, the Endocrine Disruptor Methods Validation Advisory Committee
   (EDMVAC) was formed to replace EDMVS. The EDMVAC continued to function
   like EDMVS by providing advice and recommendations to EPA on scientific
   and technical aspects of the Tier 1 screens and Tier 2 assays being
   considered for the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program.

   In 2007, the EDMVAC was disbanded, and the functions of this advisory
   committee were taken over by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and
   Rodenticide Act Science Advisory Panel (FIFRA SAP). The Panel provides
   scientific advice, information, and recommendations to the EPA
   Administrator on pesticides and pesticide related issues as to the
   impact on health and the environment of regulatory actions. The FIFRA
   SAP will continue to evaluate relevant scientific issues, protocols,
   data, and interpretations of the data for the assays during
   the validation process.

   EPA estimated that in 2015 in the United States, more food reached
   landfills and combustion facilities than any other single material in
   our everyday trash, at 22 percent of the amount landfilled and at 22
   percent of the amount combusted with energy recovery. Reducing food
   waste will help the United States address climate change, as 20 percent
   of total U.S. methane emissions come from landfills. By keeping
   wholesome and nutritious food in our communities and out of our
   landfills, we can help address the 42 million Americans that live in
   food insecure households.

U.S. 2030 Food Loss and Waste Reduction Goal

   On September 16, 2015, in alignment with Target 12.3 of the UN
   Sustainable Development Goals, Exit the United States Department of
   Agriculture (USDA) and EPA announced the first ever domestic goal to
   reduce food loss and waste by half by the year 2030. By taking action
   on the U.S. 2030 Food Loss and Waste Reduction goal (2030 FLW reduction
   goal), the United States can help feed the hungry, save money for
   families and businesses and protect the environment. Led by USDA and
   EPA, the federal government is seeking to work with communities,
   organizations and businesses along with our partners in state, tribal
   and local government to reduce food loss and waste by 50 percent over
   the next 15 years.

     __________________________________________________________________

Measuring the Success of the Goal

   To measure and describe progress against the goal, the following two
   different, but equally important, baselines were chosen for the 2030
   FLW reduction goal:
     * For food waste in the United States, EPA’s “Advancing Sustainable
       Materials Management: Facts and Figures” provides an estimate of
       the amount of food going to landfills and combustion with energy
       recovery from residences, commercial establishments (e.g. grocery
       stores and restaurants), and institutional sources (e.g. school
       cafeterias). Preconsumer food generated during the manufacturing
       and packaging of food products is not included in EPA's food waste
       estimates. Using the available data, 2010 was selected as a
       baseline at 218.9 pounds of food waste per person sent to landfills
       and combustion with energy recovery. The 2030 FLW reduction goal
       aims to reduce food waste going to landfills and combustion with
       energy recovery by 50 percent to 109.4 pounds per person.
     * For food loss in the United States, USDA’s Economic Research
       Service has estimated the amount of available food supply that went
       uneaten at the retail and consumer levels. In the baseline year of
       2010, food loss was 31 percent of the food supply, equaling 133
       billion pounds and an estimated value of $161.6 billion. The 2030
       FLW reduction goal aims to cut food loss at the retail and consumer
       level in half, by approximately 66 billion pounds.

   Over the next 15 years, we hope to see 50 percent reductions in both
   baseline measurements.

How Does EPA Plan to Take Action on the Goal?

   Working with USDA and partners in the states and tribes, EPA plans to
   secure action on the 2030 FLW reduction goal by working with leaders in
   the food system (e.g., private, government, nonprofit, academia, faith)
   to promote action and bring more successful interventions and tools to
   advance the sustainable management of food.

   EPA launched a Call to Action by Stakeholders page, which identifies
   current opportunities and challenges in reducing food loss and waste in
   the United States. EPA will continue to help facilitate discussion by
   co-hosting summits where leaders in various sectors can exchange ideas
   and identify needed actions, provide leadership and technical
   assistance, conduct outreach and share information, develop new tools,
   and celebrate the successes of stakeholders.

What is Sustainable Management of Food?

   Sustainable Management of Food is a systematic approach that seeks to
   reduce wasted food and its associated impacts over the entire life
   cycle, starting with the use of natural resources, manufacturing,
   sales, and consumption and ending with decisions on recovery or final
   disposal. EPA works to promote innovation and highlight the value and
   efficient management of food as a resource. Through the sustainable
   management of food, we can help businesses and consumers save money,
   provide a bridge in our communities for those who do not have enough to
   eat, and conserve resources for future generations. Building on the
   familiar concept of "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle," this approach shifts the
   view on environmental protection and more fully recognizes the impacts
   of the food we waste.

What is Wasted Food and Where Does it Come From?

   The term “wasted food” describes food that was not used for its
   intended purpose and is managed in a variety of ways, such as donation
   to feed people, creation of animal feed, composting, anaerobic
   digestion, or sending to landfills or combustion facilities. Examples
   include unsold food from retail stores; plate waste, uneaten prepared
   food, or kitchen trimmings from restaurants, cafeterias, and
   households; or by-products from food and beverage processing
   facilities. EPA uses the overarching term “wasted food” instead of
   “food waste” for food that was not used for its intended purpose
   because it conveys that a valuable resource is being wasted, whereas
   “food waste” implies that the food no longer has value and needs to be
   managed as waste.
     * Excess food refers to food that is recovered and donated to feed
       people.
     * Food waste refers to food such as plate waste (i.e., food that has
       been served but not eaten), spoiled food, or peels and rinds
       considered inedible that is sent to feed animals, to be composted
       or anaerobically digested, or to be landfilled or combusted with
       energy recovery.
     * Food loss refers to unused product from the agricultural sector,
       such as unharvested crops.

   EPA encourages anyone managing wasted food to reference the Food
   Recovery Hierarchy. When the higher levels of the hierarchy are no
   longer feasible, then the food waste left over should be put to
   beneficial use such as composted or sent to be broken down through
   anaerobic digestion. Additional resources on wasted food can be found
   at Further with Food: Center for Food Loss and Waste Solutions.Exit

Why is Sustainable Management of Food Important?

   Wasted food is a growing problem in our modern society and an untapped
   opportunity. In 2015 alone, more than 39 million tons of food waste was
   generated, with only 5.3 percent diverted from landfills and
   incinerators for composting. EPA estimates that more food reaches
   landfills and incinerators than any other single material in our
   everyday trash, constituting 22 percent of discarded municipal solid
   waste. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)
   estimates that in 2010, 31 percent or 133 billion pounds of the 430
   billion pounds of food produced was not available for human consumption
   at the retail and consumer levels (i.e., one-third of the food
   available was not eaten).^1

   The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)
   estimated in 2011 that approximately one-third of all food produced for
   human consumption worldwide is lost or wasted.^2 Taking simple steps in
   your everyday life can make a difference in addressing this issue.
   Reducing wasted food is a triple win; it's good for the economy, for
   communities, and for the environment.

Saving Money

   When we waste food, we’re not just creating a problem, we’re also
   missing an opportunity to save businesses and consumers money:
     * Pay Less for Trash Pickup – Organizations might pay less for trash
       pickup by keeping wasted food out of the garbage. Some haulers
       lower fees if wasted food is separated from the trash and sent to a
       compost facility instead of the landfill.
     * Receive Tax Benefits by Donating – If you donate healthy, safe, and
       edible food to hungry people, your organization can claim tax
       benefits. The Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Act protects food donors
       from legal liability.
     * Waste Less and Spend Less – If you or your organization can find
       ways to prevent waste in the first place, you can spend less by
       buying only the food you will use. Preventing wasted food can also
       reduce energy and labor costs associated with throwing away good
       food.

   Top of Page

Helping People

   Preventing wasted food and recovering wholesome, nutritious food can
   help you make a difference in your community:
     * Feed People, Not Landfills – Instead of feeding landfills, we
       should be feeding people in our communities. You can donate a
       variety of foods to many different types of organizations. Contact
       Feeding America Exit or your local food rescue organizations for
       information about where you can donate and what types of food your
       local organization is able to accept.
     * Feed Children – In 2012, the U.S. Department of Agriculture
       National School Lunch Program provided nutritionally balanced,
       low-cost or free lunches to more than 31 million children each
       school day.^4 By redirecting food that would otherwise be wasted to
       homes and schools, we can help feed our country’s children.
     * Create Job Opportunities – Recovering and recycling wasted food
       through donation, salvaging, processing, industrial reuse, and
       composting strengthens infrastructure and creates jobs. Food
       recycling in these sectors employs more than 36,000 people,
       supporting local economies and promoting innovation.^5
     * Feed the World – According to the Food and Agriculture Organization
       of the United Nations, from 2012 to 2014 there were about 805
       million hungry people on earth. They predict that by eliminating
       food loss and wasted food we would have enough food to feed all the
       chronically undernourished. They also expect that we wouldn’t have
       to increase food production or put additional pressure on our
       natural resources to do so.^3

Conserving Resources

   Reducing wasted food does great things for the environment:
     * Reduce Methane from Landfills – When food goes to the landfill,
       it’s similar to tying food in a plastic bag. The nutrients in the
       food never return to the soil. The wasted food rots and produces
       methane gas.
     * Save Resources – Wasted food wastes the water, gasoline, energy,
       labor, pesticides, land, and fertilizers used to make the food.
       When we throw food in the trash, we’re throwing away much more than
       food.
     * ​Return Nutrients to the Soil – If you can’t prevent, reduce or
       donate wasted food, you can compost. By sending food scraps to a
       composting facility instead of to a landfill or composting at home,
       you’re helping make healthy soils. Adding compost to gardens,
       highway construction sites, and poor soils makes great things
       happen. Properly composted organics (wasted food and yard waste)
       improve soil health and structure, improve water retention, support
       more native plants, and reduce the need for fertilizers and
       pesticides.
