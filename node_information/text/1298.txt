The course

Duration: 8 to 16 weeks

   Physicians who have been successful in the competitive examinations are
   assigned to their place of work within the academic inspectorates and
   undergo 8 to 16 weeks of training at the EHESP before being made
   permanent. The content and duration of the training course depends on
   each person’s professional experience within the education system.
   Training is based on a mix of on-the-job and classroom training and
   aims to:
     * Improve medical expertise (learning difficulties, psychopathology
       of children and adolescents, occupational medicine) and public
       health expertise in the area of childhood and adolescence
     * Acquire the methods and tools necessary to promote health from a
       decision support and project management perspective
     * Understanding the political, institutional and legal context in
       which the profession operates

   The individual training programmes consist of 7 teaching units lasting
   1 to 3 weeks organised between October and June:
     * Institutional, political and legal context
     * Health screening in the school environment
     * Epidemiology and applied statistics
     * Care and child welfare policies
     * Health promotion concepts and methods
     * Student environment and health
     * Communication and professional practices

   Certification involves the submission and oral defence of a piece of
   written work. Certification is one of the conditions for permanency.

   ECTS (European Credits Transfer System) credits can be earned through
   certification with a view to obtaining a masters degree.

Eligibility

   Competitive recruitment based on school file followed by an interview,
   open to holders of a degree, certificate or qualification required to
   practice as a physician and to those who are licensed to practice
   medicine in France.

   (*) Please note that, in the 2006 to 2008 competitive examinations, a
   distinction was made between candidates with less than 8 years of
   service and those with 8 years or more experience in the public
   service, with 2/3 of all positions being reserved for the latter. Those
   who successfully passed the examinations and who could provide proof of
   at least 3 years experience in school medicine were exempted from
   training. This temporary provision was removed in 2008.

The job

   The profession of school physician was established by the order of 27
   November 1991, which confirmed the transfer of school medicine to the
   Ministry of Education.

   The school physician practices in geographical zones encompassing
   primary schools, collèges and lycées (secondary school). He or she
   forms part of the educational community which is explained by his or
   her dual competence:
     * Clinical/medical expertise available to all students irrespective
       of their disability or illness, in support of educational
       achievement
     * Expertise in the field of public health through his or her
       assistance in determining the health needs of students and through
       the achievement of national and regional objectives for public
       health and child and adolescent health promotion and prevention.

   The physician acts as a:
     * Clinician when he examines students, does health screening, makes a
       diagnosis and prescribes appropriate counselling,
     * Medical expert when he suggests changes to make school life easier
       or when he intervenes in a situation covered by physician patient
       confidentiality (mistreatment, suspicion of sexual abuse)
     * Expert in public health when he identifies risk factors and
       contributes to the implementation of a health policy within the
       institutions
     * Educator when he deals with students or their families within the
       context of the health education programme
     * Instructor when he trains staff within the education system on the
       impact of health problems on academic performance and what they are
       required to do.

   The physician ensures that patient confidentiality is administered, in
   all professionally applicable situations, in a fashion that complies
   with all legal and ethical requirements and that recognises the
   potential scientific importance of information gleaned within the
   context of health education projects.

   The school physician relies on numerous colleagues and partners due to
   his position at the interface between the education and healthcare
   systems.

   The school physician career development structure permits access to
   managerial positions at département (inspection académique – academic
   in

The course

Duration: 8 to 16 weeks

   Physicians who have been successful in the competitive examinations are
   assigned to their place of work within the academic inspectorates and
   undergo 8 to 16 weeks of training at the EHESP before being made
   permanent. The content and duration of the training course depends on
   each person’s professional experience within the education system.
   Training is based on a mix of on-the-job and classroom training and
   aims to:
     * Improve medical expertise (learning difficulties, psychopathology
       of children and adolescents, occupational medicine) and public
       health expertise in the area of childhood and adolescence
     * Acquire the methods and tools necessary to promote health from a
       decision support and project management perspective
     * Understanding the political, institutional and legal context in
       which the profession operates

   The individual training programmes consist of 7 teaching units lasting
   1 to 3 weeks organised between October and June:
     * Institutional, political and legal context
     * Health screening in the school environment
     * Epidemiology and applied statistics
     * Care and child welfare policies
     * Health promotion concepts and methods
     * Student environment and health
     * Communication and professional practices

   Certification involves the submission and oral defence of a piece of
   written work. Certification is one of the conditions for permanency.

   ECTS (European Credits Transfer System) credits can be earned through
   certification with a view to obtaining a masters degree.

Eligibility

   Competitive recruitment based on school file followed by an interview,
   open to holders of a degree, certificate or qualification required to
   practice as a physician and to those who are licensed to practice
   medicine in France.

   (*) Please note that, in the 2006 to 2008 competitive examinations, a
   distinction was made between candidates with less than 8 years of
   service and those with 8 years or more experience in the public
   service, with 2/3 of all positions being reserved for the latter. Those
   who successfully passed the examinations and who could provide proof of
   at least 3 years experience in school medicine were exempted from
   training. This temporary provision was removed in 2008.

The job

   The profession of school physician was established by the order of 27
   November 1991, which confirmed the transfer of school medicine to the
   Ministry of Education.

   The school physician practices in geographical zones encompassing
   primary schools, collèges and lycées (secondary school). He or she
   forms part of the educational community which is explained by his or
   her dual competence:
     * Clinical/medical expertise available to all students irrespective
       of their disability or illness, in support of educational
       achievement
     * Expertise in the field of public health through his or her
       assistance in determining the health needs of students and through
       the achievement of national and regional objectives for public
       health and child and adolescent health promotion and prevention.

   The physician acts as a:
     * Clinician when he examines students, does health screening, makes a
       diagnosis and prescribes appropriate counselling,
     * Medical expert when he suggests changes to make school life easier
       or when he intervenes in a situation covered by physician patient
       confidentiality (mistreatment, suspicion of sexual abuse)
     * Expert in public health when he identifies risk factors and
       contributes to the implementation of a health policy within the
       institutions
     * Educator when he deals with students or their families within the
       context of the health education programme
     * Instructor when he trains staff within the education system on the
       impact of health problems on academic performance and what they are
       required to do.

   The physician ensures that patient confidentiality is administered, in
   all professionally applicable situations, in a fashion that complies
   with all legal and ethical requirements and that recognises the
   potential scientific importance of information gleaned within the
   context of health education projects.

   The school physician relies on numerous colleagues and partners due to
   his position at the interface between the education and healthcare
   systems.

   The school physician career development structure permits access to
   managerial positions at département (inspection académique – academic
   in
