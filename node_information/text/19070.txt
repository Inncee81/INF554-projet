                              acebook-secrets/

   Facebook, as many of us already know, has a few dirty secrets. While it
    offers undeniable benefits, such as being able to easily communicate
      and stay up to date with your friends and family, and providing a
    platform to share your views, it does come with a price. Facebook has
   been widely known to spy on its users, for example, and participate in
                        many other privacy invasions.

         But how much do these things actually affect us? Are these
   practices enough to stop us from using it? The following 5 secrets may
                            just help you decide.

                              1. Double Dealing

   As many of us have already learned watching the popular 2010 film about
      the creation of Facebook, The Social Network, Zuckerberg stole a
       program designed by the Winklevoss brothers, originally called
     harvardconnnection.com. He was supposed to be helping them develop
   their social network, but instead borrowed many of their ideas for his
     own project, thefacebook.com. Perhaps worse than the theft itself,
    Zuckerberg later bragged of his deception and how he benefitted from
                                     it.

                           2. Emotional Contagion

     In 2014 Facebook launched a secret experiment under Cornell and the
    University of California to intentionally manipulate the emotions of
     689,003 of its users. Details and findings of this experiment were
   published in an article titled “Experimental Evidence Of Massive-Scale
   Emotional Contagion Through Social Networks,” which was published in
     the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the
                          United States of America.

     To summarize the study, it effectively showed how Facebook has the
   ability to deliberately make you feel good or bad by altering what you
  are seeing in your newsfeed — a conclusion that reveals the frightening
     amount of power Facebook holds and leads one to wonder how Facebook
                              impacts us today.

    The authors found that when they manipulated user feeds to reduce the
     positive expressions displayed by others, “people produced fewer
   positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were
                 reduced, the opposite pattern occurred.”

   The results of this study suggested “emotions expressed by others on
   Facebook influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence
    for massive-scale contagion via social networks.” One has to wonder
     what they are now currently doing with that information that we are
                                 unaware of.

                            3. Facebook Messenger

     In 2014 Facebook took advantage of the time people were spending on
     their smartphones by creating a separate messaging application that
    gave the company access to its users phones. The privacy settings in
     this app allow it to access text messages and call records, record
       audio and video, and read data such as email and phone numbers.

   Even though Facebook assures us that it won’t use these permissions to
    spy on its users, the company was already caught tracking users that
                       were fully logged out in 2011.

                               4. Under Review

      It is easy to forget, or simply fail to consider, just how big an
   operation Facebook really is, and how much manpower is required to keep
   it running. Over 1.18 billion people use Facebook every single day and
      about 4 billion pieces of content need to be reviewed for what is
      considered objectionable material. Despite reaping huge profits,
      Facebook outsources this important and delicate task of reviewing
           content to third world workers making just $1 an hour.

    Workers have reported having to see extremely disturbing content on a
      regular basis, such as “pedophilia, necrophilia, beheadings and
suicides.” You may be thinking, it’s a dirty job and someone’s gotta do
        it, but suffering such emotional duress clearly warrants more
                              appropriate pay.

       Even more disturbing, the employees hired for this job are from
    outsourcing firms and are hired without any security checks. There is
      also nothing stopping them from downloading and saving any of the
                            content they review.

                         5. Not So Private After All

   You may or may not have noticed that Facebook’s privacy settings are
    complex and change frequently. Many believe that this is intentional,
     making it easier for the company to mine unprotected personal data.
    Facebook claims that any information it receives is stored in a black
    box, only used to enhance target advertising and serve more relevant
     content, yet a 2010 Wall Street Journal investigation revealed that
    Facebook was actually making the personal data of its users directly
                          available to advertisers.

     Take a look at this video Anonymous put together of these findings.
