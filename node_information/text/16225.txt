Multi-Select & Bulk Editing

   Multi-Select is amazing. With Divi, you can press Cmd or Ctrl and click
   to select multiple elements on the page at once. You can then edit
   these elements at the same time, changing their style and content
   together or moving them to different locations on the page as a group.
   Learn More Play Video

Find & Replace Styles

   Make sweeping changes across your entire page instantly, saving you
   hours upon hours of editing time. Using find and replace allows you to
   change any design value, such as colors or fonts, across the entire
   page or within specific locations. Instead of opening up each element
   individually and changing colors over and over again, just find and
   replace across the entire document. It's incredible.
   Learn More Play Video

Magic Color Manager

   Divi automatically remembers your recently used colors and stores them
   for easy access. It also displays your own customizable color pallet.
   In addition, Divi creates a unique extended color pallet using advanced
   color theory to give you a range of suggested colors that will look
   great on your page.
   Learn More Play Video

Copy & Paste Styles

   The ability to copy and paste styles across elements is an absolute
   game changer. In Divi, anything can be copied from one element and
   pasted onto another. You can copy individual settings, groups of
   settings or even copy an element's entire design and transfer it to
   another element on the page. No need to open up design settings and
   edit things over and over again. Just copy and paste.
   Learn More Play Video

Extend-able Styles

   Divi's extend styles functionality brings design efficiency to a whole
   new level. If you have a design style that you just created, and you
   want to use that elsewhere on the page, or even across the entire page,
   you can simply extend that style automatically to your desired
   location. Update hundreds of elements at once! Control exactly where
   and to which elements your styles should be extended to. For example,
   let's say you just crafted the perfect box shadow and border style for
   your images, but you have dozens of images on the page. You can extend
   that style to the rest of your images instantly!

Divi Quick Actions

   The Divi quick action system is an all-in-one finder and doer. Need
   help finding a setting? Looking for some clarification on how something
   works in the builder? Just type to search through our help videos and
   all available Divi options. Perform advanced actions like adding
   elements or loading layouts. Quickly jump to different parts of the
   builder with a few keystrokes, or even jump to different pages and
   different WordPress admin areas. It's super fast and a huge time saver.

   instantly and appear inside your design! Drag and drop entire Divi
   layouts to import them directly. Drag in new web fonts, text files,

Keyboard Shortcuts

   Keyboard shorcuts are the key to ultimate efficiency. Divi comes with a

   up their work flow significantly. Once you get the hang of using
   shortcuts, you will wonder how you ever lived without them!

   Divi Keyboard Shortcuts

Quick Access To Element Styling

   Divi elements come with a huge array of design settings. However, Divi
   also makes it easy to search and filter through these settings and to
   quickly jump to your already-modified settings. Viewing modified styles
   gives you a list of all settings that are currently active so that you
   don't have to hunt through the full array of options. It's very similar
   to Google Chrome's "view computer styles" filter.
   Learn More Play Video

Search-able Settings

   All Divi settings are search-able. Instead of hunting through different
   options groups to find the particular option you are looking for, you
   can just start typing when you open a settings pop-up and the results
   will be filtered accordingly. Even if you know where to find an option,
   searching for it is faster. No need to click into different tabs and
   groups. If you want to edit your background color just type "background
   color" and the option will appear right away.
   Learn More Play Video

Filterable Settings & Search

   Settings within Divi are also filterable. Applying different search
   filters will trim down the results and help you find what you are
   looking for. Search results can be filtered to organize settings into
   different groups such as modified styles, responsive styles, and hover
   styles.

Great to have live people to help

   First time working with anything other than WP preloaded themes. I am a
   very basic beginner, and self taught so it is wonderful to have support
   at hand as I usually sit all alone and struggle at odd hours of day
   feeling really dumb. The forums are good because there's a range of
   people on there too and usually asking my same questions, and I imagine
   they will even get better as number of users increases. All in all
   using this has cut my trial and error time before getting up and
   running waaay shorter. I love how they make recommendations for plugins
   and then provide those plugins so I don't have to go searching around
   the world for something that integrates. Really nice to have live
   people to work with!

Worth every penny

   Not only are their products worth every penny, their customer service
   is OUTSTANDING! There was a small technical issue with my order
   (bonuses went to spam) and they honored & took accountability for their
   part in it. Refreshing in a world of horrible customer service where
   companies put THEIR responsibility on the customer. Thank you! We are
   customers for life & will tell the world (:

Elegant Themes Support ROCKS!

   I own a website, but I am not a developer and know nothing about
   coding. Whenever I have a Divi update or customization need, Elegant
   Themes support always helps me and resolves my issues. I have worked
   with some of the support techs for so long that we feel like we know
   each other.

     “When Divi came out, it was a game-changer for me. It allowed me to
     become familiar with one theme and learn how to do anything I could
     possibly think of with that one theme. Divi has allowed me to be the
     freelancer I always wanted to be. Now my entire business is shaped
     around being a Divi designer.”

   "Our firm has used Divi as the base framework for over 40 client
   websites and we continue to use Divi on a regular basis due to the
   amazing flexibility that Divi provides our clients. As a web design
   firm we (Valorous Circle) can work with most any theme or design; we
   work with Divi because it saves us time and that translates into
   savings for our clients. Our clients love Divi because they have the
   ability to create amazing web page layouts using the Divi Page Builder
   without needing to understand the complexities of CSS, HTML or PHP. All
   of this combined with Elegant Themes' support and active user community
   make Divi and Elegant Themes a great choice for us and our clients."
   Loretta Gale

   "We started our Small Business Initiative program to help Small
   Businesses get online in August 2013. When Divi was released in
   December 2013, it rapidly became our go-to template for all WordPress
   sites. During the past year, we have only had one client who wanted a
   different template. Divi is so easy to customize, that most clients
   can't even tell it's the Divi theme. Then, the builder is so easy for
   my clients to use, it's a snap to turn over to them to manage all their
   own content. And, they rarely mess it up. (However, it has happened,
   but Divi is so easy to admin, we can quickly hop online and adjust/fix
   any mistakes they've made). I am a huge fan. HUGE."
   Andrew Palmer

   "After discovering Elegant Themes and using pretty much all of the
   themes on my client sites - it is clear to say that my business is
   built on Elegant Themes. Around 7 months ago, I discovered Divi and
   used my friend and client Pat Sharp as a test on Divi. Since then, I
   have transitioned around 40% of my clients to Divi and continue to beat
   the drum on the theme - its flexibility allows me and my developers to
   build a site in a few days rather than a few weeks and it offers
   everything a customer could need, out of the box mobile ready and if we
   do need to make amendments to the CSS to change the way it looks we
   can! Simply put, without Divi, I would not have a business and I cannot
   imagine not using it on every site I build."

Frequently Asked Questions

     *

Why choose Elegant Themes?
       ElegantThemes is a leader in WordPress development. We have been
       building WordPress Themes for 10 years and tend one of the largest
       customer bases of any company in the market. Our designs are
       beautiful, functional and affordable. With dozens of themes for
       $89, you are getting access to one of the largest collections of
       premium themes available for half the price that our competitors
       pay for a single theme!
     *

Can I use the themes and plugins on multiple websites?
       Yes, you are free to use our themes on as many websites as you
       like. We do not place any restrictions on how many times you can
       download or use a theme, nor do we limit the number of domains that
       you can install our themes to.
     *

What if I change my mind and want a refund?
       We offer no-questions-asked refunds to all customers within 30 days
       of your purchase. If you are not satisfied with our product, then
       simply send us an email and we will refund your purchase right
       away. Our goal has always been to create a happy, thriving
       community. If you are not thrilled with the product or are not
       enjoying the experience, then we have no interest in forcing you to
       stay an unhappy member.
     *

Can I upgrade to a different package after signing up?
       Yes, you can upgrade at any time after signing up. When you log in
       as a "personal" subscriber, you will see a notice regarding your
       current package and instructions on how to upgrade.
     *

Can I use your themes on WordPress.com
       Our products will work with the WordPress.com Business Plan, which
       allows the installation of third party themes and plugins.
     *

Can I use Elegant Themes products for my clients?
       Yes, you are free to use our themes to build websites for your
       clients. We love providing developers with beautiful and functional
       design choices for their clients!
     *

What happens if I cancel my subscription?
       If you cancel your subscription, then your account will remain
       active for the remainder of your one year term. After that, you
       will lose access to the members area and all new themes, theme
       updates and tech support. You may continue using the themes that
       you have already downloaded forever.
     *

Can I buy a single product instead of becoming a full member?
       Our themes are only available as part of the membership. However, I
       think you will find that $89 is an incredible deal, even if you
       only intend to use a single theme from our collection. $89 is less
       than the price you would pay for a single theme at many other theme
       shops, and here you get access to a lot more!
     *

Will your themes work with third party plugins?
       While our themes should work fine with most plugins, there is no
       way for us to test and guarantee that all plugins will work. All we
       can guarantee is that our themes are coded excellently and that any
       plugin that also uses coding best practices should play well with
       our themes. If you run into any problems, let us know so that we
       can look into it. We also offer a 30 day money back guarantee just
       in case you discover that one of your third party plugins isn't
       working and you decide to use a different theme instead.
     *

Do I need to install the Divi Builder plugin with the Divi Theme?
       Nope, the Divi theme and the Extra theme both come with the Divi
       Builder packaged as part of the theme. There is no need to use the
       Divi Builder plugin if you are planning to use one of these two
       themes. If you ever decide to switch to a different theme after
       having built your website with Divi or Extra, the Divi Builder
       plugin can be installed so that you can continue to enjoy the power
       of the Divi Builder with your third party theme.

Elegant Themes Support ROCKS!

   I own a website, but I am not a developer and know nothing about
   coding. Whenever I have a Divi update or customization need, Elegant
   Themes support always helps me and resolves my issues. I have worked
   with some of the support techs for so long that we feel like we know
   each other.

Perfect in product and support

   The Themes Divi and Extra are really professional and easy to use. But
   simply the best is the support. Always friendly, highest quality
   solutions and fast in requests. Perfect to work with. Thanks.

Worth every penny

   Not only are their products worth every penny, their customer service
   is OUTSTANDING! There was a small technical issue with my order
   (bonuses went to spam) and they honored & took accountability for their
   part in it. Refreshing in a world of horrible customer service where
   companies put THEIR responsibility on the customer. Thank you! We are
   customers for life & will tell the world (:

     “When Divi came out, it was a game-changer for me. It allowed me to
     become familiar with one theme and learn how to do anything I could
     possibly think of with that one theme. Divi has allowed me to be the
     freelancer I always wanted to be. Now my entire business is shaped
     around being a Divi designer.”

   "Our firm has used Divi as the base framework for over 40 client
   websites and we continue to use Divi on a regular basis due to the
   amazing flexibility that Divi provides our clients. As a web design
   firm we (Valorous Circle) can work with most any theme or design; we
   work with Divi because it saves us time and that translates into
   savings for our clients. Our clients love Divi because they have the
   ability to create amazing web page layouts using the Divi Page Builder
   without needing to understand the complexities of CSS, HTML or PHP. All
   of this combined with Elegant Themes' support and active user community
   make Divi and Elegant Themes a great choice for us and our clients."

   December 2013, it rapidly became our go-to template for all WordPress
   sites. During the past year, we have only had one client who wanted a
   different template. Divi is so easy to customize, that most clients
   can't even tell it's the Divi theme. Then, the builder is so easy for
   my clients to use, it's a snap to turn over to them to manage all their
   own content. And, they rarely mess it up. (However, it has happened,
   but Divi is so easy to admin, we can quickly hop online and adjust/fix
   any mistakes they've made). I am a huge fan. HUGE."
   Andrew Palmer

   "After discovering Elegant Themes and using pretty much all of the
   themes on my client sites - it is clear to say that my business is
   built on Elegant Themes. Around 7 months ago, I discovered Divi and
   used my friend and client Pat Sharp as a test on Divi. Since then, I
   have transitioned around 40% of my clients to Divi and continue to beat
   the drum on the theme - its flexibility allows me and my developers to
   build a site in a few days rather than a few weeks and it offers
   everything a customer could need, out of the box mobile ready and if we
   do need to make amendments to the CSS to change the way it looks we
   can! Simply put, without Divi, I would not have a business and I cannot
   imagine not using it on every site I build."

Frequently Asked Questions

     *

Why choose Elegant Themes?
       ElegantThemes is a leader in WordPress development. We have been
       building WordPress Themes for 11 years and tend one of the largest
       customer bases of any company in the market. Our designs are
       beautiful, functional and affordable. With dozens of themes for
       $89, you are getting access to one of the largest collections of
       premium themes available for half the price that our competitors
       pay for a single theme!
     *

Can I use the themes and plugins on multiple websites?
       Yes, you are free to use our themes on as many websites as you
       like. We do not place any restrictions on how many times you can
       download or use a theme, nor do we limit the number of domains that
       you can install our themes to.
     *

What if I change my mind and want a refund?
       We offer no-questions-asked refunds to all customers within 30 days
       of your purchase. If you are not satisfied with our product, then
       simply send us an email and we will refund your purchase right
       away. Our goal has always been to create a happy, thriving
       community. If you are not thrilled with the product or are not
       enjoying the experience, then we have no interest in forcing you to
       stay an unhappy member.
     *

Can I upgrade to a different package after signing up?
       Yes, you can upgrade at any time after signing up. When you log in
       as a "personal" subscriber, you will see a notice regarding your
       current package and instructions on how to upgrade.
     *

Can I use your themes on WordPress.com
       Our products will work with the WordPress.com Business Plan, which
       allows the installation of third party themes and plugins.
     *

Can I use Elegant Themes products for my clients?
       Yes, you are free to use our themes to build websites for your
       clients. We love providing developers with beautiful and functional
       design choices for their clients!
     *

What happens if I cancel my subscription?
       If you cancel your subscription, then your account will remain
       active for the remainder of your one year term. After that, you
       will lose access to the members area and all new themes, theme
       updates and tech support. You may continue using the themes that
       you have already downloaded forever.
     *

Can I buy a single product instead of becoming a full member?
       Our themes are only available as part of the membership. However, I
       think you will find that $89 is an incredible deal, even if you
       only intend to use a single theme from our collection. $89 is less
       than the price you would pay for a single theme at many other theme
       shops, and here you get access to a lot more!
     *

Will your themes work with third party plugins?
       While our themes should work fine with most plugins, there is no
       way for us to test and guarantee that all plugins will work. All we
       can guarantee is that our themes are coded excellently and that any
       plugin that also uses coding best practices should play well with
       our themes. If you run into any problems, let us know so that we
       can look into it. We also offer a 30 day money back guarantee just
       in case you discover that one of your third party plugins isn't
       working and you decide to use a different theme instead.
     *

Do I need to install the Divi Builder plugin with the Divi Theme?
       Nope, the Divi theme and the Extra theme both come with the Divi
       Builder packaged as part of the theme. There is no need to use the
       Divi Builder plugin if you are planning to use one of these two
       themes. If you ever decide to switch to a different theme after
       having built your website with Divi or Extra, the Divi Builder
       plugin can be installed so that you can continue to enjoy the power
       of the Divi Builder with your third party theme.

Multi-Select & Bulk Editing

   Multi-Select is amazing. With Divi, you can press Cmd or Ctrl and click
   to select multiple elements on the page at once. You can then edit
   these elements at the same time, changing their style and content
   together or moving them to different locations on the page as a group.
   Learn More Play Video

Find & Replace Styles

   Make sweeping changes across your entire page instantly, saving you
   hours upon hours of editing time. Using find and replace allows you to
   change any design value, such as colors or fonts, across the entire
   page or within specific locations. Instead of opening up each element
   individually and changing colors over and over again, just find and
   replace across the entire document. It's incredible.
   Learn More Play Video

Magic Color Manager

   Divi automatically remembers your recently used colors and stores them
   for easy access. It also displays your own customizable color pallet.
   In addition, Divi creates a unique extended color pallet using advanced
   color theory to give you a range of suggested colors that will look
   great on your page.
   Learn More Play Video

Copy & Paste Styles

   The ability to copy and paste styles across elements is an absolute
   game changer. In Divi, anything can be copied from one element and
   pasted onto another. You can copy individual settings, groups of
   settings or even copy an element's entire design and transfer it to
   another element on the page. No need to open up design settings and
   edit things over and over again. Just copy and paste.
   Learn More Play Video

Extend-able Styles

   Divi's extend styles functionality brings design efficiency to a whole
   new level. If you have a design style that you just created, and you
   want to use that elsewhere on the page, or even across the entire page,
   you can simply extend that style automatically to your desired
   location. Update hundreds of elements at once! Control exactly where
   and to which elements your styles should be extended to. For example,
   let's say you just crafted the perfect box shadow and border style for
   your images, but you have dozens of images on the page. You can extend
   that style to the rest of your images instantly!

Divi Quick Actions

   The Divi quick action system is an all-in-one finder and doer. Need
   help finding a setting? Looking for some clarification on how something
   works in the builder? Just type to search through our help videos and
   all available Divi options. Perform advanced actions like adding
   elements or loading layouts. Quickly jump to different parts of the
   builder with a few keystrokes, or even jump to different pages and
   different WordPress admin areas. It's super fast and a huge time saver.

   shortcuts, you will wonder how you ever lived without them!

Quick Access To Element Styling

   Divi elements come with a huge array of design settings. However, Divi
   also makes it easy to search and filter through these settings and to
   quickly jump to your already-modified settings. Viewing modified styles
   gives you a list of all settings that are currently active so that you
   don't have to hunt through the full array of options. It's very similar
   to Google Chrome's "view computer styles" filter.
   Learn More Play Video

Search-able Settings

   All Divi settings are search-able. Instead of hunting through different
   options groups to find the particular option you are looking for, you
   can just start typing when you open a settings pop-up and the results
   will be filtered accordingly. Even if you know where to find an option,
   searching for it is faster. No need to click into different tabs and
   groups. If you want to edit your background color just type "background
   color" and the option will appear right away.
   Learn More Play Video

Filterable Settings & Search

   Settings within Divi are also filterable. Applying different search
   filters will trim down the results and help you find what you are
   looking for. Search results can be filtered to organize settings into
   different groups such as modified styles, responsive styles, and hover
   styles.

The best support I have ever had

   The best support I have ever had. Very quick to respond, usually in a
   couple of hours and always get a fix within a few attempts. Would
   recommend them highly.

Great to have live people to help

   First time working with anything other than WP preloaded themes. I am a
   very basic beginner, and self taught so it is wonderful to have support
   at hand as I usually sit all alone and struggle at odd hours of day
   feeling really dumb. The forums are good because there's a range of
   people on there too and usually asking my same questions, and I imagine
   they will even get better as number of users increases. All in all
   using this has cut my trial and error time before getting up and
   running waaay shorter. I love how they make recommendations for plugins
   and then provide those plugins so I don't have to go searching around
   the world for something that integrates. Really nice to have live
   people to work with!

   of this combined with Elegant Themes' support and active user community
   make Divi and Elegant Themes a great choice for us and our clients."

   "We started our Small Business Initiative program to help Small
   Businesses get online in August 2013. When Divi was released in
   December 2013, it rapidly became our go-to template for all WordPress
   sites. During the past year, we have only had one client who wanted a
   different template. Divi is so easy to customize, that most clients
   can't even tell it's the Divi theme. Then, the builder is so easy for
   my clients to use, it's a snap to turn over to them to manage all their
   own content. And, they rarely mess it up. (However, it has happened,
   but Divi is so easy to admin, we can quickly hop online and adjust/fix
   any mistakes they've made). I am a huge fan. HUGE."

   "After discovering Elegant Themes and using pretty much all of the
   themes on my client sites - it is clear to say that my business is
   built on Elegant Themes. Around 7 months ago, I discovered Divi and
   used my friend and client Pat Sharp as a test on Divi. Since then, I
   have transitioned around 40% of my clients to Divi and continue to beat
   the drum on the theme - its flexibility allows me and my developers to
   build a site in a few days rather than a few weeks and it offers
   everything a customer could need, out of the box mobile ready and if we
   do need to make amendments to the CSS to change the way it looks we
   can! Simply put, without Divi, I would not have a business and I cannot
   imagine not using it on every site I build."

Frequently Asked Questions

     *

Why choose Elegant Themes?
       ElegantThemes is a leader in WordPress development. We have been
       building WordPress Themes for 10 years and tend one of the largest
       customer bases of any company in the market. Our designs are
       beautiful, functional and affordable. With dozens of themes for
       $89, you are getting access to one of the largest collections of
       premium themes available for half the price that our competitors
       pay for a single theme!
     *

Can I use the themes and plugins on multiple websites?
       Yes, you are free to use our themes on as many websites as you
       like. We do not place any restrictions on how many times you can
       download or use a theme, nor do we limit the number of domains that
       you can install our themes to.
     *

What if I change my mind and want a refund?
       We offer no-questions-asked refunds to all customers within 30 days
       of your purchase. If you are not satisfied with our product, then
       simply send us an email and we will refund your purchase right
       away. Our goal has always been to create a happy, thriving
       community. If you are not thrilled with the product or are not
       enjoying the experience, then we have no interest in forcing you to
       stay an unhappy member.
     *

Can I upgrade to a different package after signing up?
       Yes, you can upgrade at any time after signing up. When you log in
       as a "personal" subscriber, you will see a notice regarding your
       current package and instructions on how to upgrade.
     *

Can I use your themes on WordPress.com
       Our products will work with the WordPress.com Business Plan, which
       allows the installation of third party themes and plugins.
     *

Can I use Elegant Themes products for my clients?
       Yes, you are free to use our themes to build websites for your
       clients. We love providing developers with beautiful and functional
       design choices for their clients!
     *

What happens if I cancel my subscription?
       If you cancel your subscription, then your account will remain
       active for the remainder of your one year term. After that, you
       will lose access to the members area and all new themes, theme
       updates and tech support. You may continue using the themes that
       you have already downloaded forever.
     *

Can I buy a single product instead of becoming a full member?
       Our themes are only available as part of the membership. However, I
       think you will find that $89 is an incredible deal, even if you
       only intend to use a single theme from our collection. $89 is less
       than the price you would pay for a single theme at many other theme
       shops, and here you get access to a lot more!
     *

Will your themes work with third party plugins?
       While our themes should work fine with most plugins, there is no
       way for us to test and guarantee that all plugins will work. All we
       can guarantee is that our themes are coded excellently and that any
       plugin that also uses coding best practices should play well with
       our themes. If you run into any problems, let us know so that we
       can look into it. We also offer a 30 day money back guarantee just
       in case you discover that one of your third party plugins isn't
       working and you decide to use a different theme instead.
     *

Do I need to install the Divi Builder plugin with the Divi Theme?
       Nope, the Divi theme and the Extra theme both come with the Divi
       Builder packaged as part of the theme. There is no need to use the
       Divi Builder plugin if you are planning to use one of these two
       themes. If you ever decide to switch to a different theme after
       having built your website with Divi or Extra, the Divi Builder
       plugin can be installed so that you can continue to enjoy the power
       of the Divi Builder with your third party theme.

Elegant Themes Support ROCKS!

   I own a website, but I am not a developer and know nothing about
   coding. Whenever I have a Divi update or customization need, Elegant
   Themes support always helps me and resolves my issues. I have worked
   with some of the support techs for so long that we feel like we know
   each other.

I love the new support method

   sorted. Thank you...Shows the value of experience on Support side and
   the value of going with a company that constantly develop, improve and

Perfect in product and support

   The Themes Divi and Extra are really professional and easy to use. But
   simply the best is the support. Always friendly, highest quality

Worth every penny

   Not only are their products worth every penny, their customer service
   is OUTSTANDING! There was a small technical issue with my order
   (bonuses went to spam) and they honored & took accountability for their
   part in it. Refreshing in a world of horrible customer service where
   companies put THEIR responsibility on the customer. Thank you! We are
   customers for life & will tell the world (:

     “When Divi came out, it was a game-changer for me. It allowed me to
     become familiar with one theme and learn how to do anything I could
     possibly think of with that one theme. Divi has allowed me to be the
     freelancer I always wanted to be. Now my entire business is shaped
     around being a Divi designer.”

   "Our firm has used Divi as the base framework for over 40 client
   websites and we continue to use Divi on a regular basis due to the
   amazing flexibility that Divi provides our clients. As a web design
   firm we (Valorous Circle) can work with most any theme or design; we
   work with Divi because it saves us time and that translates into
   savings for our clients. Our clients love Divi because they have the
   ability to create amazing web page layouts using the Divi Page Builder
   without needing to understand the complexities of CSS, HTML or PHP. All
   of this combined with Elegant Themes' support and active user community
   make Divi and Elegant Themes a great choice for us and our clients."
   Loretta Gale

   "We started our Small Business Initiative program to help Small
   Businesses get online in August 2013. When Divi was released in
   December 2013, it rapidly became our go-to template for all WordPress
   sites. During the past year, we have only had one client who wanted a
   different template. Divi is so easy to customize, that most clients
   can't even tell it's the Divi theme. Then, the builder is so easy for
   my clients to use, it's a snap to turn over to them to manage all their
   own content. And, they rarely mess it up. (However, it has happened,
   but Divi is so easy to admin, we can quickly hop online and adjust/fix
   any mistakes they've made). I am a huge fan. HUGE."
   Andrew Palmer

   "After discovering Elegant Themes and using pretty much all of the
   themes on my client sites - it is clear to say that my business is
   built on Elegant Themes. Around 7 months ago, I discovered Divi and
   used my friend and client Pat Sharp as a test on Divi. Since then, I
   have transitioned around 40% of my clients to Divi and continue to beat
   the drum on the theme - its flexibility allows me and my developers to
   build a site in a few days rather than a few weeks and it offers
   everything a customer could need, out of the box mobile ready and if we
   do need to make amendments to the CSS to change the way it looks we
   can! Simply put, without Divi, I would not have a business and I cannot
   imagine not using it on every site I build."

Frequently Asked Questions

     *

Why choose Elegant Themes?
       ElegantThemes is a leader in WordPress development. We have been
       building WordPress Themes for 11 years and tend one of the largest
       customer bases of any company in the market. Our designs are
       beautiful, functional and affordable. With dozens of themes for
       $89, you are getting access to one of the largest collections of
       premium themes available for half the price that our competitors
       pay for a single theme!
     *

Can I use the themes and plugins on multiple websites?
       Yes, you are free to use our themes on as many websites as you
       like. We do not place any restrictions on how many times you can
       download or use a theme, nor do we limit the number of domains that
       you can install our themes to.
     *

What if I change my mind and want a refund?
       We offer no-questions-asked refunds to all customers within 30 days
       of your purchase. If you are not satisfied with our product, then
       simply send us an email and we will refund your purchase right
       away. Our goal has always been to create a happy, thriving
       community. If you are not thrilled with the product or are not
       enjoying the experience, then we have no interest in forcing you to
       stay an unhappy member.
     *

Can I upgrade to a different package after signing up?
       Yes, you can upgrade at any time after signing up. When you log in
       as a "personal" subscriber, you will see a notice regarding your
       current package and instructions on how to upgrade.
     *

Can I use your themes on WordPress.com
       Our products will work with the WordPress.com Business Plan, which
       allows the installation of third party themes and plugins.
     *

Can I use Elegant Themes products for my clients?
       Yes, you are free to use our themes to build websites for your
       clients. We love providing developers with beautiful and functional
       design choices for their clients!
     *

What happens if I cancel my subscription?
       If you cancel your subscription, then your account will remain
       active for the remainder of your one year term. After that, you
       will lose access to the members area and all new themes, theme
       updates and tech support. You may continue using the themes that
       you have already downloaded forever.
     *

Can I buy a single product instead of becoming a full member?
       Our themes are only available as part of the membership. However, I
       think you will find that $89 is an incredible deal, even if you
       only intend to use a single theme from our collection. $89 is less
       than the price you would pay for a single theme at many other theme
       shops, and here you get access to a lot more!
     *

Will your themes work with third party plugins?
       While our themes should work fine with most plugins, there is no
       way for us to test and guarantee that all plugins will work. All we
       can guarantee is that our themes are coded excellently and that any
       plugin that also uses coding best practices should play well with
       our themes. If you run into any problems, let us know so that we
       can look into it. We also offer a 30 day money back guarantee just
       in case you discover that one of your third party plugins isn't
       working and you decide to use a different theme instead.
     *

Do I need to install the Divi Builder plugin with the Divi Theme?
       Nope, the Divi theme and the Extra theme both come with the Divi
       Builder packaged as part of the theme. There is no need to use the
       Divi Builder plugin if you are planning to use one of these two
       themes. If you ever decide to switch to a different theme after
       having built your website with Divi or Extra, the Divi Builder
       plugin can be installed so that you can continue to enjoy the power
       of the Divi Builder with your third party theme.
