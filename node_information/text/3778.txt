Career[edit]

2008-2010: Until One, Collaborations, and DJ Mag entry[edit]

   In late 2008, Sebastian Ingrosso, Steve Angello, and Axwell formed the
   Swedish House Mafia with Eric Prydz not joining, saying he is a control
   freak and cannot abide with collaborations even with close friends.^[4]
   Around this time Swedish House Mafia released two songs, "Get Dumb" and
   "Leave the World Behind", however these weren't credited under the
   group name. Ingrosso himself collaborated with David Guetta on the
   songs "Everytime We Touch" and "How Soon is Now" for Guetta's albums
   Pop Life and One Love respectively. In 2009 Ingrosso made his debut on
   the DJ Mag top 100 DJs, charting at number 25, the highest new entry
   that year.^[5] In 2010, he released his debut album with Swedish House
   Mafia named Until One. This followed the release of two success single
   "One (Your Name)" (featuring Pharrell Williams) and "Miami 2 Ibiza"
   (featuring Tinie Tempah). The album also contained solo work by
   Sebastian Ingrosso such as the songs "Kidos" and "Meich", plus his
   remix of "Silvia" by Miike Snow. In addition, Ingrosso made his
   Tomorrowland debut with Swedish House Mafia and achieved his peaked
   positions on the DJ Mag poll at number 10 while Swedish House Mafia
   debuted at number 23.^[6]

2011-2012: Until Now, and Breakthrough solo singles[edit]

   In May 2011, Sebastian Ingrosso began work on his second album with
   Swedish House Mafia with the release of the single Save the World
   featuring vocals from Swedish singer John Martin. In the summer Swedish
   House Mafia again performed at Tomorrowland and released two more songs
   in the winter named "Antidote" and "Greyhound". In early 2012 Ingrosso
   released one of his most notable solo tracks with Swedish DJ Alesso
   (who at the time had recently signed to Ingrosso's record label) and
   OneRepublic front man Ryan Tedder. The song named "Calling (Lose My
   Mind)" became a commercial success certifying 2× Platinum in
   Sweden.^[7] In July, Swedish House Mafia performed at Tomorrowland for
   the third consecutive year, this time heading the event and opening
   Night 2. In September following a successful summer of live
   performances, Swedish House Mafia released their most commercially
   successful track "Don't You Worry Child", again featuring the vocal of
   John Martin which reach number 1 in Sweden, Australia, and the UK and
   was a multiplatinum song in many countries. The same month Sebastian
   Ingrosso released his collaboration with Tommy Trash entitled "Reload",
   this along with "Calling (Lose My Mind)" would feature on Swedish House
   Mafia's second studio/compilation album Until Now.

   Following the break up Ingrosso returned to his solo music and the song
   "Reload", adding in the vocals of favourite collaborator John Martin
   and renaming the song to "Reload (Take My Hand)". This allowed the song
   to become a commercial success certifying in Sweden and the UK and
   becoming a chart hit in many countries. In July, Sebastian Ingrosso
   made his Tomorrowland debut as a solo artist, performing the main stage
   on Night 1.^[8] Despite the break up of the Swedish House Mafia,
   Ingrosso collaborated with Axwell on "Roar" for the Monsters University
   Soundtrack in late 2013. In October, Ingrosso made a new peak on the DJ
   Mag top 100 DJs achieving number 18.^[9]

   Veronica Sandra Karin Maggio^[1] was born on 15 March 1981 in Uppsala,
   Sweden,^[2] to a Swedish mother and an Italian father.^[3] She attended
   Uppsala Musikklasser primary school and went on to study music at
   Bolandgymnasiet (Boland highschool) in Uppsala and was also the lead
   singer of the group Solitude, with other members Daniel Fredriksson,
   Marcus "Gonzo" Berglund, Karl Jansson, and Kristoffer Hoflund.

   In October 2010, Maggio had a son with Nils Tull of the band
   Hoffmaestro & Chraa.^[4]

Music career[edit]

2006–07: Vatten och bröd[edit]

   In March 2006, Maggio released her debut single "Dumpa mig" (Dump Me);
   the video for the single soon became the hit of the week on TV stations
   like ZTV. Her second single was the song "Nöjd?" (Satisfied?). She
   signed a contract with Universal Music and went on a tour in Summer
   2006 as part of Sommarkrysset, a Swedish live-music program on TV4.

   Maggio's debut album is called Vatten och bröd (Water and Bread). The
   lyrics and music were written by Stefan Gräslund, except for the rap
   verse in "Vi har, vi har" (We Have, We Have), which was written by
   rapper Kristoffer Malmsten (known as LKM). “I started writing in
   English when I was really young, but I just wasn’t good enough.” she
   said in 2016, “I was mimicking things I’d heard and I wasn’t able to
   find my own identity.”^[5]

2008–10: Och vinnaren är...[edit]

   On 26 March 2008, Maggio released another album – Och vinnaren är...
   (And the Winner Is...), which she wrote and recorded together with
   Oskar Linnros.^[6]

   In 2009 she enjoyed some success in Norway and Denmark with her single
   "Måndagsbarn" (Monday child) reaching 1st position at the Norwegian
   charts,^[7] as well as being A-listed on the Norwegian radio station
   NRK P3, and the album Och vinnaren är... broke into the top 40 albums
   list.

   In 2010 Maggio worked with Petter on his new single "Längesen" (Long
   Time ago) from his album "En räddare i nöden" (A saviour when in need).

2011–12: Satan i gatan[edit]

   In 2011 she released the album Satan i gatan, on which she collaborated
   with amongst others Christian Walz and Markus Krunegård. The album was
   a success and reached the 1st place in both Swedish and Norwegian music
   charts, as did the single "Jag kommer". During the summer and autumn of
   2011, Maggio toured through Denmark, Norway and Sweden,^[8] and again
   in 2012 at Ruisrockfestival in Finland.

2013–present[edit]

   On 4 October 2013, Maggio released her fourth album, Handen i fickan
   fast jag bryr mig, which is produced by Salem Al Fakir, Vincent Pontare
   and Magnus Lidehäll. The album includes a duet with Swedish singer
   Håkan Hellström, "Hela huset".

   She released her fifth album, Den första är alltid gratis (The First
   One's Always Free) in 2016. A critic describes it as "another pop
   triumph, combining pacing, urgent melodies, with uplifting, hook-heavy
   choruses."^[9] Maggio said in an interview: “I really like the
   happy/sad combination.” “There’s a lot of melancholy in it, but there’s
   also something euphoric… I tended to write darker lyrics because it was
   always nighttime. I was still in the process of playing live lots, so I
   sort of surprised myself."

Awards[edit]

   Maggio has won many Swedish music awards. In 2007 she received "Årets
   Nykomling" (Newcomer of the year) at the Grammisgalan.^[10]

   In 2011 Maggio won the Rockbjörnen (rock bear) prize for both "Årets
   kvinnliga liveartist" (Live female artist of the year) and "Årets
   svenska låt" (Swedish song of the year) which was presented by Swedish
   newspaper Aftonbladet.^[11]

   At the 2012 Grammisgalan Maggio was named winner in the categories
   "Årets pop" (Pop of the year), "Årets kompositör" (composer of the
   year) and "Årets textförfattare" (Lyricist of the year).^[12] The
   latter two were won together with Christian Walz.

   French artist Vianney wrote a song about Maggio titled "Veronica".^[13]

   Unleashed is a Swedish death metal band that was formed in 1989 by
   Johnny Hedlund in Stockholm. Common lyrical themes found in the band's
   music include Viking culture, recollection of a pre-Christian world,
   and Norse folklore. A number of their recent songs also contain
   references to J. R. R. Tolkien. Unleashed (along with Dismember,
   Entombed and Grave) is considered one of the "big four" of Swedish
   death metal.^[1]^[2]

Biography[edit]

   Unleashed was founded in 1989 by vocalist and bassist Johnny Hedlund.
   Unleashed recorded demos "Revenge" and "Utter Dark", which got them a
   record deal with the German label Century Media Records. In 1991, the
   band released their debut studio album, Where No Life Dwells, and
   toured with Morbid Angel in Europe and the United States.

   In 1992, Unleashed released their second studio album, Shadows in the
   Deep, including a cover version of Venom's "Countess Bathory". Their
   next studio albums were Across the Open Sea in 1993 and Victory in
   1995, the latter being the last album which guitarist Fredrik Lindgren
   played on. Lindgren began to focus strongly on playing punk rock, so
   Unleashed replaced him with Fredrik Folkare, who played guitar on the
   fifth Unleashed studio album Warrior in 1997.
   Bassist/vocalist Johnny Hedlund, founder of the band

   The band went on hiatus after 7–8 years of recording and touring. They
   were concentrating on life outside the music business, their musical
   side projects, and studying. After a reissue of the band's classics in
   2002, the band released a new album called Hell's Unleashed in the same
   year, and they began to tour once again. This was also the same year
   Hedlund had come under scrutiny because of allegations that he was a
   Nazi sympathizer. Dave Grohl of Foo Fighters initially had intended to
   approach Hedlund, hoping he would contribute lead vocals to one of the
   songs for his Probot metal project, but the album producer, Matt
   Sweeney, discouraged him from doing so because of the rumors of
   Hedlund's alleged sympathies.^[3] Hedlund quickly branded these
   accusations as false and stated, Unleashed praises nature, beast and
   man. Man....regardless of background, place of birth or color of the
   skin.^[4]^[5]

   In 2004, Unleashed released their seventh studio album, Sworn
   Allegiance. In October 2006, the band released their eighth studio
   album, Midvinterblot. Unleashed toured Europe in November 2006 as part
   of the Masters of Death tour, with Grave, Dismember, and Entombed. On
   February and March 2007, they headlined a North American tour with
   Krisiun and Belphegor. June 2008 saw the release of their ninth studio
   album entitled Hammer Battalion.

   On July 24, 2009 Unleashed signed a contract with German label Nuclear
   Blast Records for the release of their tenth album entitled As
   Yggdrasil Trembles. In the press statement the band said, "We are very
   much looking forward to this new cooperation! The recording of the
   album is scheduled for October/November this year."^[6]

   In summer 2010 Unleashed was part of the Summer Breeze Open Air and the
   With Full Force heavy metal festivals in Germany.^[7] The band's 11th
   studio album Odalheim was released also on Nuclear Blast Records in
   April 2012, and their twelfth record Dawn of the Nine was released
   April 24, 2015.

Biography[edit]

1987–1998[edit]

   Born in Hovmantorp, in the southern Swedish province Småland, at the
   age of thirteen Perrelli joined a local dansband, Bengt Ingvars,^[2]
   which became "Bengt Ingvars med Charlotte".^[2] After finishing her
   compulsory school education, Perrelli moved from Hovmantorp to the
   neighbouring town of Växjö where she attended the High School of
   Performing Arts.^[3] She also became the lead singer of a band named
   Kendix.^[4]

   In 1994, Perrelli started singing with the well-established dansband
   Anders Engbergs. After two albums, Perrelli left them and joined the
   highly successful Wizex in 1997.^[4] Larger venues and professional
   management increased the band's reputation. In 1998, the band was
   nominated for a Swedish Grammis (Grammy) for the album Mot nya mål, and
   the album Tusen och en natt that went gold.^[5]

   From 1997 to 1998 Perrelli starred as the instructor Millan Svensson in
   the Swedish soap opera Vita lögner.^[6]

1999–2000[edit]

   After winning that year's national Melodifestivalen, Perrelli went to
   Jerusalem to compete as the Swedish representative for the 1999
   Eurovision Song Contest on 29 May with her song "Take Me to Your
