               Leaving the Paris Agreement Would Be Indefensible

   I was Obama’s chief climate negotiator. Whether to stay in the
   agreement is not a close call.

   Reports suggest that President Trump has finally decided to pull out of
   the 2015 Paris climate agreement after many weeks of a back and forth
   administration tug-of-war. Trump himself has tweeted that he will make
   an official announcement in the coming days. I have followed the ups
   and downs of this debate more closely than most, and weighed in where I
   could, because, as the U.S. special envoy for climate change, I led the
   U.S. negotiating effort from the start of the Obama administration
   through and beyond the Paris talks. Along with many others, I have
   tried to defend and preserve the U.S. role in Paris not because of the
   personal blood, sweat, and tears that my team and I invested (well,
   mostly not), but because we understand the climate threat, we recognize
   what’s at stake, and we know the giant step forward that the Paris
   Agreement represented.

   The president evidently intends to follow his own misguided calculus. A
   decision to withdraw would be indefensible. It is important to
   understand why and to consider what we need to do next.

   The administration’s withdrawal caucus has argued that the Paris
   Agreement is a bad deal for the United States, but they don’t have even
   a passing knowledge of the facts. The truth is, Paris was a landmark
   achievement, establishing a durable global climate regime for the first
   time since the original “framework convention” was agreed to in 1992.

   The Paris Agreement is ambitious, universal transparent, and balanced.
   It brings China, India, and other developing countries fully into the
   regime. It combines strong, aggregate goals with a “bottom-up”
   structure in which countries decide their emissions targets for
   themselves and then continually update those targets on five-year
   cycles. Yet Paris boxes no one in; all are urged to aim high, but
   targets are not legally binding. It succeeded with strong U.S.
   leadership every step of the way. The entire world has signed on, save
   only Syria and Nicaragua. It appears that the president now means to
   expand that group of two to include the United States of America.

   Pulling out of Paris would cause serious diplomatic damage. The
   countries of the world care about climate change. They see it as a
   profound threat. They recognize there is no way to meet that global
   threat without an effective global regime. And they understand that the
   Paris regime cannot work in the long run if the world’s indispensable
   power has left the table. The president’s exit from Paris would be read
   as a kind of “drop dead” to the rest of the world. Bitterness, anger,
   and disgust would be the wages of this careless act. As Ronald Reagan’s
   secretary of state, George Shultz, said recently about Paris, “[g]lobal
   statecraft relies on trust, reputation and credibility, which can be
   all too easily squandered. …[I]f America fails to honor a global
   agreement that it helped forge, the repercussions will undercut our
   diplomatic priorities across the globe.”

   What is perhaps most astonishing about the possibility of withdrawal,
   given Trump’s business background, is that such a decision would fly in
   the face of nearly across-the-board support for Paris among top
   American companies, in sectors ranging from oil and gas to retail,
   chemicals, utilities, agriculture, finance, information, and autos.
   Business leaders know climate change is real. They know Paris is an
   agreement they can work with. They know having U.S. negotiators at the
   table to protect their interests on matters like intellectual property
   and trade is crucial. They know that the transition to clean energy is
   one of the biggest economic plays of this century, that climate change
   is a major driver of this transition, that the United States is
   perfectly positioned to lead with our unmatched culture of innovation,
   but that opting out of Paris will undermine this opportunity to expand
   markets, create jobs and build wealth.

   Against these potent reasons to stay in the Paris Agreement, the
   withdrawal crowd has offered up bogus legal arguments that
   misunderstand the agreement, but they are just excuses. The real reason
   for their opposition is that they reject the importance of containing
   climate change in the first place. Remember OMB Director Mike
   Mulvaney’s words: “we're not spending money on [climate change]
   anymore; we consider that to be a waste.”

   But we are far past the point when we should be discussing whether
   climate change is a live risk. The Pentagon calls it a “threat
   multiplier” in vulnerable regions of the world. The National
   Intelligence Council says climate change “will almost certainly have
   significant effects, both direct and indirect, across social, economic,
   political, and security realms during the next 20 years.” Firms like
   BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, and Shell, among others, have
   produced serious climate reports focused on the transition needed to
   meet the goals of Paris. And just look at the signals from nature, at
   the dozens of “100-year” events—floods, superstorms, droughts,
   wildfires, record heat waves—taking place in the United States and
   around the world in recent years. Weather-related losses have tripled
   since the 1980s.

   In short, whether to stay in the Paris regime is not a close call.  It
   is not hard.  There is no significant outside constituency arguing for
   America to leave. There is a massive outside constituency—world
   leaders, Fortune 100 CEOS, civil society—urging us to stay, even if the
   price for Trump staying is a downward adjustment of our target. The
   Trump team now appears to be getting it wrong. Where are the determined
   internal voices for getting this right? Where is the vaunted national
   security team to protect our standing, our reputation, our honor? Where
   are the grownups to channel the near-consensus of American business and
   prevent this train-wreck of a decision?

   But we have to confront the likelihood that this happening. So, what do
   we do then?

   What we don’t do is wring our hands or lose hope. All over the United
   States and all over the world we must resolve to defeat the Trump
   administration in its effort to toss climate change overboard.

   Around the world, I believe countries will stay in the Paris climate
   agreement and work to build it into a regime that will enable us to
   meet the climate challenge. They need to elaborate follow-on
   guidelines, rules and procedures in a manner faithful to the essential
   balance of the accord. And, with others, I will encourage them to do
   this in a manner that will pave the way for re-entry by an enlightened
   American administration in the years ahead.

   In the United States, the already strong efforts of our states and
   cities will loom even larger, demonstrating to ourselves and the world
   our commitment to confront climate change. States from California,
   Washington, and Oregon to Minnesota, Illinois, New York, New England,
   and many others are dedicated to strong climate action and will examine
   whether there is still more that they can do. Many more states, both
   red and blue, are charging ahead in developing wind and solar energy.

   The dozen U.S. cities that are part of the global C-40 group on climate
   change account for 25 percent of U.S. population and 30 percent of U.S.
   GDP. In Mexico City last December, led by Mike Bloomberg, they promised
   to deliver action, regardless of what the new Trump administration
   decided to do. These and dozens of other committed U.S. cities have a
   more important role to play than ever.

   It would also be valuable and impactful for engaged U.S. states and
   cities to work with the UNFCCC, the parent body for the Paris regime,
   so that a platform is provided to these pivotal U.S. players to convey
   to the global community a message of engagement, commitment and
   accomplishment back home. The message needs to come through that, while
   the Trump administration may have checked out on climate change,
   America has not.

   Business also has a crucial role to play in driving the clean energy
   transformation. The boom is well under way. Wind and solar accounted
   for two-thirds of all new electric capacity in the United States in
   2016. Costs of wind and solar have dropped over 80 percent in the past
   eight years for solar PV and over 60 percent for wind. And hi-tech
   advances are happening all the time, in battery storage, materials
   science, electric vehicles, and other key elements of the transition.
   It would be a mistake for companies to bet on a go-slow, “Trump” phase.
   The Trump administration’s actions at home and abroad are problematic
   to be sure, but no one can hold back the tides. The transition to clean
   energy is the right side of history, and the smart bet for businesses
   and investors is to keep their eyes on the prize and not get distracted
   by the ideological wars of Washington.

   Finally, civil society, from students to citizens of all ages, already
   active across the country, needs to ramp up even more, to stay engaged
   or get engaged, and make clear to politicians at every level that
   rejecting strong climate action will cost them on election day.

   The Trump administration is about to throw down the gauntlet. If it
   does, we’ll need to take up the challenge.

                      How Do Aliens Solve Climate Change?

   Scientists recently modeled a range of interactions between
   energy-intensive civilizations and their planets. The results were
   sobering.

   The universe does many things. It makes galaxies, comets, black holes,
   neutron stars, and a whole mess more. We’ve lately discovered that it
   makes a great deal of planets, but it’s not clear whether it regularly
   makes energy-hungry civilizations, nor is it clear whether such
   civilizations inevitably drive their planets into climate change.
   There’s lots of hope riding on our talk about building a sustainable
   civilization on Earth. But how do we know that’s even possible? Does
   anyone across the cosmos ever make it?

   Remarkably, science has now advanced to point where we can take a first
   step at answering this question. I know this because my colleagues and
   I have just published a first study mapping out possible histories of
   alien planets, the civilizations they grow, and the climate change that
   follows. Our team was made up of astronomers, an earth scientist, and
   an urban ecologist.

   It was only half-jokingly that we thought of our study as a
   “theoretical archaeology of exo-civilizations.” “Exo-civilizations” are
   what people really mean when they talk about aliens. Astronomers refer
   to the new worlds they’ve discovered as “exoplanets.” They’re now
   gearing up to use the James Webb Space Telescope and other instruments
   to search for life by looking for signs of “exo-biospheres” on those
   exoplanets. So if we have exoplanets and exo-biospheres, it’s time to
   switch out the snicker-inducing word “aliens” for the real focus of our
   concerns: exo-civilizations.

   We’re interested in how exo-civilizations develop on their planets.
   Given that more than 10 billion trillion planets likely exist in the
   cosmos, unless nature is perversely biased against civilizations like
   ours, we’re not the first one to appear. That means each
   exo-civilization that evolved from its planet’s biosphere had a
   history: a story of emergence, rising capacities, and then maybe a slow
   fade or rapid collapse. And just as most species that have ever lived
   on Earth are now extinct, so too most civilizations that emerged (if
   they emerged) may have long since ended. So we’re exploring what may
   have happened to others to gain insights into what might happen to us.

   Of course, we have no direct evidence relating to any exo-civilizations
   or their histories. What we do have, however, are the laws of planets.
   Our robot emissaries have already visited most of the worlds in the
   solar system. We’ve set up weather stations on Mars, watched the
   runaway greenhouse effect on Venus, and seen rain cascade across
   methane lakes on Titan. From these worlds we learned the generic
   physics and chemistry that make up what’s called climate. We can use
   these laws to predict the global response of any planet to something
   like an asteroid impact or perhaps the emergence of an energy-hungry
   industrial civilization.

   To launch our science of exo-civilizations we started with those laws
   of planets, building the right equations to capture the intertwined
   evolution of a planet and its young civilization. But planetary laws of
   physics and chemistry only tell part of the story. If we want to know
   the possible fates of other civilizations on other worlds, we had to
   bring some biology to bear too.

   Science fiction has given us enduring images of alien races. Not
   surprisingly, most of them look a lot like us but with different kinds
   of foreheads or ears, or a different number of fingers on their hands.
   In developing our first cut at a science of exo-civilizations, my
   collaborators and I weren’t interested in what aliens might look like
   or what kind of sex they have. To do our job we had to avoid the
   specifics of both their individual biology and their sociology because
   science provides us little to work with on those fronts. There was,
   however, one place where biology was up to the task.

   Population biology was a radical new field back in the early 20th
   century. Rather than just collecting statistics to describe animal
   populations, a few ambitious researchers like Alfred Lotka wanted to
   create basic mathematical models of things like predators and prey to
   predict the evolution of their linked populations. Predators (like
   wolves) eat prey (like bunnies) so they can make more wolf babies,
   thereby increasing the wolf population. Bunnies do a fine job of
   reproducing on their own, but if too many are eaten, their population
   numbers suffer. Today, population biologists, ecologists, and their
   compatriots use mathematical models to study everything from the spread
   of disease to the propagation of invasive species. The approach has
   even found its way to the study of human civilizations, including their
   collapse in places like Easter Island.

   We used these tools to build a simple model for the evolution of a
   civilization with its planet. In our approach, the exo-civilization’s
   population and the planetary environment are braided together by energy
   use and its consequences. The planet gives the civilization energy
   resources. The civilization consumes them to do the work of
   civilization building. As a civilization harvests more power from the
   planet, its capacities soar. That includes the ability to make and feed
   more babies. This link between available energy (in the form of food
   for simple organisms) and rising birth rates is fundamental to
   population biology. And for human civilization the steep rise we’ve
   seen in population is closely tied to fertilizer involving fossil-fuel
   use. So greater energy will, in the beginning, mean bigger populations.
   But there’s no free lunch from a planetary perspective. Using all that
   energy has to result in feedback on the planet. That’s what we
   earthlings are just starting to see with climate change. If global
   warming gets really nasty, everything from energy harvesting to food
   production is going to get severely stressed and our large human
   population won’t be sustainable. That’s why our exo-civilization models
   linked rising planetary impacts with population declines. It was all
   pretty straightforward, requiring no assumptions about alien economics,
   sociology, or any other science-fiction ideas.

   But to allow for some choice on the part of the exo-civilization we
   also included a basic switch describing how the civilization could
   respond to changing planetary conditions. For the sake of simplicity,
   we imagined that the planet had just two kinds of energy resources. One
   had a high planetary impact (like fossil fuels). The other had low
   impact (like solar energy). In some models we allowed the civilization
   to switch from to one to the other as things got bad.

   So, what did the model tell us? We saw three distinct kinds of
   civilizational histories. The first—and, alarmingly, most common—was
   what we called “the die-off.” As the civilization used energy, its
   numbers grew rapidly, but the use of the resource also pushed the
   planet away from the conditions the civilization grew up with. As the
   evolution of the civilization and planet continued, the population
   skyrocketed, blowing past the planet’s limits. The population, in other
   words, overshot the planet’s carrying capacity. Then came a big
   reduction in the civilization’s population until both the planet and
   the civilization reached a steady state. After that the population and
   the planet stopped changing. A sustainable planetary civilization was
   achieved, but at a high cost. In many of the models, we saw as much as
   70 percent of the population perish before a steady state was reached.
   In reality, it’s not clear that a complex technological civilization
   like ours could survive such a catastrophe.

   In many ways we were seeing a kind of cosmic Easter Island play out.
   There may have been as many as 10,000 people living on Easter Island at
   the peak of its stone-head-making heyday. But by cutting down all the
   trees to roll the stone heads around, that civilization seems to have
   mucked up its ecosystem and sealed its own fate. When the Dutch arrived
   in 1722 only a few thousand folks, living greatly reduced lives, were
   left.

   The second kind of trajectory held the good news. We called it the
   “soft landing.” The population grew and the planet changed but together
   they made a smooth transition to new, balanced equilibrium. The
   civilization had changed the planet but without triggering a massive
   die-off.

   The final class of trajectory was the most worrisome: full-blown
   collapse. As in the die-off histories, the population blew up. But
   these planets just couldn’t handle the avalanche of the civilization’s
   impact. The host worlds were too sensitive to change, like a houseplant
   that withers when it’s moved. Conditions on these planets deteriorated
   so fast the civilization’s population nose-dived all the way to
   extinction.

   You might think switching from the high-impact energy source to the
   low-impact source would make things better. But for some trajectories,
   it didn’t matter. If the civilization used only the high-impact
   resource, the population reached a peak and then quickly dropped to
   zero. But if we allowed the civilization to switch to the low-impact
   energy resource, the collapse still happened in certain cases, even if
   it was delayed. The population would start to fall, then happily
   stabilize. But then, finally and suddenly, it rushed downward to
   extinction.

   The collapses that occurred even when the civilization did the smart
   thing demonstrated an essential point about the modeling process.
   Because the equations capture some of the real world’s complexity, they
   can surprise you. In some of the “delayed collapse” histories, the
   planet’s own internal machinery was the culprit. Push a planet too
   hard, and it won’t return to where it began. We know this can happen,
   even without a civilization present, because we see it on Venus. That
   world should be a kind of sister to our own. But long ago Venus’s
   greenhouse effect slipped into a runaway mode, driving its surface
   temperatures to a hellish 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Our models were
   showing, in generic terms, how a civilization could push a planet down
   the hill into a different kind of runaway through its own activity.

   The model we created was, however, just a first stab at a science of
   exo-civilizations. We made the equations a simple as possible while
   still capturing the essence of planet-civilization “coevolution.” That
   means it’s too early to answer the question, “Does anyone make it?”
   Still, our work provides the basic contours of what might happen.

   We need to put in more detailed and realistic climate physics. We also
   need to include the full range of energy sources a young civilization
   might find on its home world—the list is limited by physics:
   combustion, solar, wind, geothermal, tides, nuclear, and a few others.
   Even though our initial models were simple, they still revealed a
   radical truth about the challenge we face as we push the Earth into its
   human-dominated era. Unless the universe is deeply biased against it,
   there have been other civilizations across space and time that faced
   these challenges. Anthropocenes may be common.

   As I explore in my new book, Light of the Stars: Alien Worlds and the
   Fate of the Earth, our dawning realization that we are profoundly
   shaping Earth’s future provides us with the impetus to stop acting like
   cosmic teenagers with power but little wisdom. From that perspective
   the true narrative of climate change isn’t some small, local drama of
   Democrats vs. Republications or business interests vs.
   environmentalists. Instead, it’s a cosmic test, one that gives us a
   chance to join those who successfully crossed this burning frontier—or
   the chance to be consigned to the scrap heap of civilizations too
   shortsighted to take care of their own planet.

                  Why It Was Easier to Be Skinny in the 1980s

   A new study finds that people today who eat and exercise the same
   amount as people 20 years ago are still fatter.


    Olga Khazan

   Sep 30, 2015

   Reed Saxon / AP

   There’s a meme aimed at Millennial catharsis called “Old Economy
   Steve.” It’s a series of pictures of a late-70s teenager, who
   presumably is now a middle-aged man, that mocks some of the messages
   Millennials say they hear from older generations—and shows why they’re
   deeply janky. Old Economy Steve graduates and gets a job right away.
   Old Economy Steve “worked his way through college” because tuition was
   $400. And so forth.
   Quickmeme

   We can now add another one to that list: Old Economy Steve ate at
   McDonald’s almost every day, and he still somehow had a 32-inch waist.
   MemeGenerator.net

   A study published recently in the journal Obesity Research & Clinical
   Practice found that it’s harder for adults today to maintain the same
   weight as those 20 to 30 years ago did, even at the same levels of food
   intake and exercise.

   The authors examined the dietary data of 36,400 Americans between 1971
   and 2008 and the physical activity data of 14,419 people between 1988
   and 2006. They grouped the data sets together by the amount of food and
   activity, age, and BMI.

   They found a very surprising correlation: A given person, in 2006,
   eating the same amount of calories, taking in the same quantities of
   macronutrients like protein and fat, and exercising the same amount as
   a person of the same age did in 1988 would have a BMI that was about
   2.3 points higher. In other words, people today are about 10 percent
   heavier than people were in the 1980s, even if they follow the exact
   same diet and exercise plans.

   “Our study results suggest that if you are 25, you’d have to eat even
   less and exercise more than those older, to prevent gaining weight,”
   Jennifer Kuk, a professor of kinesiology and health science at
   Toronto’s York University, said in a statement. “However, it also
   indicates there may be other specific changes contributing to the rise
   in obesity beyond just diet and exercise.”

   Just what those other changes might be, though, are still a matter of
   hypothesis. In an interview, Kuk proffered three different factors that
   might be making harder for adults today to stay thin.

   First, people are exposed to more chemicals that might be weight-gain
   inducing. Pesticides, flame retardants, and the substances in food
   packaging might all be altering our hormonal processes and tweaking the
   way our bodies put on and maintain weight.

   Second, the use of prescription drugs has risen dramatically since the
   ‘70s and ‘80s. Prozac, the first blockbuster SSRI, came out in 1988.
   Antidepressants are now one of the most commonly prescribed drugs in
   the U.S., and many of them have been linked to weight gain.

     __________________________________________________________________

   Finally, Kuk and the other study authors think that the microbiomes of
   Americans might have somehow changed between the 1980s and now. It’s
   well known that some types of gut bacteria make a person more prone to
   weight gain and obesity. Americans are eating more meat than they were
   a few decades ago, and many animal products are treated with hormones
   and antibiotics in order to promote growth. All that meat might be
   changing gut bacteria in ways that are subtle, at first, but add up
   over time. Kuk believes the proliferation of artificial sweeteners
   could also be playing a role.

   The fact that the body weights of Americans today are influenced by
   factors beyond their control is a sign, Kuk says, that society should
   be kinder to people of all body types.

   “There's a huge weight bias against people with obesity,” she said.
   “They're judged as lazy and self-indulgent. That's really not the case.
   If our research is correct, you need to eat even less and exercise even
   more” just to be same weight as your parents were at your age.

   The exercise part is perhaps one area where Old Economy Steve doesn’t
   have an edge. A membership at one of the newfangled fitness centers of
   1987 would go for about $2,800 per year in today’s dollars, and that’s
   still what it costs today.

                          Always Have Three Beverages

   The correct number of drinks to keep at your desk

   The phrase rule of three is a Rorschach test. When people hear it, it
   can conjure an array of disparate guidelines. Celebrity deaths.
   Rhetorical technique. Aesthetic pleasure. Free markets. Joke writing.
   There are so many rules of three across disciplines and superstitions
   that the concept requires its own disambiguation page on Wikipedia,
   which lists 17 different options.

   Some of those rules are more important than others. Pilots have one for
   landing airplanes that advises descending 1,000 feet every three miles
   to ensure that the plane doesn’t drop too quickly for passengers to
   adjust to changing cabin pressure. Outdoors-people use one as a guide
   for how long people can usually stay alive in extreme conditions: three
   minutes without oxygen, three hours without shelter, three days without
   water, and three weeks without food. More broadly, groupings of three
   pop up everywhere: the Holy Trinity, the three branches of the U.S.
   government, the number of data points required to determine an unknown
   location, the number of partners needed to corner people at a party to
   talk about polyamory.

   Relatively little is known about why people enjoy and invoke triads so
   frequently. But after more than a decade of personal research, I’d like
   to present a new rule of three for your consideration: If you work at a
   desk in an office, three desk beverages is the ideal number to keep by
   your side. The first is water. The second is a source of caffeine. The
   third is something fun—a juice, a soda, a glass of wine on Friday
   afternoon (if your office is like that), a kombucha (if you are like
   that).

   The case for having any beverages at your desk in the first place is
   one of basic human biology. Your mom was right when she told you to
   drink some water: Mild dehydration isn’t a notable health risk, but the
   spotty research done on the topic suggests that being thirsty is
   distracting. Slaking that thirst might help you return to your
   spreadsheets and get out of the office on time. Even if you’re not
   thirsty, people tend to report feeling more alert after having some
   water. Water is the foundation of your beverage kingdom.

   And then there’s caffeine. Research has shown that it improves
   alertness in moderately sleepy people—for instance, those who
   underestimated the size of their sandwich and are now slowly slipping
   into a food coma at their desk. Maybe you stayed a little too long at
   happy hour last night and need a coffee to help ease your headache. Or
   maybe you’ve just been riding around on the planet with the rest of us
   for long enough that you need a Diet Coke on a spiritual level. Add it
   to the lineup.

   Completing the desk-bev triumvirate is where the magic happens. A third
   beverage is your wild card, a chance for a little bit of random
   pleasure in a period of the day that is otherwise not your own. One of
   the reasons people go so wild for random snacks in the workplace is
   that popcorn or cookies allow a moment of disengagement from work that
   feels autonomous. Since water and coffee are the only drinks many
   workplaces provide, tracking down a third can be an excuse to leave the
   office for a moment, even if it’s just to run to the nearby corner
   store. Small, regular pleasures have real psychological value in any
   part of life. During the workday, acquiring a mango seltzer or green
   juice can return some humanity to the cubicle farm.

   It probably isn’t a coincidence that three is my personal sweet spot,
   according to Kurt Carlson, a marketing researcher at the College of
   William & Mary’s Raymond A. Mason School of Business. As far as I can
   tell, he’s the only person who has done significant research into why
   and how human brains sort things into groupings of three. “People
   believe they’re observing something special when they see the third
   instance of it happen,” he explains. “After making three shots in a
   row, the person’s hot, and four doesn’t make them more hot. If you miss
   three traffic lights in a row, the world’s out to get you.”

   Carlson references shots because he began his research by looking at
   data from the Philadelphia 76ers basketball team. He found that when
   players make or miss three shots in a row, both they and their
   competitors believe that they are on a streak, which actually changes
   the probability of a player making or missing the next shot. If a guy
   is hot, he is “going to take shots that he shouldn’t take, the defense
   is going to double-team him, his teammates are going to force him the
   ball in places they shouldn’t have forced him the ball,” Carlson
   explains. Counterintuitively, that makes a player with “hot hands” less
   likely to make a fourth shot than under baseline circumstances. The
   inverse also happens for players who miss three: Everyone takes that as
   a sign that a player is no longer a threat, and the player’s chances of
   sinking a shot end up improving.

   When it comes time to make decisions or process new information, people
   often default to problem-solving shortcuts called heuristics, many of
   which are so ingrained in human thinking that it might feel like you
   were born with them. Carlson believes that groupings of three spring
   out of our brains’ efforts to be simultaneously organized and complete.
   “The least cognitively challenging way to categorize things is to put
   them into two buckets, and the hardest way is to treat everything as an
   individual,” he says. The middle-ground approach to distinguishing
   between concepts without driving ourselves mad with nuance is to put
   things into three categories. In that sense, at least, the theory of
   hydration, caffeine, and pleasure is time-tested and psychologically
   approved.

   Unfortunately, academia stands in the way of testing my desk-bev theory
   any further. “That is as far as I got,” Carlson says. “I moved on. You
   can only publish so many things that are cutesy like that before you
   damage your reputation as a real scholar.”
