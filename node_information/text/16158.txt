       Application-Driven Quantum and Statistical Physics Application-Driven
   Quantum and Statistical Physics
   A Short Course for Future Scientists and Engineers
   Volume 1: Foundations
   by Jean-Michel Gillet

   "Several features make this book unusual. The first is the historical
   content ... Second, the practical importance of quantum physics is
   demonstrated by the inclusion of numerous summary discussions of
   technological applications ... A third unusual feature of this book is
   a detailed solution immediately following each in-text exercise. Each
   such problem is used to advance the discussion, and the
   question-and-answer format encourages the student to wrestle with the
   ideas personally rather than simply reading passively ... This short
   book would easily make a helpful secondary text allowing an instructor
   to touch on some non-traditional topics such as least action principles
   and path integrals."

       Metals and Energy Finance Metals and Energy Finance
   Application of Quantitative Finance Techniques to the Evaluation of
   Minerals, Coal and Petroleum Projects
   2nd Edition
   by Dennis L Buchanan & Mark H A Davis

   "Dennis Buchanan's text clearly shows how an understanding of the
   complementary disciplines of geoscience, conventional engineering and
   advanced financial engineering is essential to making the right
   decisions concerning how to appraise a resource or project and how to
   structure the funding of natural resources assets in order to mitigate
   technical and financial risk and to maximise value for owners.
   Crucially, the book also looks at how other sources of capital, such as
   limited recourse lenders, appraise metals and energy assets. Such an
   understanding is essential to optimising the capital structure and
   valuation of natural resources assets ¡ The advanced methodologies
   revealed in Dennis Buchanan's book will have great value to those
   working in the technical and financial functions, or to those spanning
   both functions, of the natural resources industry."
