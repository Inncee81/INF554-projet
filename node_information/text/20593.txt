   characteristics of the entitity, e.g. a product feature or another
   characteristic for which there is no matching property in schema.org.
   Note: Publishers should be aware that applications designed to use
   specific schema.org properties (e.g. http://schema.org/width,
   http://schema.org/color, http://schema.org/gtin13, ...) will typically
   expect such data to be provided using those properties, rather than
   using the generic property/value mechanism.
   aggregateRating
   AggregateRating  The overall rating, based on a collection of reviews
   or ratings, of the item.
   audience
   Audience  An intended audience, i.e. a group for whom something was
   created. Supersedes serviceAudience.

   gtin
   Text  A Global Trade Item Number (GTIN). GTINs identify trade items,
   including products and services, using numeric identification codes.
   The gtin property generalizes the earlier gtin8, gtin12, gtin13, and
   gtin14 properties. The GS1 digital link specifications express GTINs as
   URLs. A correct gtin value should be a valid GTIN, which means that it
   should be an all-numeric string of either 8, 12, 13 or 14 digits, or a
   "GS1 Digital Link" URL based on such a string. The numeric component
   should also have a valid GS1 check digit and meet the other rules for
   valid GTINs. See also GS1's GTIN Summary and Wikipedia for more
   details. Left-padding of the gtin values is not required or encouraged.
   gtin12
   Text  The GTIN-12 code of the product, or the product to which the
   offer refers. The GTIN-12 is the 12-digit GS1 Identification Key
   composed of a U.P.C. Company Prefix, Item Reference, and Check Digit
   used to identify trade items. See GS1 GTIN Summary for more details.
   gtin13
   Text  The GTIN-13 code of the product, or the product to which the
   offer refers. This is equivalent to 13-digit ISBN codes and EAN UCC-13.
   Former 12-digit UPC codes can be converted into a GTIN-13 code by
   simply adding a preceeding zero. See GS1 GTIN Summary for more details.
   gtin14
   Text  The GTIN-14 code of the product, or the product to which the
   offer refers. See GS1 GTIN Summary for more details.
   gtin8

   Text  The model of the product. Use with the URL of a ProductModel or a

   additionally provide strong product identifiers via the
   gtin8/gtin13/gtin14 and mpn properties.
   mpn
   Text  The Manufacturer Part Number (MPN) of the product, or the product
   to which the offer refers.
   nsn
   Text  Indicates the NATO stock number (nsn) of a Product.

   a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. In
   RDFa syntax, it is better to use the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof'
   attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org tools may have only weaker
   understanding of extra types, in particular those defined externally.
   alternateName
   Text  An alias for the item.
   description
   Text  A description of the item.
   disambiguatingDescription
   Text  A sub property of description. A short description of the item

   of the party primarily responsible for the creation of the

   sometimes related information (e.g. indicating a funder) can be
   expressed using schema.org terminology.

   spatial
   Place  The "spatial" property can be used in cases when more specific
   properties (e.g. locationCreated, spatialCoverage, contentLocation) are
   not known to be appropriate.
   spatialCoverage
   Place  The spatialCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the place(s)
   which are the focus of the content. It is a subproperty of
   contentLocation intended primarily for more technical and detailed
   materials. For example with a Dataset, it indicates areas that the
   dataset describes: a dataset of New York weather would have
   spatialCoverage which was the place: the state of New York.

   temporalCoverage
   DateTime  or
   Text  or
   URL  The temporalCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the period that
   the content applies to, i.e. that it describes, either as a DateTime or
   as a textual string indicating a time period in ISO 8601 time interval
   format. In the case of a Dataset it will typically indicate the
   relevant time period in a precise notation (e.g. for a 2011 census
   dataset, the year 2011 would be written "2011/2012"). Other forms of
   content e.g. ScholarlyArticle, Book, TVSeries or TVEpisode may indicate
   their temporalCoverage in broader terms - textually or via well-known
   URL. Written works such as books may sometimes have precise temporal
   coverage too, e.g. a work set in 1939 - 1945 can be indicated in ISO
   8601 interval format format via "1939/1945".
   Open-ended date ranges can be written with ".." in place of the end
   date. For example, "2015-11/.." indicates a range beginning in November
   2015 and with no specified final date. This is tentative and might be
   updated in future when ISO 8601 is officially updated. Supersedes
   datasetTimeInterval.

   Properties from Thing
   additionalType
   URL  An additional type for the item, typically used for adding more
   specific types from external vocabularies in microdata syntax. This is
   a relationship between something and a class that the thing is in. In
   RDFa syntax, it is better to use the native RDFa syntax - the 'typeof'
   attribute - for multiple types. Schema.org tools may have only weaker
   understanding of extra types, in particular those defined externally.

   Text  or
   URL  The identifier property represents any kind of identifier for any
   kind of Thing, such as ISBNs, GTIN codes, UUIDs etc. Schema.org
