Thanks to our Fans, Xbox One X is Fastest-Selling Xbox Pre-Order Ever

   by Will Tuttle Posted on August 25, 2017September 20, 2017 at 6:00 am
   Xbox One X Project Scorpio Edition console and controller

   Sunday night in Germany we unveiled the Xbox One X Project Scorpio
   Edition, a special edition console designed for our biggest fans. That
   night we launched pre-orders worldwide and we have been overwhelmed by
   your response.

   Within just a few days, we saw record-setting sell-out times and are
   currently sold out in many countries around the world.

   You, our biggest fans, have pre-ordered more Xbox One X Project Scorpio
   Edition consoles in the first five days than any Xbox ever.

     “Microsoft has done it again! The innovation and power behind the
     new Xbox One X console is driving excitement and demand among our
     customers worldwide,” said Bob Puzon, senior vice president of
     Merchandising for GameStop. “The speed at which we sold through our
     initial pre-order supply surpassed expectations, and what we
     experienced with pre-orders for the original Xbox One console. This
     new system is definitely going to change how video games are
     played!” – GameStop

     “A great piece of tech with a great onrush. Microsoft’s high-end
     console hits the hearts and minds of our console fans. We were
     absolutely astonished with the run on Microsoft`s new flagship
     console of the Xbox One family. The Xbox One X Project Scorpio
     Edition was the fastest sold-out Xbox console ever.” – Media Markt

   Although our fans may no longer be able to pre-order the Xbox One X
   Project Scorpio Edition in their country, we know people are still
   anxious to get their hands on the world’s most powerful console. We
   will be announcing details of the next wave of Xbox One X standard
   edition pre-orders next month so stay tuned for more information.

   We can’t wait for November 7. Excitement is building – from developers
   who have committed that more than 100 new and existing games will be
   enhanced for Xbox One X, to the 300,000+ European fans who got the
   chance to experience the full power of Xbox One X this week, to
   receiving the gamescom 2017 award for best hardware.

   There’s really never been a better time to be an Xbox gamer. YOU made
   Xbox One X the fastest-selling pre-order in Xbox history. From all of
   us at Team Xbox, thank you!

See the World in Microsoft Flight Simulator

   by Mike Nelson, Xbox Wire Editor Posted on September 30, 2019September
   30, 2019

   It took a couple of flybys, and dusting off the memories of the street
   layout from my hometown of Kailua, Hawai’i, but I can successfully
   report that I found my childhood home while buzzing palm trees in a
   Cessna 172 during a recent hands-on preview with Microsoft Flight
   Simulator. Whenever I’ve played a new version of MSFS, looking for my
   house has almost always been my first activity (next to taking off, of
   course). Over 30+ years of “flying,” I’ve seen my hometown morph from
   polygon squares to ground mesh to pixelated landscapes. But never have
   I been so convinced that what I just flew over wasn’t my actual house.
   Or the beach down the street that I’d take my dog to. Or... Read more:

   and extraordinary fortune which she has seen throughout her life, with

   The beauty of video games is that you can do whatever you want, so for
   our game we went for two things that are hard or not recommended to do
   in real life: being a God and being a bit evil. Sea Salt takes place in
   a setting inspired by HP Lovecraft and European folklore, where you
   play as an Old God betrayed by the Bishop of your own religion. After
   you granted your followers food, fortune, and fair winds for their
   fishing boats, The Bishop, who lead your human followers on land,
   turned out to be an unworthy coward when it was time to pay the final
   price...so now, when the deal between man and the Old God of the sea is

   Who likes a road trip? Visiting places new, visiting places familiar,
   spending time with family, keeping an eye on petrol and maybe even
   getting your hands dirty to repair the car – this is exactly what
   Jalopy’s all about. You’ll set out on a grand journey through the
   former Eastern Bloc with your uncle, driving a scrappy old car and
   navigating miles of tire changing, fuel burning, and carburettor
   busting through night and day, rain and shine. As you spend time
   playing Jalopy, you’ll become more and more accustomed to your Laika
   601 Deluxe – but let’s give you a little insight now, so that you’re

   Driven Out Consoles

In Driven Out the Protagonist is Not the Main Attraction

   by Jens Kolhammar, Developer, No Pest Productions Posted on October 1,
   2019October 1, 2019

   Enemies in games have always fascinated me. Their design, their
   animations, their moveset and the underlying AI that rules them are all
   important facets that creates something that almost feels alive. The
   main protagonist is often the focus of any game, but I find that it is
   more often the enemies that will have the biggest impact on me. Driven
   Out is designed around the idea that the enemies should be the real
   stars of the show. This was done in several ways. The most obvious one
   is enemy variation. Most enemies show up in the game only around two
   times to try to keep every single encounter impactful. However, the
   most important way I focused on enemies was that I tried to design
   to... Read more: In Driven Out the Protagonist is Not the Main

   by Thomas Foss – Lead Game Designer, Neverwinter Posted on October 1,
   2019October 1, 2019

   A never-ending war between the fierce Githyanki and their former
   overlords - the powerful Illithid - has overflowed into the iconic
   dungeon of Undermountain. Both groups are searching for a powerful and
   ancient artifact that allows entry into a fortress city contained in
   the chaotic plane of Limbo. Either faction gaining access to this
   bastion of the Githzerai order would be disastrous. While the Githyanki
   and Githzerai share common ancestry, philosophical differences have
   driven the two into civil war, but some have seen the larger picture
   and set their differences aside. A small band of unified Gith, composed
   of both Githyanki and Githzerai, seek to recover the artifact and

   have greater firepower and a diverse range of tactical possibilities at
   your disposal. And having backup can make those overwhelming odds feel

   30, 2019

   It took a couple of flybys, and dusting off the memories of the street
   layout from my hometown of Kailua, Hawai’i, but I can successfully
   report that I found my childhood home while buzzing palm trees in a
   Cessna 172 during a recent hands-on preview with Microsoft Flight
   Simulator. Whenever I’ve played a new version of MSFS, looking for my
   house has almost always been my first activity (next to taking off, of
   course). Over 30+ years of “flying,” I’ve seen my hometown morph from
   polygon squares to ground mesh to pixelated landscapes. But never have
   I been so convinced that what I just flew over wasn’t my actual house.
   Or the beach down the street that I’d take my dog to. Or... Read more:

Sally’s Law Brings You a Tear Jerking Story of a Daughter and a Father to
Xbox One

   by Sammy Sumida, CRO, Sally's Law Posted on October 3, 2019October 3,
   2019

   The story begins when Sally learns that her father has become ill and
   heads to her home, where she has left a very long time ago. Sally's Law
   explores the relationship between Sally and her critically ill father.
   As the game unfolds, the relationship between daughter and father will
   be unveiled. Along the way to her home, Sally experiences great luck
   and extraordinary fortune which she has seen throughout her life, with
   the help of a secret supporter: her father. The game play controls are
   simple - Roll left and right, and jump. But there are many challenging
   stages which players must make Sally and the father cooperate to solve
   the puzzles. After playing the game as Sally,... Read more: Sally’s Law

Become an Eldritch God and Punish Heretics That Defy You in Sea Salt

   by Josef Martinovsky, Game Designer, Sea Salt Posted on October 3,
   2019October 3, 2019

   The beauty of video games is that you can do whatever you want, so for
   our game we went for two things that are hard or not recommended to do
   in real life: being a God and being a bit evil. Sea Salt takes place in
   a setting inspired by HP Lovecraft and European folklore, where you
   play as an Old God betrayed by the Bishop of your own religion. After
   you granted your followers food, fortune, and fair winds for their
   fishing boats, The Bishop, who lead your human followers on land,
   turned out to be an unworthy coward when it was time to pay the final
   price...so now, when the deal between man and the Old God of the sea is
   broken, they will find is your vengeance! Our approach to Sea... Read

Building Your Scrappy Motoring Masterpiece in Jalopy

   Who likes a road trip? Visiting places new, visiting places familiar,
   spending time with family, keeping an eye on petrol and maybe even
   getting your hands dirty to repair the car – this is exactly what
   Jalopy’s all about. You’ll set out on a grand journey through the
   former Eastern Bloc with your uncle, driving a scrappy old car and
   navigating miles of tire changing, fuel burning, and carburettor
   busting through night and day, rain and shine. As you spend time
   playing Jalopy, you’ll become more and more accustomed to your Laika
   601 Deluxe – but let’s give you a little insight now, so that you’re
   ready to jump behind the wheel and ignite the engine come October 31!

   Driven Out Consoles

In Driven Out the Protagonist is Not the Main Attraction

   by Jens Kolhammar, Developer, No Pest Productions Posted on October 1,
   2019October 1, 2019

   Enemies in games have always fascinated me. Their design, their
   animations, their moveset and the underlying AI that rules them are all
   important facets that creates something that almost feels alive. The
   main protagonist is often the focus of any game, but I find that it is
   more often the enemies that will have the biggest impact on me. Driven
   Out is designed around the idea that the enemies should be the real
   stars of the show. This was done in several ways. The most obvious one
   is enemy variation. Most enemies show up in the game only around two
   times to try to keep every single encounter impactful. However, the
   most important way I focused on enemies was that I tried to design
   to... Read more: In Driven Out the Protagonist is Not the Main

   by Thomas Foss – Lead Game Designer, Neverwinter Posted on October 1,
   2019October 1, 2019

   A never-ending war between the fierce Githyanki and their former
   overlords - the powerful Illithid - has overflowed into the iconic
   dungeon of Undermountain. Both groups are searching for a powerful and
   ancient artifact that allows entry into a fortress city contained in
   the chaotic plane of Limbo. Either faction gaining access to this
   bastion of the Githzerai order would be disastrous. While the Githyanki
   and Githzerai share common ancestry, philosophical differences have
   driven the two into civil war, but some have seen the larger picture
   and set their differences aside. A small band of unified Gith, composed
   of both Githyanki and Githzerai, seek to recover the artifact and

Ghost Recon Breakpoint Launches in Early Access on Xbox One

   Ghost Recon Breakpoint players with Gold or Ultimate editions can now

   Ghost Recon Breakpoint standard edition will launch October 4. Whether
   playing solo or co-op, either choice can give the game a different
   feel; in solo, there’s a sense of being hunted as you use every trick

   have greater firepower and a diverse range of tactical possibilities at
   your disposal. And having backup can make those overwhelming odds feel

   Driven Out Consoles

In Driven Out the Protagonist is Not the Main Attraction

   by Jens Kolhammar, Developer, No Pest Productions Posted on October 1,
   2019October 1, 2019

   Enemies in games have always fascinated me. Their design, their
   animations, their moveset and the underlying AI that rules them are all
   important facets that creates something that almost feels alive. The
   main protagonist is often the focus of any game, but I find that it is
   more often the enemies that will have the biggest impact on me. Driven
   Out is designed around the idea that the enemies should be the real
   stars of the show. This was done in several ways. The most obvious one
   is enemy variation. Most enemies show up in the game only around two
   times to try to keep every single encounter impactful. However, the
   most important way I focused on enemies was that I tried to design

Neverwinter: Uprising is an Exciting Story from the D&D Universe Featuring a
Rebellion and Dragons in Space

   by Thomas Foss – Lead Game Designer, Neverwinter Posted on October 1,
   2019October 1, 2019

   A never-ending war between the fierce Githyanki and their former
   overlords - the powerful Illithid - has overflowed into the iconic
   dungeon of Undermountain. Both groups are searching for a powerful and
   ancient artifact that allows entry into a fortress city contained in
   the chaotic plane of Limbo. Either faction gaining access to this
   bastion of the Githzerai order would be disastrous. While the Githyanki
   and Githzerai share common ancestry, philosophical differences have
   driven the two into civil war, but some have seen the larger picture
   and set their differences aside. A small band of unified Gith, composed
   of both Githyanki and Githzerai, seek to recover the artifact and

Ghost Recon Breakpoint Launches in Early Access on Xbox One

   Ghost Recon Breakpoint players with Gold or Ultimate editions can now

   enemy lines, or as a co-op team of up to four Ghosts via Xbox Live.
   Ghost Recon Breakpoint standard edition will launch October 4. Whether
   playing solo or co-op, either choice can give the game a different
   feel; in solo, there’s a sense of being hunted as you use every trick

   have greater firepower and a diverse range of tactical possibilities at
   your disposal. And having backup can make those overwhelming odds feel

Thanks to our Fans, Xbox One X is Fastest-Selling Xbox Pre-Order Ever

   by Will Tuttle Posted on August 25, 2017September 20, 2017 at 6:00 am
   Xbox One X Project Scorpio Edition console and controller

   Sunday night in Germany we unveiled the Xbox One X Project Scorpio
   Edition, a special edition console designed for our biggest fans. That
   night we launched pre-orders worldwide and we have been overwhelmed by
   your response.

   Within just a few days, we saw record-setting sell-out times and are
   currently sold out in many countries around the world.

   You, our biggest fans, have pre-ordered more Xbox One X Project Scorpio
   Edition consoles in the first five days than any Xbox ever.

     “Microsoft has done it again! The innovation and power behind the
     new Xbox One X console is driving excitement and demand among our
     customers worldwide,” said Bob Puzon, senior vice president of
     Merchandising for GameStop. “The speed at which we sold through our
     initial pre-order supply surpassed expectations, and what we
     experienced with pre-orders for the original Xbox One console. This
     new system is definitely going to change how video games are
     played!” – GameStop

     “A great piece of tech with a great onrush. Microsoft’s high-end
     console hits the hearts and minds of our console fans. We were
     absolutely astonished with the run on Microsoft`s new flagship
     console of the Xbox One family. The Xbox One X Project Scorpio
     Edition was the fastest sold-out Xbox console ever.” – Media Markt

   Although our fans may no longer be able to pre-order the Xbox One X
   Project Scorpio Edition in their country, we know people are still
   anxious to get their hands on the world’s most powerful console. We
   will be announcing details of the next wave of Xbox One X standard
   edition pre-orders next month so stay tuned for more information.

   We can’t wait for November 7. Excitement is building – from developers
   who have committed that more than 100 new and existing games will be
   enhanced for Xbox One X, to the 300,000+ European fans who got the
   chance to experience the full power of Xbox One X this week, to
   receiving the gamescom 2017 award for best hardware.

   There’s really never been a better time to be an Xbox gamer. YOU made
   Xbox One X the fastest-selling pre-order in Xbox history. From all of
   us at Team Xbox, thank you!

   It took a couple of flybys, and dusting off the memories of the street
   layout from my hometown of Kailua, Hawai’i, but I can successfully
   report that I found my childhood home while buzzing palm trees in a
   Cessna 172 during a recent hands-on preview with Microsoft Flight
   Simulator. Whenever I’ve played a new version of MSFS, looking for my
   house has almost always been my first activity (next to taking off, of
   course). Over 30+ years of “flying,” I’ve seen my hometown morph from
   polygon squares to ground mesh to pixelated landscapes. But never have
   I been so convinced that what I just flew over wasn’t my actual house.
   Or the beach down the street that I’d take my dog to. Or... Read more:

   you granted your followers food, fortune, and fair winds for their

   Who likes a road trip? Visiting places new, visiting places familiar,

   getting your hands dirty to repair the car – this is exactly what
   Jalopy’s all about. You’ll set out on a grand journey through the
   former Eastern Bloc with your uncle, driving a scrappy old car and
   navigating miles of tire changing, fuel burning, and carburettor
   busting through night and day, rain and shine. As you spend time
   playing Jalopy, you’ll become more and more accustomed to your Laika
   601 Deluxe – but let’s give you a little insight now, so that you’re

Neverwinter: Uprising is an Exciting Story from the D&D Universe Featuring a
Rebellion and Dragons in Space

   by Thomas Foss – Lead Game Designer, Neverwinter Posted on October 1,
   2019October 1, 2019

   A never-ending war between the fierce Githyanki and their former
   overlords - the powerful Illithid - has overflowed into the iconic
   dungeon of Undermountain. Both groups are searching for a powerful and
   ancient artifact that allows entry into a fortress city contained in
   the chaotic plane of Limbo. Either faction gaining access to this
   bastion of the Githzerai order would be disastrous. While the Githyanki
   and Githzerai share common ancestry, philosophical differences have
   driven the two into civil war, but some have seen the larger picture
   and set their differences aside. A small band of unified Gith, composed
   of both Githyanki and Githzerai, seek to recover the artifact and

Ghost Recon Breakpoint Launches in Early Access on Xbox One

   Ghost Recon Breakpoint players with Gold or Ultimate editions can now
   explore the vast archipelago of Auroa as a lone Ghost trapped behind
   enemy lines, or as a co-op team of up to four Ghosts via Xbox Live.
   Ghost Recon Breakpoint standard edition will launch October 4. Whether
   playing solo or co-op, either choice can give the game a different
   feel; in solo, there’s a sense of being hunted as you use every trick
   at your disposal to survive against overwhelming odds. In co-op, you’ll
   have greater firepower and a diverse range of tactical possibilities at
   your disposal. And having backup can make those overwhelming odds feel
   a little more even as you and your team match wits with... Read more:

   Dauntless is officially leaving early access with the launch of its

   fearsome new Behemoth called Tempestborne Stormclaw, but the Slayers of
   Ramsgate aren’t sitting idly by. The Scarred Master has arrived,

   is Dan “dibs” Gibson, Designer at Phoenix Labs, and I’m here today to
   give you the rundown on Dauntless’ newest weapon. Meet the Scarred
   Master. The Scarred Master witnessed the raw fury of Tempestborne
   Stormclaw first-hand when it robbed her and her people of their home.

   30, 2019

   It took a couple of flybys, and dusting off the memories of the street
   layout from my hometown of Kailua, Hawai’i, but I can successfully
   report that I found my childhood home while buzzing palm trees in a
   Cessna 172 during a recent hands-on preview with Microsoft Flight
   Simulator. Whenever I’ve played a new version of MSFS, looking for my
   house has almost always been my first activity (next to taking off, of
   course). Over 30+ years of “flying,” I’ve seen my hometown morph from
   polygon squares to ground mesh to pixelated landscapes. But never have
   I been so convinced that what I just flew over wasn’t my actual house.
   Or the beach down the street that I’d take my dog to. Or... Read more:

   and extraordinary fortune which she has seen throughout her life, with
   the help of a secret supporter: her father. The game play controls are

   Jalopy’s all about. You’ll set out on a grand journey through the
   former Eastern Bloc with your uncle, driving a scrappy old car and
   navigating miles of tire changing, fuel burning, and carburettor
   busting through night and day, rain and shine. As you spend time

In Driven Out the Protagonist is Not the Main Attraction

   by Jens Kolhammar, Developer, No Pest Productions Posted on October 1,
   2019October 1, 2019

   Enemies in games have always fascinated me. Their design, their
   animations, their moveset and the underlying AI that rules them are all
   important facets that creates something that almost feels alive. The
   main protagonist is often the focus of any game, but I find that it is
   more often the enemies that will have the biggest impact on me. Driven
   Out is designed around the idea that the enemies should be the real
   stars of the show. This was done in several ways. The most obvious one
   is enemy variation. Most enemies show up in the game only around two
   times to try to keep every single encounter impactful. However, the
   most important way I focused on enemies was that I tried to design

Ghost Recon Breakpoint Launches in Early Access on Xbox One

   by Mikel Reparaz, Editor, Ubisoft Posted on September 30, 2019September
   30, 2019

   Ghost Recon Breakpoint players with Gold or Ultimate editions can now
   explore the vast archipelago of Auroa as a lone Ghost trapped behind
   enemy lines, or as a co-op team of up to four Ghosts via Xbox Live.
   Ghost Recon Breakpoint standard edition will launch October 4. Whether
   playing solo or co-op, either choice can give the game a different
   feel; in solo, there’s a sense of being hunted as you use every trick
   at your disposal to survive against overwhelming odds. In co-op, you’ll
   have greater firepower and a diverse range of tactical possibilities at
   your disposal. And having backup can make those overwhelming odds feel
   a little more even as you and your team match wits with... Read more:

   2019September 27, 2019

   Dauntless is officially leaving early access with the launch of its
   latest season: Aether Unbound. This season comes complete with a
   fearsome new Behemoth called Tempestborne Stormclaw, but the Slayers of
   Ramsgate aren’t sitting idly by. The Scarred Master has arrived,
   bringing with her a powerful new weapon: the aether strikers. My name
   is Dan “dibs” Gibson, Designer at Phoenix Labs, and I’m here today to
   give you the rundown on Dauntless’ newest weapon. Meet the Scarred
   Master. The Scarred Master witnessed the raw fury of Tempestborne
   Stormclaw first-hand when it robbed her and her people of their home.

See the World in Microsoft Flight Simulator

   by Mike Nelson, Xbox Wire Editor Posted on September 30, 2019September
   30, 2019

   It took a couple of flybys, and dusting off the memories of the street
   layout from my hometown of Kailua, Hawai’i, but I can successfully
   report that I found my childhood home while buzzing palm trees in a
   Cessna 172 during a recent hands-on preview with Microsoft Flight
   Simulator. Whenever I’ve played a new version of MSFS, looking for my
   house has almost always been my first activity (next to taking off, of
   course). Over 30+ years of “flying,” I’ve seen my hometown morph from
   polygon squares to ground mesh to pixelated landscapes. But never have
   I been so convinced that what I just flew over wasn’t my actual house.
   Or the beach down the street that I’d take my dog to. Or... Read more:

   The story begins when Sally learns that her father has become ill and

   be unveiled. Along the way to her home, Sally experiences great luck
   and extraordinary fortune which she has seen throughout her life, with
   the help of a secret supporter: her father. The game play controls are
   simple - Roll left and right, and jump. But there are many challenging
   stages which players must make Sally and the father cooperate to solve

   The beauty of video games is that you can do whatever you want, so for
   our game we went for two things that are hard or not recommended to do
   in real life: being a God and being a bit evil. Sea Salt takes place in
   a setting inspired by HP Lovecraft and European folklore, where you
   play as an Old God betrayed by the Bishop of your own religion. After
   you granted your followers food, fortune, and fair winds for their
   fishing boats, The Bishop, who lead your human followers on land,
   turned out to be an unworthy coward when it was time to pay the final
   price...so now, when the deal between man and the Old God of the sea is

   Who likes a road trip? Visiting places new, visiting places familiar,
   spending time with family, keeping an eye on petrol and maybe even
   getting your hands dirty to repair the car – this is exactly what
   Jalopy’s all about. You’ll set out on a grand journey through the
   former Eastern Bloc with your uncle, driving a scrappy old car and
   navigating miles of tire changing, fuel burning, and carburettor
   busting through night and day, rain and shine. As you spend time
   playing Jalopy, you’ll become more and more accustomed to your Laika
   601 Deluxe – but let’s give you a little insight now, so that you’re

   Driven Out Consoles

In Driven Out the Protagonist is Not the Main Attraction

   by Jens Kolhammar, Developer, No Pest Productions Posted on October 1,
   2019October 1, 2019

   Enemies in games have always fascinated me. Their design, their
   animations, their moveset and the underlying AI that rules them are all
   important facets that creates something that almost feels alive. The
   main protagonist is often the focus of any game, but I find that it is
   more often the enemies that will have the biggest impact on me. Driven
   Out is designed around the idea that the enemies should be the real
   stars of the show. This was done in several ways. The most obvious one
   is enemy variation. Most enemies show up in the game only around two
   times to try to keep every single encounter impactful. However, the
   most important way I focused on enemies was that I tried to design

   A never-ending war between the fierce Githyanki and their former

   dungeon of Undermountain. Both groups are searching for a powerful and
   ancient artifact that allows entry into a fortress city contained in
   the chaotic plane of Limbo. Either faction gaining access to this
   bastion of the Githzerai order would be disastrous. While the Githyanki
   and Githzerai share common ancestry, philosophical differences have
   driven the two into civil war, but some have seen the larger picture
   and set their differences aside. A small band of unified Gith, composed
   of both Githyanki and Githzerai, seek to recover the artifact and
